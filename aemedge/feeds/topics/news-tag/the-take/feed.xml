  <h2 id="saps-take">SAP’s Take</h2>
  <p>The trend of “making up for lost travel time,” a knock-on effect of the <a href="/topics/covid-19">pandemic</a>, continues into the holiday season. Despite inflation and high ticket prices, people are as determined as ever to travel this holiday season — and into 2023.</p>
  <p>“Just about every TripIt user (99%) is planning a trip for the year ahead,” said Jen Moyse, vice president of product, <a href="https://www.tripit.com/">TripIt</a> from SAP Concur, a travel app that helps people organize and manage their travel plans. “Nearly one in three are planning a Christmas and New Year’s trip and one in four said they’ll travel for Thanksgiving. That’s more than what we heard last year. When we asked the same question <a href="https://www.tripit.com/web/blog/news-culture/american-travelers-practice-cautious-optimism-booking-trips">last fall</a>, only 27% of respondents said they’d travel for the winter holidays and just 19% for Thanksgiving.”</p>
  <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.tripit.com/web/blog/news-culture/tripit-data-thanksgiving-2022">Thanksgiving travel reservations</a> stored in the TripIt app are up from 2021 for domestic flights (45%), international flights (117%), car rentals (35%), lodging (46%) and vacation rentals (26%).</p>
  <h2 id="be-prepared">Be Prepared</h2>
  <p>Summer travel was exceptionally turbulent, with flight delays and cancellations disrupting travel for 57% of TripIt users, according to a <a href="https://www.tripit.com/web/blog/news-culture/tripit-survey-shoulder-season-travel">recent survey</a>. While the travel industry has learned from the experience, 93% of the people who plan to travel over the holidays say they will adjust their behaviors to accommodate potential cancellations and delays.</p>
  <p>“Some will arrive at the airport earlier than they have in the past (52%), while others will be more selective with the travel providers they use (45%) and nearly as many (44%) will plan ahead for a delay and come bearing snacks and reading material,” Moyse said. “Almost half of travelers are planning not to check a bag, which is a good way to ease the stress of the unknown and keep a few factors of their trip in their control.”</p>
  <h2 id="be-early">Be Early</h2>
  <p>This may be the most expensive holiday travel season in recent years, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/thanksgiving-christmas-travel-to-lift-airfare.html">industry experts</a>. TripIt survey findings reveal that approximately half of respondents say they are spending more money on travel due to inflation (52%), rising airfare (49%) and gas prices (29%).</p>
  <p>Moyse said that the best way to prepare is to expect and budget for higher prices. She advised booking travel early to avoid sell-outs. She shared her tips: “Check your saved-up points and miles, set alerts for travel deals, use a tool like Fare Tracker in TripIt Pro to secure refunds or investigate programs your credit card provides. Consider looking at flights that might be less desirable for others, like red-eyes or flights on the holidays themselves.”</p>
  <p>If you plan to travel in 2023, she advised, “It’s safe to assume travel prices will remain high for the foreseeable future, so if you want to make travel a priority, budget accordingly and evaluate the number or types of trips you’re planning to take.”</p>
  <h2 id="be-flexible">Be Flexible</h2>
  <p>Plan for the unexpected and you won’t be disappointed, so goes the saying that seems to perfectly describe holiday travel. Indeed, there is a higher probability of travel disruptions around Thanksgiving and the winter holidays in part due to labor shortages and inclement weather. “Build in buffer days for important events, and regularly monitor your flight should the time change or any other adjustments be made to the schedule,” Moyse said.</p>
  <p>“To avoid holiday mishaps, travelers who have flexibility should avoid the busiest travel days,” she said. “<a href="https://www.tripit.com/web/blog/news-culture/tripit-data-thanksgiving-2022">This Thanksgiving</a>, the busiest travel days will be Wednesday, November 23, followed by Tuesday, November 22. Plan for crowds and long lines, especially at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Boston Logan International Airport, Denver International Airport, and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.”</p>

      <div><strong>What’s News</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>All eyes Thursday will be on the release October’s U.S. consumer price index (CPI) figure, a benchmark reflecting the rate of inflation. Some food prices, such as orange juice, have already reached record levels and are expected to go even higher as the impact of Hurricane Ida on Florida’s citrus industry is reflected in prices.</p>
  <p>But inflation has impacted prices across the board — from juice to jeans — prompting consumer products companies to find new ways to please the consumer while growing profits.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="saps-take">SAP’s Take</h2>
  <p>For more than two years, consumer products companies have been grappling with supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, sustainability rules, war-related food ingredient shortages and now the newest factor: inflation-induced consumer buying patterns.</p>
  <p>“These various forces are causing massive amounts of complexity in the business,” said Edward Kenney, SAP senior vice president of Consumer Products, Industry Business Units. “Their costs are increasing at a rate they can’t pass along.”</p>
  <p>In some cases, producers are shrinking the size of their products while holding prices. In others, they are looking to change their formulas, Kenney said.</p>
  <p>As consumer products companies are limited in their ability to pass along full cost increases, inflation is fueling their chief anxiety: how to grow profitability.</p>
  <p>“It used to be very consistent and very easily predicted,” Kenney said. “They attracted new customers in new geographic areas. That kind of expansion has really hit the end of the road. Now, you have to get more of a share of a wallet of a given customer who has gotten infinitely more selective and has infinitely more choices than they’ve ever had.”</p>
  <p>Digitization is helping some producers deal with changes in all these factors and their impacts on each other, “because this macroeconomic problem impacts supply and demand and everything in between,” Kenney explained. “Those end-to-end processes that consumer companies rely on — things like formulation, production planning, scheduling, distribution and promotion — are elongated processes and are very hard to pivot and change. Complexity is significantly greater than it’s ever been before.”</p>
  <p>As the complexity grows, consumer product producers are looking to automate more processes, especially when they need to pivot quickly to change a formula, a supplier or any other step in a process.</p>
  <p>“If you don’t have some level of automation and intelligence to help guide the decision-making, you can end up not only making the wrong decisions,” Kenney said, “you can end up causing disruption through your value chain.”</p>
  <p>In the past, companies used optimization decisioning tools to balance one or two variables, such as available capacity and operating margin to maximize revenue, Kenney explained. Today, simple optimizations won’t work; the inter-reliance on the growing list of changing variables that producers face is prompting some to use artificial intelligence (AI) to help guide them.</p>
  <p>“You have to have the ability to balance off multiple variables and come up with the best trade off decision in the moment,” Kenney said. “And because so many variables are happening across many aspects of the business, no one person can do that. Artificial intelligence is a way that a lot of companies express this multivariable optimization.”</p>
