      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Remember watching sci-fi movies where robots moved, worked, and communicated with regular humans? How “futuristic” this felt at the time. In today’s <a href="/2021/11/industry-40-updated-whitepaper">Industry 4.0 reality</a>, robots are commonplace and populate many manufacturing and warehouse facilities around the world.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Bechtle</strong>, one of Europe’s most well-known <a href="https://www.bechtle.com/">IT service providers</a> offering more than 40,000 hardware and software products to the industrial and public sector, is a prime example of how Industry 4.0 works in the real world.</p>
  <p>When Bechtle set a goal to boost its e-commerce business by 250%, it required handling approximately two times as many packages. And when COVID-19 forced people to spend more time at home, the demand for home office equipment boomed.</p>
  <p>To meet high this high demand, Bechtle needed to employ more warehouse workers to increase its delivery capacity. However, due to low unemployment in the region, finding workers was difficult. This led the innovative company to think out of the box.</p>
  <p>Knowing that current manual warehouse processes could not support the goal, Bechtle searched for a new solution. The answer was to transform <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management/supply-chain-logistics.html">logistics</a> services with Industry 4.0. by deploying <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management/industry-4-0.html?campaigncode=CRM-YD21-SOC-CUSTREF&#x26;video=30443ce7-f37d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b">autonomous mobile robots</a> in its warehouse to transform supply chain operations.</p>
  <p>The integration of robotics within its warehouse was seen as an important first step in the company’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2020-10-industry4now-experience/">Industry 4.0</a> journey.</p>

  <h2 id="bridging-the-gap-between-manual-processes-and-automation">Bridging the Gap Between Manual Processes and Automation</h2>
  <p>Bechtle recently co-innovated with SAP integrating autonomous mobile robots with SAP Extended Warehouse Management (SAP EWM).</p>
  <p><a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/extended-warehouse-management/warehouse-robotics">SAP Warehouse Robotics</a> delivers predefined scenarios that integrate autonomous mobile robots of virtually any vendor very easily. Robots navigate through the warehouse using LIDAR, laser scanners, or 3D cameras to enable simultaneous localization and mapping in a warehouse to operate safely, side by side with humans.</p>
  <p>“With SAP Warehouse Robotics, we have found a way to manage our warehouse even more effectively and flexibly, and provide better support to our employees,” said Klaus Kratz, director of Logistics at Bechtle Logistik &#x26; Service GmbH. “Our customer promise is ‘each order should be shipped on the same day.’”</p>
  <h2 id="enhancing-the-customer-experience">Enhancing the Customer Experience</h2>
  <p>Bechtle retains 25,000 square meters of storage area to manage, the equivalent of more than three football fields.</p>
  <p>As a first step, the company looked at automating cross-docking operations, where goods arrive at the receiving dock and are issued directly to a customer order instead of being put away into storage. The robot moves a cart and drops it at the shipping dock. A planned second step will be the automation of put-away operations. As a result, Bechtle calculates <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management/industry-4-0.html?campaigncode=CRM-YD21-SOC-CUSTREF&#x26;video=30443ce7-f37d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b">savings of more than 30%</a>of costs in these operations.</p>
  <p>Automated logistics does not only shape supply chains to be leaner but also helps keep deliveries on time.</p>
  <p>“We proved that Industry 4.0 efforts, such as adding robotics to warehouse operations, can directly enhance the customer experience as well,” said Christian Deppisch, head of Innovation Management at Bechtle Logistik &#x26; Service GmbH. “Imagine a customer orders the product at 4:00 p.m. and the product will be handed over to the carrier on the same day, despite the high level of order volumes.”</p>
  <p>This process integration was complete in about four weeks — quite a time savings compared to traditional integration projects that can typically take up to 18 months.</p>
  <h2 id="rise-of-human-empowerment">Rise of Human Empowerment</h2>
  <p>Automating flexible <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/extended-warehouse-management.html">warehouse operations</a> makes operations much easier to maintain. The new process will help free up human employees from repetitive tasks, redeploying them to other value-added tasks, and ease their workload.</p>
  <p>“As we were considering the logistics problem, we needed to carefully manage organizational change,” said Kratz. “We had to communicate clearly to our staff that flexible automation was the only way to meet our goals and that we would continue to value their contribution by expanding their qualification toward more demanding and customer-individual tasks, and relieving them from monotonous activities.”</p>
  <p>Operators enjoy the freedom of leveraging robots from different suppliers, through <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/extended-warehouse-management/warehouse-robotics">SAP Warehouse Robotics</a>, which makes it easy to cover spikes in demand.</p>
  <p>In the near future, the innovative IT provider is also planning to expand the use of robotics — such as using robotic arms in operations — within its warehouse operations. By socializing robots with human employees in an integrated unified ecosystem, the company is on its way to double the revenue in the next 10 years, from €5 billion in 2020 to €10 billion in 2030.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>“With a growing number of customers and increasingly complex supply chain processes, VDL needed to replace its legacy system with a modern and flexible IT landscape to support our clear <a href="/topics/industry-4-0">Industry 4.0</a> vision to drive efficiencies and be ready for the future.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These were the words of Pepijn Timmermans, vice president of Digitalization at VDL Nedcar, who I recently had the chance to speak to about how the company modernized and digitalized its yard operations.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-vdl-nedcar">What Is VDL Nedcar?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.vdlnedcar.nl/en">VDL Nedcar</a> is not just the only independent contract manufacturer in the Netherlands but also one of the most advanced vehicle manufacturers in Europe. The 50-year-old company builds high-quality cars for major brands such as BMW, as well as a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) variant of the MINI Countryman. And as a company that banks on strong partnerships and innovation, VDL will also build electric vehicles for their newest customer, the U.S. company Canoo.</p>
  <h2 id="how-to-manage-a-yard-full-of-moving-products">How to Manage a Yard Full of Moving Products</h2>
  <p>VDL Nedcar faced the challenge of managing the movement of vehicles, parts, and materials. “We have 1,000 parts suppliers, 12,000 parts numbers, and seven carriers who bring all these parts by truck to our plant, which results in an inbound of 270 full trucks per day coming in and going out,” Timmermans explained.</p>
  <p>“The automotive industry has a closed loop where packaging material is brought back to the supplier. This means transport can arrive at any moment and within only one hour the driver drops a trailer, picks up another with packaging materials, and leaves the yard,” he added. “We have to manage 350 trailers in our yard. Basically, it’s a warehouse management system for trailers.”</p>
  <p>The process to do this was very manual. When a carrier came in, they picked an empty spot in the yard, filled out papers, and took them to the office where the information was put into the system. This was a very labor-intensive and error-prone process, and, as Timmermans explained, “If we missed only one trailer, the impact could be dramatic and costly.” A missed trailer of a vital part could harm the production processes and even lead to major stoppages of the plant for a full day, which relies on a just-in-time approach.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The answer was to analyze business processes. “We have a very unique inbound logistics supply chain concept. I think we are the only one of the OEMs in Europe who has control of inbound transport fully in our own hands,” Timmermans said. “In our material requirement system, we also integrate the whole of inbound logistics transport planning as part of the <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-mrp/">material requirement planning</a>, which makes us unique and enables us to have very efficient inbound logistics.”</p>
  <p>“We established a ‘warehouse on wheels’ concept, which optimizes our transport efficiency,” he said. “Instead of booking a time slot days ahead with the risk of long waiting times at the gate and manual management of documents in the past, carriers can arrive at our plant 24/7, sign in at the gate, get a parking location assigned for the trailer, and receive a note where to pick up an empty trailer with packaging materials.”</p>
  <h2 id="managing-the-logistics-of-the-yard">Managing the Logistics of the Yard</h2>
  <p>To get full control and transparency of this warehouse on wheels, VDL Nedcar implemented <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/yard-logistics.html">SAP Yard Logistics</a>.</p>
  <p>“Based on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/yard-logistics.html">SAP Yard Logistics</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/fiori.html">SAP Fiori apps</a>, we developed a solution where our six dock master trucks that drive the trailers from the yard to the loading dock and empty back to the yard can be steered fully automatically,” Timmermans explained. “The trucks are equipped with industrial flat screens and connected to the solution. All movement triggers are visualized for the dock masters and they get automated priorities for which trailer to transport where, including an optimization algorithm to indicate which truck is close to the trailer to be picked up. Getting this process automated and optimized saved one employee per shift.”</p>
  <p>“Previously, we also did a manual weekly inventory of all trailers on the yard for which we needed one man day per week. That has all gone,” he added.</p>
  <p>“SAP Yard Logistics helps us cooperate with our suppliers much better. We have an easier, digitalized, and transparent process at the gate for our carriers, which boosts efficiency, reduces waiting time, and eases administration,” he said.</p>
  <p><strong>Tangible benefits</strong> include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increased process transparency</li>
    <li>Reduced administrative effort of one day per week</li>
    <li>Time savings thanks to inventory automation</li>
    <li>Efficiency gains due to automated and digitalized processes on the yard saving one employee per shift</li>
    <li>Reduced waiting time for carriers and enabling them to plan better</li>
    <li>Streamlined and transparent processes at the gate</li>
    <li>Almost no incidents or administrative mistakes</li>
    <li>Standard solution that is integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>“In the future, we plan to connect our yard logistics processes with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/transportation-logistics.html">SAP Transportation Management</a> to provide a self-service portal for the carriers, automate gate processes with cameras, and leverage <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/extended-warehouse-management.html">SAP Extended Warehouse Management</a> to get full transparency across the entire supply chain,” Timmermans concluded.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Headquartered in Gurugram, a city located about 30 kilometers southwest of India’s national capital New Delhi, VE Commercial Vehicles Ltd. is regarded as the most successful joint venture in the Indian commercial vehicle industry.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In 2008, two leading players in the commercial vehicle business – Volvo Group and Eicher Motors – joined forces with a common vision of driving modernization in the commercial transport business in India. Volvo Group brought in global expertise, leadership in product technology, well-defined processes, and a brand respected all over the world. Eicher Motors, a leader in the light and medium vehicle segment, contributed with frugal engineering, considerable after-sales infrastructure, and cost-effective operations.</p>
  <p>VE Commercial Vehicles Ltd. (VECV) is comprised of six business verticals: Eicher Trucks and Buses, Volvo Trucks India, Eicher Engineering Components, VE Powertrain, VECV Engine Business, and Volvo Bus India. The company includes the exclusive distribution of Volvo Trucks in India, engine manufacturing and exports for Volvo Group, non-automotive engines, and the Eicher component business. A multi-brand, multi-division company backed by innovative products and services, VECV is recognized as a leader its industry today.</p>
  <h2 id="mastering-highly-complex-assembly-processes-at-minimum-cost">Mastering Highly Complex Assembly Processes at Minimum Cost</h2>
  <p>Commercial truck manufacturing involves highly complex assembly operations due to the large number of variants, the thousands of parts being assembled, and the many types of tools and machines that are required.</p>
  <p>On top of this, VECV faced several challenges:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shortage of skilled manpower that made it extremely difficult to maintain quality and high productivity at minimum cost</li>
    <li>Inability to track and trace its assembly operations</li>
    <li>Considerable training effort was required for new operators as there was no system to guide operators on assembly processes while performing operations</li>
    <li>Suboptimal line efficiency, machine utilization, and operator productivity resulted in lower quality and higher rework due to lack of process controls and error-proofing</li>
    <li>Lack of data connection on the assembly line which did not allow any meaningful insights to improve process quality</li>
  </ul>

  <p>VECV needed a solution that would enable real-time monitoring of its entire manufacturing supply chain processes to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gain meaningful insights</strong> to increase overall line efficiency, productivity, and quality</li>
    <li><strong>Achieve cost savings</strong> by standardizing operational processes and equipment</li>
    <li><strong>Create standard operating procedures</strong> to guide new operators and reduce time for operator deployment on assembly lines</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce operator errors and drive efficiency</strong> by making assembly operations 100% traceable</li>
    <li><strong>Decrease costly downtime</strong> by implementing predictive maintenance for critical machinery</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Embracing <a href="/2021/09/industry-40-manufacturing-industrial-landscape">Industry 4.0 principles</a>, the vehicles company decided to adopt smart manufacturing processes by implementing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based solutions from SAP to bring shop-floor visibility to the top floor. This enables faster decision-making and provides meaningful insights to improve overall line efficiency, productivity, and quality.</p>
  <h2 id="fostering-smarter-and-leaner-operations-with-impressive-results">Fostering Smarter and Leaner Operations with Impressive Results</h2>
  <p>VECV introduced <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management/manufacturing.html">SAP Manufacturing Suite</a>, which is comprised of a number of digital manufacturing solutions that helped meet its objectives. The solution was deployed on all 10 assembly lines, each comprised of about 150 assembly stations, where over 200 machines are used to assemble about 3,000 parts.</p>
  <p>This means that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assembly operations’ standard operating procedures are now displayed in real time. Assembly machines are connected to capture more than 400 critical process parameters, ensuring tight process controls and error-proofing.</li>
    <li>Automated part selection guarantees correct selection and traceability for all 3,000 parts. The RFID integration through SAP Plant Connectivity eliminates manual interventions and <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-mes-manufacturing-execution-system/">manufacturing execution system (MES)</a> screens on assembly stations optimize efficiency.</li>
    <li>A defect capturing and feedback system improves product quality and reduces errors.</li>
    <li>A 100% labor tracking improves operator efficiency.</li>
    <li>Overall equipment efficiency calculations enable predictive maintenance of critical machines. Real-time reports provide meaningful insights and enable faster decision-making. Vibration sensors installed on six key critical machines capture data into <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/manufacturing-intelligence-integration.html">SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (SAP MII)</a> via SAP Plant Connectivity software. Data is analyzed to create an algorithm in SAP MII to predict machine failure.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SAP Manufacturing Suite enabled the company to standardize operational processes, equipment, and activities, leading to cost savings in operations and faster gains in productivity and quality. With 100% tracking and traceability of all assembly operations, troubleshooting time was significantly reduced. Tight process controls and error-proofing increased overall product quality, reduced mistakes, and improved productivity.</p>
  <p>As Sumit Goyal, senior manager IT, Digital Manufacturing, explained, “SAP Manufacturing Suite has brought many tactical and strategic benefits to VECV. It has helped improve productivity, lower operating costs, and increase quality and compliance. By gaining real-time visibility into the entire manufacturing supply chain, we are able to accelerate root-cause analysis by making fact-based decisions.”</p>
  <p>And the numbers speak for themselves. VECV has seen:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>15% productivity improvement</li>
    <li>30% process quality improvement</li>
    <li>Reduction in field failures</li>
    <li>20% improvement in manpower utilization</li>
    <li>Significant reduction in non-value-add activities through automation</li>
    <li>40% error reduction</li>
    <li>100% tracking and traceability of critical process parameters and assembled parts</li>
    <li>Zero compliance issues</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And from an IT perspective, VECV now has:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A single platform capturing data from different sources to ease system maintenance</li>
    <li>Reduced infrastructure and operational costs by removing standalone, third-party solutions used to capture data from different systems</li>
    <li>95% of machines connected with line controls and improved process quality by 20%</li>
    <li>30% reduction in unplanned downtime</li>
    <li>15% improvement in OEE (overall equipment effectiveness) management and OLE (overhead line equipment)</li>
  </ul>

        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that it has again been recognized as a Leader in the “IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Industrial IoT Platforms and Applications in Manufacturing 2021 Vendor Assessment” (doc # US47956021, June 2021) report.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“The SAP customers we interviewed revealed the trust they place in SAP’s security and data privacy model — a critical aspect for OEMs who select IIoT vendors,” said IDC Research Director Reid Paquin. “SAP’s customer references also emphasized the benefit of getting readily integrated, IoT applications for engineering, manufacturing, operations and logistics — all from one vendor to drive their Industry 4.0 transformation.”</p>
  <p>The IDC MarketScape criteria for evaluation include the comprehensiveness of business applications built on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms and the ability to integrate IoT data with enterprise or third-party systems and services. Features expected by most businesses from an IIoT platform, such as analytics, machine learning and edge deployment capabilities, were among further product characteristics that IDC analyzed in detail.</p>
  <p>According to the IDC MarketScape, “IIoT/Industry 4.0 deployments generally require multiple vendors, so being able to gain a wide variety of functionality from any one single vendor can help simplify the deployment and time to value. Customers appreciate that SAP offers them choice on where to run their workloads, including a variety of cloud options.”</p>
  <p>Businesses in nearly every industry learned in the past year that any disruption — big or small — can create a huge impact on their ability to serve the market. Supply chain resilience has become a boardroom conversation. While supply chain disruption may at first appear to be a challenge solely associated with process and discrete manufacturing industries, many sectors are dependent on manufacturers to deliver their products as services. This is where business leaders look to leverage technologies such as the IoT effectively to drive greater productivity and agility.</p>
  <p>SAP offers one of the largest portfolio solutions to manage a connected supply chain in what it calls “design to operate.” Processes within the design-to-operate spectrum are driven by a set of integrated applications that can be further enhanced to be real-world aware, automated and adaptive with the IoT. SAP is uniquely positioned to deliver Industry 4.0 transformations almost single-handedly due to its large portfolio of IoT-enabled solutions.</p>
  <p>“Being named as a Leader by the IDC MarketScape is validation of the value and flexibility we are providing to our customers,” said Mike Lackey, global VP of Digital Manufacturing at SAP. “Our <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management/industry-4-0.html">IoT solution</a> and the embedded IoT capabilities in our applications for manufacturing industries are driving productivity, resilience and sustainability across the entire supply chain.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>The manufacturing industries were early movers in digitizing business processes. Material requirements planning (MRP) was defined and digitized in the 1950s, long before the term enterprise resource planning (ERP) was coined. Over time, production and supply chain equipment were integrated with business processes for real-time insight and control. But it would take a long time until digital technology was built into the actual machinery and day-to-day operations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Add real-time connectivity over the Internet of Things (IoT) and we reach the current stage of Industry 4.0, which enables completely new business processes and business models that go beyond the classical paradigm of designing, making, and delivering products and include the operations through decommissioning, closing the cycle in the spirit of a circular economy.</p>
  <p><a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-industry-4-0?source=social-global-newscentre-blog-IEumbrella-2021-ind4.0">Industry 4.0</a> is a set of technologies used with a new mindset to drive the automation of manufacturing and operations processes with smart technology. It starts with analyzing where and how business value is generated and then designing, making, delivering, and operating solutions that drive the right business outcomes.</p>
  <p>Every industry success story starts with a new way of thinking. Maybe a customer doesn’t need a machine, but something the machine does or produces, such as powering an aircraft, making car parts from sheet metal, pumping concrete, compressing air.</p>
  <p>That’s why digitalization is first about a mindset, and then about technology. Digital leaders think about how they do things today and reimagine doing them better using digital technologies. They don’t only challenge how they do things; they challenge what they are doing.</p>
  <p>A true digital leader, for example, doesn’t just train service technicians to improve service quality and reduce costs. They might redesign their products and connect them with <a href="https://www.sap.com/uk/products/intelligent-technologies.html?source=social-global-newscentre-blog-IEumbrella-2021-ind4.0">intelligent technology</a>, enabling the machine to call the service with a list of its symptoms, so that the technician arrives with all the right spare parts on the first visit.</p>

  </div>
  <p>We have always managed business processes in real time with their material flows and their value flows — that’s standard textbook stuff today. What is new now is the way we model supply chains, products, and the manufacturing processes with digital twins through a holistic process we call <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2019/01/6c2a3938-347d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?source=social-global-newscentre-blog-IEumbrella-2021-ind4.0">design to operate</a>.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management/industry-4-0.html?source=social-global-newscentre-blog-IEumbrella-2021-ind4.0">strategy for Industry 4.0 at SAP</a> goes well beyond smart manufacturing in factories and plants. It connects production with end-to-end process execution across the supply chain so companies can reach a new level of connectivity and adapt to change on the fly.</p>
  <p>It starts with intelligent products that are designed to deliver outcomes. For example, in Brazil, tractor manufacturer <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/04/c89b44ea-d07d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?source=social-global-newscentre-blog-IEumbrella-2021-ind4.0">Stara</a> is equipping its agricultural machinery to collect real-time data about what happens in the fields. The data is used to optimize irrigation and minimize the use of fertilizers, resulting in higher yields and more sustainable farming practices.</p>
  <p>Next, it requires intelligent factories and logistics that are digitally integrated from the top floor to the shop floor, enabling faster, better decision-making on the business end whenever there are disruptions or new opportunities. For example, Porsche and press manufacturer Schuler have set up a <a href="https://www.sap.com/bin/sapdxc/inm/attachment.11358/pitch-deck.pdf?source=social-global-newscentre-blog-IEumbrella-2021-ind4.0">smart press shop</a> that allows the company to make automotive body parts in small numbers using a highly automated, flexible process.</p>
  <p>The third element in the design-to-operate process is intelligent assets such as digitalized machines that collect and combine data through sensors and from SAP solutions. <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/02/840788f2-857d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?source=social-global-newscentre-blog-IEumbrella-2021-ind4.0">Endress + Hauser</a> is a global leader in measurement instrumentation, using Industry 4.0 technology to extract and process sensor data used for predictive analytics to reduce the unplanned downtime of machines.</p>
  <p>And finally, the design-to-operate process relies on intelligent people who understand complex scenarios and are empowered to make smart decisions with the right tools. Automotive supplier <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2019/10/b4d9c6fb-6d7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?source=social-global-newscentre-blog-IEumbrella-2021-ind4.0">Schaeffler</a> has equipped its digital assistants with SAP technology that supports its employees with context-sensitive information, intuitive user interfaces, and natural language processing.</p>
  <h2 id="intelligent-decisions">Intelligent Decisions</h2>
  <p>We all know intelligence sits in the brain, but the brain is useless without a nervous system, sensors, and muscles to interact with the world around it. SAP solutions can be the intelligent tools that enable the brain of the enterprise to collect and interpret all the data they can get from their ERP systems, their shop floor systems, and their ecosystem of customers, suppliers, and service providers. This enables them to make smarter decisions — in real time.</p>
  <p>Enterprises that are truly intelligent use Industry 4.0 technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to learn from good and bad decisions. That’s how they can make better, more intelligent decisions in a manufacturing environment that is constantly changing due to varying customer demand. These are the next practices that will help manufacturing companies increase productivity while producing high quality, individualized products in a sustainable, efficient manner.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The quest for improvement and innovation to build productivity, drive greater value, and seek opportunities in new markets is perpetual for every successful business. As a result, executives and organizational leaders alike continuously evaluate their business models, offerings, and operational processes to gain any advantage they can find, especially when their products become increasingly commoditized.</div>

  <p>Based on current research, servitization appears to be an effective antidote against the ease of product switching. McKinsey &#x26; Company <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/aftermarket-services-the-near-term-growth-opportunity-in-targeting-the-right-customers">reports</a> that while margins on new product sales are typically 10%, aftermarket service margins average 25%.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-servitization">What Is Servitization?</h2>
  <p>Servitization is a strategy that product-oriented companies use to enhance and differentiate their competitiveness by integrating services into their overall business model. This shift can be seen on a continuum in which producing and selling products is coupled with a focus on adding services to the offering and ultimately integrating them. Very quickly, customer value moves from owning and using the product to capturing value with the product while services are perceived as a cost factor.</p>
  <p>While this concept is not new, widespread <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/8/2957/htm">adoption of intelligent technology</a> – such as <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-iot-internet-of-things/">the Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-machine-learning/">machine learning</a>, and <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-predictive-analytics/">predictive analytics</a> – is fueling this approach to break into new markets and fulfill underserved customer needs. More recent product-service <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bse.414">servitization models</a> may include bundled support services, consumption or pay-for-use, and outcome-based services.</p>
  <p>An earlier form of servitization emerged in 1962 when <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases-archive/yr-2012/121030-the-hour.aspx">Rolls-Royce</a> pioneered its famous “Power by the Hour” engine maintenance service concept. This model allowed airlines to pay for the time spent maintaining and replacing their aircraft engine. As technology advanced, sensors were incorporated for engine-condition monitoring and predictive maintenance services.</p>
  <p>A few decades later, tire manufacturer Michelin redefined the service-oriented model to help trucking companies reduce fuel consumption. Payment for the service is based on achieving predefined fuel consumption targets, tracked through telematics and IoT, and assessed in real time with data analytics.</p>
  <p>Many more companies have followed Rolls-Royce’s and Michelin’s example, including <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2019-11-sap-leonardo-customer-success/book/index.html?chapter=20">Kaeser Kompressoren</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2020/01/10/learn-how-to-obtain-a-superior-b2b-customer-experience-with-these-valuable-insights/?sh=3f981bdd7777">Grundfos</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/09/50b8398d-b27d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Tetra Pak</a>. It is noted that in all cases, IT – specifically IoT and <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-industry-4-0/">Industry 4.0</a> – <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311206173_The_servitization_of_industry_EU_law_implications_and_challenges">plays a significant role</a> in enabling product-service servitization.</p>
  <p>Over time, this approach has become a critical component of manufacturers’ growth strategies. In fact, a <a href="https://www.paconsulting.com/globalassets/downloads/servitization-report.pdf">survey</a> of 60 European industrial manufacturing firms reported that servitization increases average growth margin from services delivered ranging between 15% and 35%. Another <a href="https://www.porsche-consulting.com/fileadmin/docs/04_Medien/Publikationen/745199_Beyond_the_product/Beyond_the_Product_C_2021_Porsche_Consulting-v3.pdf">survey</a> found that the 10% total returns to shareholders (TRS) achieved by servitization champions significantly exceeded the -1% median TRS of their peers. And in the spirit of these findings, Professor Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327583386_THE_SERVITIZATION_IN_INDUSTRY_40_FACING_CHALLENGES_AND_TENDENCIES">identified</a> servitization as one of the megatrends that will shape the future of business and society.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the advantages servitization offers, many businesses still question how to best recognize and adopt appropriate service options that deliver the best value to the customer. Some of the challenges encountered include culture change, competency adoption, process, system creation, and commercialization.</p>
  <p>In many ways, a transformation journey toward servitization includes four fundamental maturity stages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Splintered:</strong> The organization struggles under a myriad of silos that lead to disjointed, manual processes. Legacy, fragmented enterprise resource planning (ERP) environments provide little or no visibility on operational performance. The business model is on pure product, with challenges to profitability.</li>
    <li><strong>Side car:</strong> The organization has standardized the two chunks of the value chain – back and front desk – but keeps them separated. Since efficiency is critical at this stage, few add-on services are delivered, field services are based on basic mobile capabilities, and IoT stacks are only proofs of concept.</li>
    <li><strong>Joined up:</strong> Front- and back-office flows are integrated bidirectionally and leverage advanced technologies, such as IoT, to feed core systems with real-time data. In some cases, edge capabilities bring coordinated autonomy to local sites, a suite of digital services are made fully available, and business model enhancements including pay-as-you-use and outcome-based contracts are actively explored.</li>
    <li><strong>Borderless:</strong> Processes start and end outside the organization and operations, while technology enables different elements of the value chain to connect. Co-creation, data-sharing, and collaboration with customers, suppliers, partners from other sectors, and even competitors are part of the business model.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After demonstrating the importance of servitization during existing economic conditions and business performance, appropriate servitization concepts steadily replace the status quo, closing the gap between strategic intent and realized goals.</p>
  <p>A critical part of progressing servitization maturity is transforming the business culture to encourage leaders and employees to <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09564230310474138/full/html">shift their perception</a> of services from add-ons or giveaways to a valued part of the business model.</p>
  <p>According to Guido Schlief, senior vice president and head of Services in Middle and Eastern Europe at SAP, “Our observation is that customers increasingly expect business outcomes from their suppliers – outcome-based services are a clear industry trend.”</p>
  <p>Successfully embracing this shift can have a significant effect on the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225473204_Exploring_the_financial_consequences_of_the_servitization_of_manufacturing">profitability</a> of a servitized business. Deep insights into customer needs are required to design value-added services that are valuable from the market perspective, not from the supplier side. For example, although monitoring of equipment condition has limited value to the customer, equipment availability directly impacts the customer experience.</p>
  <p>Product companies must also consider a servitization model that shifts upfront transactional sales and payments to long-term contracts with perpetual payments, enabling customer-centric relationship building. <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09564230310474138/full/html">Successful delivery of this approach</a> demands an effective services organization, resembling a professional services firm containing the right processes, tools, and personnel who possess specialized skills. Although service personnel typically <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225473204_Exploring_the_financial_consequences_of_the_servitization_of_manufacturing">cost</a> more than manufacturing personnel, the investment can help <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/8/2957/htm">overcome critical hurdles</a>, such as lack of knowledge in systematic transformation and the ability to make required changes, in gaining the full benefit of servitization.</p>

  <p><em>Figure 1: Servitization performance balanced scorecard. Click to enlarge.</em></p>
  <p>Over time, the transformation into a servitization model can be assessed to help ensure it satisfies the core needs of the business: financial, internal, customers, innovation, and learning. For example, pure financial measures – such as service revenue growth or services market share – can be <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322834491_Measuring_servitization_progress_and_outcome_the_case_of_&#x27;advanced_services&#x27;">evaluated</a> alongside a proposed a balanced scorecard to provide a comprehensive view on servitization performance (See Figure 1).</p>
  <h2 id="get-ready-servitization-is-here-to-stay">Get Ready: Servitization Is Here to Stay</h2>
  <p>As customers gain less interest in the shiny new functionalities of new products and pay more attention to the outcomes they achieve, all signs point to the growing importance of services as a competitive differentiator.</p>
  <p>But remember, servitization is more than a pure vertical integration of the business model and goes far beyond add-on or giveaway services. In essence, it is a strategic transformation that spans across most business silos, requiring alignment between the business and IT and between the front and back office of the supplier.</p>
  <p>And if approached appropriately, the new business model can open new sources of revenue and bring a fundamental shift from a reactive break-fix mentality to proactive outcome-based services.</p>

      <div>The future of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-enterprise.html">Intelligent Enterprise</a> will depend on high-speed digital connectivity to enable powerful innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge services to manage supply chains and deliver new experiences. To meet this demand, 5G (fifth-generation wireless networking technology) is increasingly being deployed to process the vast amounts of data being collected from the connected devices that power the Intelligent Enterprise.</div>

  <h2 id="enterprises-unlock-the-value-of-5g-with-sap">Enterprises Unlock the Value of 5G with SAP</h2>
  <p>Since the launch of <a href="/2019/02/sap-5g-innovation-council-accelerates-new-business-models">SAP’s 5G Innovation Council</a> in 2018, SAP has been leveraging its unique cross-industry expertise, rich partner ecosystem, and global coverage to unlock value from 5G projects for its customers. In collaboration with a network of strategic partners, SAP is engaging customers in innovation sessions to identify and prioritize use cases that tap new revenue models and monetization strategies.</p>
  <p>Some of these projects include augmented reality (AR)-enabled immersive consumer experiences, guaranteed payments in a stadium using 5G <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GSMA-An-Introduction-to-Network-Slicing.pdf">network slicing</a>, omnichannel retail with frictionless payments, and robotic surgeries in healthcare, as well as autonomous forklifts and robotic service drones for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management/industry-4-0.html">Industry 4.0</a>.</p>
  <p>“Where we’ve really seen the power of 5G is around private network deployments for enterprise customers,” says Frank Wilde, vice president, Global Center of Excellence, SAP Labs in Palo Alto, who has been working with SAP customers to integrate 5G technology into their digital strategy. SAP is positioned to work with customers to maximize the potential of their custom use cases or any of the more than 30 industry use cases that SAP has available for retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and oil and gas. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> offering and digital transformation as a service means even greater possibilities for customers to take control of their digital journey when implementing new innovations.</p>
  <h2 id="5g-ultra-wideband-networks-enable-the-intelligent-enterprise">5G Ultra-Wideband Networks Enable the Intelligent Enterprise</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers/82400/what-is-5g">advantages of 5G</a> over the current standard 4G arguably include: greater bandwidth for faster data processing; lower latency for greater responsiveness, which produces even greater benefits when combined with edge computing; and the ability to have more devices connected to the network simultaneously, which has huge implications for IoT-enabled sensors and smart devices. For the enterprise, among the greatest benefits come from 5G’s capacity for <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GSMA-An-Introduction-to-Network-Slicing.pdf">network slicing</a>, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/5g-latency">low latency</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/edge-services.html#:~:text=SAP%20Edge%20Services%20enables%20powerful,edge%20with%20SAP%20Edge%20Services.">edge computing</a>.</p>
  <p>5G technology is a game changer for the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-enterprise.html">Intelligent Enterprise</a>; however, the 5G opportunity can still be something of a black box for decision-makers. Some may question why 4G isn’t good enough. Wilde responds by emphasizing the case for greater automation and simplification that is possible within a 5G network. “When you compare a 5G environment to a 4G environment, it’s like an eight-lane highway to a two-lane highway,” says Wilde. “You have additional bandwidth to work with and software-defined networking capabilities to be able to charge for services and create network slices. It’s a much more tightly coupled network.”</p>

  <p>Strategic partnerships are the backbone of SAP’s strategy in the 5G space, allowing it to capitalize on its enterprise business strengths while drawing on the multi-varied strengths of a vast ecosystem of technology partners. As a global company, SAP has built deep partnerships with the telecommunications industry across all regions. That approach brings big benefits for customers in the form of global coverage for their 5G projects using an established reference architecture to globally deploy a 5G edge platform or set of services.</p>
  <p>“SAP is uniquely positioned so that we can sit down with each telco globally and deploy a merchant 5G service that a small-to-medium business can leverage anywhere around the world,” says Wilde, who supports the need for partnerships to successfully deploy 5G solutions. “We’re streamlining the value chain around telcos, hardware manufacturers, software providers, and service integrators. We do the heavy lifting for our customers, which is one of the core value-adds that SAP is able to bring. We have both the customer network and the partner network to bring these solutions to life, unlike our competition.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>Opportunities with the Internet of Things (IoT) are enormous, there is no doubt about it. It was during my time living in New York City a few years back, where I was excited the first time by an IoT application.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To explore New York’s tourist sights, there is a mobile app that shows you the live visitor streams in one of the impressive skyscrapers. This allows you to decide the best time for a tour and to enjoy a view from the visitor terrace. The app also allowed registered users to change the colors of the illuminated antenna at night time, which was a great trick to impress any visitors I hosted in the city.</p>
  <p>While this use case was certainly a great party trick, it is no comparison to the business value we see when equipping machines, equipment, transport boxes, containers, or devices with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/iot-data-services.html?url_id=text-glo-404-reclink">Industrial Internet of Things</a> (IIoT) capabilities.</p>
  <p>In the past year, manufacturers all over the world experienced significant disruptions that can impact globally optimized supply chains. Running resilient operations — highly productive and interconnected with a network of suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers, and customers — is key to weathering the storms of disruption.</p>
  <p>Resiliency allows companies to withstand disruptions and, more importantly, to drive business process transformations of entire operating models. Thereby, <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2020-10-industry4now-experience/">Industry 4.0</a> technologies, such as IIoT and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/edge-services.html">edge computing</a>, have proven significant enablers. Optimized production, improved decision making based on higher visibility, and supply chain transparency are just a few examples of the many opportunities that IIoT provides.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we see even more in it; we see the opportunity for companies to better understand their businesses, redefine business models, and meet new customer demands — all while achieving sustainability goals.</p>
  <p>By embedding IIoT capabilities and making industrial data available to line-of-business and industry applications such as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management.html">SAP Digital Supply Chain</a>, we enable new business processes, empowering customers to connect entire industry value chains.</p>
  <h2 id="enabling-industry-4now-with-smart-sensing">Enabling Industry 4.Now with Smart Sensing</h2>
  <p>To help customers move more swiftly with their <a href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73554900100800002247&#x26;range=CURRENT-LAST#Q2%202021">transformation strategies in 2021</a>, we recently released “smart sensing” capabilities. The reason? Industry 4.0 requires the digital identification and localization of people, assets, machines, deliveries, and other business objects. Smart sensing technology helps to not just exchange this information between physical objects and enterprise applications, but also to track the associated business objects to automatically steer process steps and actions. Cloud technology enables not only the possibility to process large numbers of scanning events in parallel, but also provides a powerful decision and rules engine to “translate” insights to actions, allowing customers to leverage intelligence at almost every business process they can imagine.</p>
  <p>The smart sensing capabilities are offered as part of SAP IoT and enable customers to automatically correlate the movement of physical objects to specific process steps by scanning ID-tags such as RFID, barcode, QR code, or image recognition.</p>
  <p>Let’s have a look at a few examples:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Smart Sensing Technology in a Logistics Scenario</strong> Think about a manufacturer of high voltage batteries that sends the products out for delivery to an automobile manufacturer. Each movement of a physical item — for example, product, pallet, container, etc. — has an implicit meaning for the progress of the business process execution. Sending a battery out for delivery to a customer means “goods issue,” receiving a delivery means “goods receipt.” By equipping these batteries with RFID tags, a “goods issue” or “goods receipt” can be created automatically in SAP S/4HANA as soon as it passes an RFID gate at the warehouse dock, for example. Based on the scan event, it can be detected if the correct handling units and the correct number of handling units have been shipped. In this way, the battery manufacturer can reduce manual efforts and thereby also avoid human mistakes.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Smart Sensing Technology in a Handling-Unit Tracking Scenario:</strong> Being part of one solution, we can now also combine the power of smart sensing tags with sensors for IoT. An example: By equipping the transport boxes of our batteries with IoT sensors, we can now automatically create a digital twin of these handling units based on an ID scan with smart sensing. As a consequence, conditions of the batteries — such as temperature, humidity, or shocks to the unit — are tracked during the transport and warehouse processes in real time. In case an issue occurs with the delivery, the sales or logistics manager will be notified in SAP S/4HANA immediately and receives proposals on how to solve the issue. Such proposals can be to create a customer return, send an express replacement order, or to inform the affected customer about the situation. This increase of supply chain transparency enables the battery manufacturer to react faster and more effectively when issues occur and to ultimately extend the average lifespan of the batteries.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Smart Sensing Technology in a Production Scenario:</strong> Another example taken from production is <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/03/taking-manufacturing-optimization-one-step-further-iot-enabled-kanban/">SAP IoT-enabled Kanban</a>. During the production of our high voltage batteries, the manufacturer leverages Kanban, a scheduling system for lean manufacturing to improve manufacturing efficiency and to avoid excess inventory at any point in production. By equipping kanban containers or shelves with RFID tags, status changes — for example, empty, full, in use, etc. — are triggered in SAP S/4HANA. This status update automatically triggers replenishment at the warehouse or at the supplier. The real-time analytics of location and retention time of raw material enables the manufacturer to optimize stock level as well as line runners’ routes.</p>

  <p>In order to provide reliable connectivity among machines, people, processes, and assets, the scenarios described above will soon be <a href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?range=CURRENT-LAST&#x26;PRODUCT=73554900100800001107#Q2%202021">extended to the edge</a>. In latency-sensitive scenarios, relevant business data from SAP S/4 HANA business objects is synchronized from cloud to the edge nod such as a gateway in a factory or at a warehouse. Scanning events through auto-ID devices can now be enhanced with relevant business data locally. In this way, configurable business rules and actions can be instantly processed and analyzed at the edge. The consequence for the business is that no pallet, truck, or Kanban box will ever stand still, as even during intermittent Internet connectivity, the show will go on based on the edge compute right at the site.</p>
  <p>The physical proximity of applications and devices make it easier to achieve low-latency responses and to optimize bandwidth consumption by sending only relevant data to the cloud. Compounded with various benefits in terms of data privacy and cost savings, it helps ensure business continuity and offline operations even for the most mission-critical processes when connectivity is not available or unstable.</p>
  <h2 id="edge-containerization">Edge Containerization</h2>
  <p>Bringing software from the cloud to the edge happens via so called containers. A container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application plus all its dependencies and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into a single package. Containers provide the answer to the question of how software can run reliably when moved from one computing environment (cloud) to another (edge). Such containers may be only a few megabytes in size, which makes them ideal for running on edge devices with limited hardware resources.</p>
  <p>Kubernetes is the de-facto standard for container orchestration in the cloud or edge. By embracing Kubernetes at the edge, SAP moves toward a uniform approach in service management across cloud and edge. SAP Edge Services provides a centralized fully fledged edge lifecycle management using Kubernetes for services and applications, including the possibility to deploy extensions, while enabling consistent execution across cloud and edge.</p>
  <h2 id="bring-your-own-data-lake">Bring Your Own Data Lake</h2>
  <p>IIoT and edge computing are critical enablers for connecting industry value chains, running businesses in real time, and driving a step-change in productivity. Yet our vision is to go one step further and empower customers to leverage more data than ever before. “Real world thing-data,” coming from machines, devices, industrial cameras, or sensors by themselves are useless. Only by combining IoT data, such as a detected shock of a sensor, with business data, such as deliveries, materials, or production orders, can we truly generate business value.</p>
  <p>Our strategy of “bring your own data lake” will enable customers to integrate data from their own Big Data stores into SAP applications. With this, customers can leverage and integrate different kind of data formats, allowing them to contextualize their “thing” data with application business data to transform from insights and analysis to action.</p>
  <p>The potential of IIoT is not just in connecting millions of devices, or the antenna of a skyscraper with users, but to really turn the data they generate into intelligent insights and derive action. As the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> crisis amplified the need for business and supply chain resilience, IIoT will be embedded into more business processes than ever before — enabling entirely new business models. Through this, businesses can rapidly scale their productivity, product quality, sustainability, and even customer experience goals, leading to happy and engaged end customers.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Many of us take advantage of Internet of Things (IoT) innovations in our personal lives, where the benefits of connected sensors and IoT are well understood. But what excites me is the transformative promise of IoT in the industrial world. That is why we are kicking off a series to showcase the business value of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the industrial sector, IIoT has emerged as a significant value driver in the manufacturing industry. It has changed the way goods are produced and delivered by connecting all phases of the design-to-operate product life cycle, including ideation and conceptualizing, manufacturing, delivery, and operations.</p>
  <h2 id="a-need-that-is-here-to-stay-building-resilience-beyond-the-crisis">A Need That Is Here to Stay: Building Resilience Beyond the Crisis</h2>
  <p>The strong uptake of IIoT reflects an increasing need for business resilience. Even before the pandemic, manufacturing companies operated in an increasingly volatile environment, requiring them to adapt quickly to shifting priorities. <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> accelerated this trend. As consumer demands changed dramatically and manufacturing capacities were constrained, supply chains broke, forcing businesses to cope with the disruption of their daily operations.</p>
  <p>While the world will hopefully overcome COVID-19 at some point, new health, societal, geopolitical, or economic crises are likely to occur. That is why an increased need for business and supply chain resilience is here to stay — and IIoT and <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2020-10-industry4now-experience/">Industry 4.0</a> will help take us there.</p>
  <p>When we look at which companies were able to overcome these challenges, it is clear that it was highly digitalized businesses capable of taking informed decisions based on real-time data. IIoT technologies played a major role in helping them to repurpose production, provide help where needed, and find alternative routes to maintain <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management.html">supply chains</a>.</p>
  <p>Take INDEX-Werke as an example: the traditional supplier for the automotive industry kept its own business and that of its customers running throughout the crisis. Based on SAP Commerce Cloud, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjV4WUWGNpU">INDEX-Werke offers its parts online and provides technical support remotely</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The opportunities are enormous, but many companies that I speak with are wondering where and when to start. Given the disruption we see among our customers in almost every industry, I believe that companies can start small, but should start now.</p>
  <h2 id="introducing-new-business-models-from-product-to-outcome">Introducing New Business Models: From Product to Outcome</h2>
  <div class="promo">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>IIoT enables new business models and the shift from selling products to delivering services and solutions. The underlying idea of outcome-based models is that customers pay for what they get out of a product rather than for the product itself. In addition, IIoT opens the door to a fully personalized customer experience. Data exchange between a customer and a smart factory makes it possible to produce a highly customized product within just a few days — from receiving an order to shipping the goods.</p>
  <p>For example, when <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/submission-details-2021.html?idea_id=2160">VEM</a>, a leading manufacturer of electronic motors, was looking for a way to differentiate its products, the company identified a growing demand for remote monitoring. Together with SAP, the company created a custom app with monitoring and alerting capabilities. VEM’s sensor-equipped motors not only reduced operational downtime and extended product lifetime, they also helped achieve a 25% revenue increase. Most importantly, the company was able to reinvent its business model completely.</p>
  <h2 id="operating-in-industry-networks-if-the-ecosystem-wins-everyone-wins">Operating in Industry Networks: If the Ecosystem Wins, Everyone Wins</h2>
  <p>Just recently, I <a href="http://sie.ag/3qREyyz">talked with Cedrik Neike</a>, CEO Digital Industries at Siemens, about the importance of partnerships to accelerate the industrial transformation. We spoke about moving from enterprise resource planning (ERP) to network resource planning, and from “ego-systems” to ecosystems where the players strive for added value together.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we envision that enterprises will exchange data via an industry network of suppliers, machine manufacturers, and customers. We are addressing this with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html">SAP Business Network</a> and thereby enabling a shift from a seller/buyer paradigm to collaborative models. When, for example, data from production quality records is shared between suppliers and manufacturers, they can collaboratively resolve warranty claims and recalls.</p>
  <p>SAP actively uses and contributes to various industry standards that build the foundation for industry networks. SAP helped incubate the <a href="https://openindustry4.com/">Open Industry 4.0 Alliance</a> in 2019, with the goal of creating guidelines for compatible and interoperable IIoT solutions and services. Joint standards between the systems of different players in our ecosystem help drive digitalization in factories, plants, and warehouses in a collaborative manner.</p>
  <p>Sharing data beyond a company’s borders adds even more value for all the players, from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to suppliers and consumers. Strong networks rely on cooperation among companies within and across industries. SAP is a <a href="/2021/03/catena-x-automotive-alliance-picks-up-speed">founding partner of the Automotive Alliance</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/catena-x-automotive-network/">Catena-X</a>, which aims to create a unified business network for the automotive industry. The alliance’s goal is to create a consistent information exchange through the entire automotive value chain.</p>
  <h2 id="from-concept-to-execution">From Concept to Execution</h2>
  <p>Today, we have all the technology and applications at hand to connect devices, people, and processes. Making use of data across the entire product and service life cycle is the foundation of managing business processes end to end.</p>
  <p>To sustain long-term success, it is imperative for companies to move from concept to execution. This also requires a shift in our mindset. We need to rethink how data is used and set common standards. We need to rethink how businesses run and be open to new business models. And we need to rethink how markets work and move from the buyer/supplier relational paradigm to a collaborative model.</p>
  <p>If we see IIoT and Industry 4.0 as both an urgent need and an opportunity, we will not only achieve continuous optimization but we will also generate added value — both for the ecosystem we operate in and for our customers.</p>
