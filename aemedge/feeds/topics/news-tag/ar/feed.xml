      <div>For shoppers who’ve yearned for an immersive, personalized experience that’s open 24/7, mobile <a href="/topics/augmented-reality">augmented reality (AR)</a> technology is the real-time deal of the next era. Bangalore-based startup <a href="https://www.adloid.io/index.php">Adloid</a> is leading the charge with a platform that turns two-dimensional search and discovery into a full-fledged 3D experience, whether someone is in the market for automobiles or bikes, household furniture, consumer electronics, or personal lifestyle products.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Our AR platform gives consumers and companies personalized virtual shopping and training experiences, expanding the horizon of what AR can do for any brand or company,” said Kanav Singla, founder and CEO of Adloid. “We’re making the benefits of this technology more accessible and contextual to create an immersive experience for customers or employees on an e-commerce Website or within applications, directly from someone’s mobile device.”</p>

  <p>Unlike earlier AR tech that relied on clunky headsets with varied compatibility, Adloid’s AR platform runs on any smartphone, allowing customers to experience products at scale, in context. Once the online shopper logs in through their phone, the device’s camera scans their real-world surroundings and virtually mirrors the retailer’s or manufacturer’s product.</p>
  <p>“People can see how a new sofa or chair would fit into their home or apartment with a click of their smartphone,” said Singla. “Consumers can virtually try on jewelry, makeup, and other products. Remote workers can see if that laptop, screen, and desk configuration will fit in their home office. It’s as if the actual products are in front of you.”</p>
  <p>He added that manufacturers were interested in using the AR platform within training modules for industrial machinery service technicians, providing them with hands-on learning in a virtual setting.</p>
  <h2 id="immersive-product-discovery-experience">Immersive Product Discovery Experience</h2>
  <p>On the consumer side, AR technology is tailor-made for online shoppers who can’t get enough information about products they might purchase.</p>
  <p>“For someone trying to decide between different car models, AR lets them virtually go inside the trunk to see how much space is in there,” said Singla. “They can open and close the sunroof or try out the controls on the entertainment console, experiencing various car options before going to the showroom.”</p>
  <p>Automotive manufacturers are among the startup’s biggest customers, along with e-commerce platforms of all sizes, retailers with or without brick-and-mortar stores, and manufacturers located in the U.S., Germany, and India.</p>

  <p>Some customers using Adloid have increased sales conversions from online channels up to 200%. One online retailer tripled the number of online customers who purchased consumer items after using the tool. AR also boosts customer engagement time viewing product images and videos from an average of 30 seconds to a whopping eight minutes.</p>
  <p>“Instead of being limited by a finite number of pre-posted images or videos, AR allows people to interact longer with products in a more personalized way, creating a powerful sales channel that’s always on at the customer’s convenience,” said Singla. “People can better understand how a product would fit into their lives, in many cases motivating them to make a purchase decision during that single online session.”</p>
  <h2 id="connected-data-for-intelligent-enterprise">Connected Data for Intelligent Enterprise</h2>
  <p>Adloid securely anonymizes all customer data and doesn’t store any personal images or other information once someone ends their AR session. However, organizations can extract valuable insights from the tool’s analytics.</p>
  <p>“A car might come in six colors, but which ones are customers viewing the most? Companies can see what options people are most interested in, then connect back to inventory management to make sure they can meet market demands,” said Singla.</p>
  <p>Indeed, one of Adloid’s biggest strengths is working with the SAP Startup Studio for India, <a href="https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html">SAP Labs India’s</a> startup accelerator program. Singla said that his team gained validation for product iterations, along with access to SAP solutions, including <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, and the company’s enterprise customers.</p>
  <p>“Working with a global leader like SAP gives our product immediate credibility because we learned what customers were looking for,” he said. “Adloid is integrated with <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/e-commerce-platforms.html">SAP Commerce Cloud</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp/pricing.html">SAP S/4HANA</a>, helping companies connect data to become intelligent enterprises.</p>
  <h2 id="ar-bridges-gap-between-e-commerce-and-cx">AR Bridges Gap Between E-Commerce and CX</h2>
  <p>Singla’s entrepreneurial spirit was initially sparked by his family, all of whom own businesses. He founded his first startup at age 21 during his undergraduate studies in engineering, then saw a major selling gap as e-commerce took off.</p>
  <p>“Companies went online with their catalogs, but customers couldn’t more fully experience these products,” he said. “I launched Adloid to turn e-commerce into 3D commerce where customers can try out products virtually on their mobile device. We expect AR will provide immersive experiences in more consumer and B2B online sites including fashion, travel and tourism, and large industrial machinery.”</p>
