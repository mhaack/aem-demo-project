  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>According to a recent <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/10/92351eae-017e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP and Alpha Sense survey</a>, most businesses have not embedded sustainability into their core strategies. In some cases, corporations see sustainability management as a regulatory and compliance challenge rather than a strategic opportunity for economic and social growth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Therefore, businesses run different technologies and end up operating in silos, which prevent them from connecting financial outcomes with non-financial metrics. Additionally, companies can view sustainability as an after-the-fact reporting activity without any influence in its executive decisions.</p>
  <p>Today, more than ever, businesses need to holistically manage their business models across their supply chains, operations, and people agenda.</p>
  <p>At the recent COP26 climate conference, <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">business and government leaders agreed on the urgency</a> to reinvent their business models to accelerate sustainable business performance. Business leaders want to meet regulatory requirements, improve efficiency in their processes, and create responsible products and services.</p>
  <p>As the leading enterprise resource management company, SAP has committed to help customers in their digital transformation to make sustainability profitable and profitability sustainable.</p>
  <p>In this digital transformation, SAP’s approach is based on providing visibility and transparency to make sustainable decisions from the CEO’s office to the end user, connecting business processes to embed sustainability into all business functions — from carbon accounting to gender equality — and providing a global ecosystem of partners than can help SAP to scale impact through businesses of all sizes and across all industries around the world.</p>
  <p>Providing a global ecosystem to help businesses is core to SAP’s DNA.</p>
  <p>Julia White, chief marketing and solutions officer and member of the Executive Board at SAP SE, points out: “<a href="/">Sustainability is a team sport</a>. No company or organization can do it alone. We work with many of the world’s best companies who support our vision and work together with us every day to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers.”</p>
  <p>Working with SAP, <a href="https://www.sap.com/partner.html">partners</a> advance market development for sustainable solutions. They turn ideas and imperatives into compelling paths to action that leverage SAP solutions. Together, we advocate with thought leadership and galvanize collective efforts and methodologies in industry forums like the World Economic Forum, World Business Council on Sustainable Development, and United Nations Organizations.</p>
  <p>SAP and its ecosystem accelerate sustainable innovation as a central element of the intelligent enterprise. Through co-innovation as well as solution and content partnerships, SAP brings more complete solutions to market faster, benefiting our customers and the planet. More broadly, SAP serves as a key player in a thriving ecosystem of sustainability innovation — helping customers more easily capitalize on emerging solutions that tie closely to their digital core. With its robust network, SAP can deliver a path to sustainability innovation that no other individual competitor can match.</p>
