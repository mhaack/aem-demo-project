  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>As businesses move closer to becoming data-driven, SAP partners are helping them capture, harvest, and amplify the power of data. The content built using SAP Business Technology Platform enables them to extend their applications, business processes, and workflows with automation, artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, and more.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As data volumes increase, the creation and ingestion of that data also need to accelerate, expanding the variety of information services, automation, and analytics tools available. This has triggered a promising trend in how organizations use and share data. A <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/08/9e295602-ad7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Forrester Consulting</a> survey, commissioned on behalf of SAP, reported that two-thirds of decision-makers prioritized the integration of data and analytics platforms (65%), establishment and improvement of the use of automation technologies (67%), and engagement with external providers for data and analytics or insights services (64%).</p>
  <p>It’s welcome news that companies are starting to generate much-needed value from their business processes – supporting their recovery and growth in the face of <a href="/topics/covid-19">a global crisis</a>. But most of them are still somewhere in the middle of this transformation. In fact, Forrester Consulting reported that 48% use a point-solution approach, compared to 18% that have established a pre-integrated platform.</p>
  <p>SAP partners are helping our customers worldwide overcome this obstacle with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP). Whether a customer is just starting to develop a data valuation framework or seeking guidance to further its digital transformation, SAP partners can accelerate the journey through innovative content and services based on years of domain, project, and consulting expertise.</p>

  <h2 id="driving-transformation-with-real-life-intelligence">Driving Transformation with Real-Life Intelligence</h2>
  <p>Just like how data gains value when shared and put to good use, so do the real-world insights and services available from our partner ecosystem. And when using a unified platform of applications and services like SAP BTP, it’s clear the ecosystem of partner best practices, templates, methodologies, road maps, and adoption patterns are critical in helping our customers transform more effectively.</p>
  <p>Leveraging this partner content directly allows our customers to resolve challenges faster, uncover new opportunities proactively, mitigate risk early, and construct the system architectures to meet current and future challenges. Organizations can incorporate SAP and third-party data sources with the platform’s applications and services to address critical transformation requirements, including data management, robotic process automation (RPA), APIs, chatbots, cloud migration, process intelligence, governance, and collaboration. To help customers realize these benefits more rapidly, SAP partners can speed innovation and adoption of their content by customizing and contextualizing it through engagement models such as hackathons, coaching, and go-to-market guidance.</p>
  <h2 id="accessing-the-right-insights-anytime-anywhere">Accessing the Right Insights Anytime, Anywhere</h2>
  <p>In today’s high-tech world, it is easy to get caught up in the complexities of data extraction, transformation and enrichment, and the expertise needed to model data, machine learning algorithms, and analytics. SAP BTP offers capabilities that can package integration flows, pipelines, graphs, data models, and industry templates alike in the form of business content – tremendously simplifying these complexities regardless of the myriad of cloud, on-premise, or hybrid landscapes.</p>
  <p>For example, marketing organizations are known for receiving large volumes of data generated by various sources at an ever-accelerating pace. Like many lines of business, as they try to aggregate and consume this data, they face the risk of using distorted insights that can negatively influence decision-making and impact their ability to uncover new opportunities.</p>
  <p>Our partners help customers overcome this common challenge by harmonizing and integrating all data with ready-made connectors, delivering clean, consistent, and available information through a single location. Once stored in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/data-warehouse-cloud.html">SAP Data Warehouse Cloud</a> as part of SAP BTP, the data can then be analyzed and visualized quickly, accurately, and meaningfully in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a>.</p>
  <p>This content-driven approach to <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000059165_live_v1/Marketing%20Data%20Integration%20for%20SAP%20Data%20Warehouse%20Cloud">marketing data integration</a> automatically extracts, transforms, and loads data from company and commerce Web sites, social media, ad platforms, affiliated networks, Web and TV audience tracking systems, offline files, and other sources. Its underlying technology scales enterprise-wide to fulfill future data processing and analytics needs and automates data operations in ways that save time and resources while focusing on delivering strategic outcomes. Best of all, marketers have the visibility they need to weigh their campaign investments by measuring their contribution to overall business success.</p>

  <p>The finance function is another area that can benefit from augmenting data management capabilities with SAP BTP content and services. In one use case, SAP partner content and services help the line of business meet regulatory obligations with trusted external information – protecting the customer’s operations from the inadvertent laundering of proceeds from financial crimes or association with corrupt business practices.</p>
  <p>For example, when used within SAP Data Warehouse, the World-Check Risk Intelligence database connects <a href="https://discover.sap.com/business-accelerators/en-us/data-marketplace.html">financial and market data management</a> and analytics with the most stringent research guidelines. The database is supported by hundreds of specialist researchers and analysts across the globe who collate information from reliable and reputable sources, such as watch lists, government records, and media searches.</p>
  <h2 id="building-a-data-informed-business-culture">Building a Data-Informed Business Culture</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant advantages of data management and analytics-related content and services is time savings. As the right people get the information they need faster, it takes less time to make the right decisions to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate potentially damaging risks.</p>
  <p>Our partners can deliver on that promise with business content from <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics/features.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a>, which is available as part of SAP BTP. They have created packages to jump-start the implementation and use of the advanced analytics solution, leveraging their real-world experience with customers.</p>
  <p>Their experience and the resulting solution implementations leverage front-office content such as visualizations, key performance indicators, analytics, and digital boardrooms, as well as hidden back-office process modelling and logic. These combined sets of tools are often embedded within line-of-business workflows, mapping directly to SAP solutions. And it’s the combination that delivers the time savings and business value customers need – aligning to meet the requirements of specific departments, industries, and, in some cases, both.</p>
  <h2 id="sharing-and-thriving-with-a-collaborative-ecosystem">Sharing and Thriving with a Collaborative Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>When considering the factors that account for business growth, the power of shared experiences, industry expertise, innovation, and lessons learned are some of the most important drivers. And that is why our partners’ collective content for SAP BTP is so impactful in our customers’ transformation journey to becoming data-driven and intelligent enterprises.</p>
  <p>The pool of SAP BTP partner content, services, and intellect can offer a significant competitive advantage to customers that want to extend and amplify their applications, business processes, and workflows with the power of data and automation. It can create new possibilities to operate more effectively and efficiently through analytics, workflow triggers, artificial intelligence, and the development of new, data-driven intelligent applications. It can give organizations the peace of mind of knowing that even the most ambitious initiatives are achievable and the biggest hurdles are attainable.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>More and more, we’re living in a culture of digital innovation and experimentation – and digital process automation represents the latest domain of experimentation. For SAP partners, this is an opportunity to address every conceivable area of need – from job roles to customer experiences and business processes – with SAP Business Technology Platform.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The concept of process automation may not be new, but it’s now fueling a wide assortment of business scenarios that go beyond simple processes, tasks, and workflows. Companies are now digitalizing their operations – reaching into their vendor networks, business partners, and customers – to address organizational needs more holistically and strategically.</p>
  <p>At SAP, many of our partners are using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) to help customers take advantage of this trend to build applications that drive revenue growth. By embedding modern automation capabilities in line-of-business systems, they can improve information usability and process efficiency with automation capabilities such as verification workflows, approval processes, content integration, or the retirement of outdated materials and inventory.</p>
  <p>These examples are only a small glimpse into the automation use cases that SAP BTP can support. Through its operational layer, the platform provides a portfolio of low-code development tools and prebuilt content that can enable our partners and their customers to drive critical improvements with automation.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="setting-the-foundation-for-performance-improvement">Setting the Foundation for Performance Improvement</h2>
  <p>When first considering automation, most organizations often think about their processes. Why? To increase their operational efficiency, make better decisions, improve performance and customer satisfaction, and, better yet, allow employees to focus on more strategic work.</p>
  <p>SAP BTP supports this entry into the automation world by providing <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-process-intelligence.html">business process intelligence</a>, empowering users with a low-code and no-code platform, workflow capabilities, robotic process automation (RPA), and machine learning. Our customers can transform their business safely and predictably with proven methodologies for project and process governance and a simulation engine that evaluates the impact of change.</p>
  <p>With these capabilities, organizations can adopt a range of use cases. For example, <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/04/ce197ac4-927d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Uniper</a> has automated job requisitioning, streamlined processes for requesting and approving time off, and accelerated role authorization, registration, and authentication. In return, the energy market powerhouse realized 50% time savings on plant inspections and 10 times faster data entry for job requisitions.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, companies such as <a href="https://www.sap.com/bin/sapdxc/inm/attachment.8577/pitch-deck.pdf">Villeroy &#x26; Boch Group</a> have offloaded rule-based tasks, including the checking, classification, and processing of thousands of documents. This approach freed up employees to focus on nonroutine activities that help maximize business value and improve customer experiences.</p>
  <h2 id="cultivating-a-portal-that-unifies-work-experiences">Cultivating a Portal That Unifies Work Experiences</h2>
  <p>When using legacy workflows or out-of-date portals, maintaining a cohesive operation of multiple departments, suppliers, partners, and service providers can be difficult. But SAP BTP can help companies overcome that challenge by providing quick and intuitive mobile access to essential functions, documentation, and resources – everything a business needs to support organizational processes and strengthen information management company-wide.</p>
  <p>The platform delivers an expanding set of services that enable customers and partners to maximize the value of existing SAP applications – combining access to external data and systems through integration. Our partners can then leverage their expertise and knowledge to extend those digital assets to develop capabilities that, for example, introduce automation into complex processes and workflows and connect internal and external stakeholders.</p>
  <p>By pulling all these innovations together into a user-friendly portal, the entire business can collaborate and access information anytime and anywhere and use that intelligence to take decisive action on risks and opportunities. Administrative processes and workflows are further simplified with a streamlined user interface, while systems and data are kept secure with authentication.</p>
  <p>By adopting this use case for SAP BTP, food exporter <a href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/kM72htV.htm">SunRice</a> teamed up with SAP partner Bourne Digital Pty. Ltd. to extend existing systems and enhance its growers’ portal.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>On a journey to modernization, most companies choose to overhaul their aging legacy systems, cumbersome processes, and paper-based reporting to improve operational efficiency so they can adapt quickly to changing market conditions.</p>
  <p>One approach that many customers follow is migrating to <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA Cloud</a> and implementing the <a href="https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/42339/SAP-Workflow-Management">SAP Workflow Management</a> service and the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a> solution, all of which are part of SAP BTP. With the help of a partner, customers can embed analytics capabilities into existing business applications and establish enterprise-wide governance to help optimize the management of general ledgers, revenue, and expenses. Then, they can quickly transform their enterprise resource planning (ERP) data to automate tasks such as financial and management reporting.</p>
  <p>The benefits of system automation can quickly add up as individual process efficiencies are combined, resulting in reduced administration and reporting times, consolidation of financial results, and elimination of manual processes. Business planners can also leverage strategic dashboards generated by SAP Analytics Cloud to gain near-real-time insights into critical performance indicators. Additionally, with the inclusion of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, they can analyze scenarios, create forecasts, and predict future growth.</p>
  <p>Emulating the above path, <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/09/3c1db458-ad7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Taronga Conservation Society Australia</a> and its software partner Bluetree Pty. Ltd. automated financial and management reporting, streamlined data-driven decision-making, and delivered a superior user experience.</p>
  <h2 id="improving-the-customer-experience-from-lead-to-order">Improving the Customer Experience from Lead to Order</h2>
  <p>Automating lead-to-order processes is particularly interesting to companies that characterized their customer experiences with fast response times, little to no fulfillment errors, and inventory accuracy. Yet, even more compelling is the opportunity to enhance order visibility, efficiency, and integration from early marketing touchpoints to deal closure and beyond – accelerating customer loyalty and fueling profitable business growth.</p>
  <p>SAP customers can adopt this use-case scenario with a <a href="https://api.sap.com/package/com.ibm.bpm.ep.lto.iworkflowforleadtoorder/overview">lead-to-order intelligent workflow API package</a> – developed and maintained by one of our partners, IBM. The package spans multiple solutions such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud and the <a href="https://www.sap.com/canada/products/crm/products.html#active_tab=item_1602592296240">SAP Customer Experience portfolio</a>, which spans sales automation and configure, price, and quote (CPQ) solutions.</p>
  <p>Similar chatbot-enabled scenarios enable organizations to benefit from the automatic and rapid dissemination of relevant sales intelligence, price optimizations, and a real-time outlook into sales and pipeline performance. Furthermore, they can create lead and CPQ processes integrated with customer self-services, providing a collaborative customer experience beginning with the first interaction.</p>
  <h2 id="taking-business-intelligence-to-the-next-level">Taking Business Intelligence to the Next Level</h2>
  <p>The more companies digitally transform, the more agile, efficient, and innovative they expect to be. And of course, they see digital process automation as a critical milestone in their journey to becoming an intelligent enterprise.</p>
  <p>But this form of digitalization is much more than automating basic processes and workflows. It also expands existing systems and data and adapts them to meet new regulatory requirements, innovative business functions, emerging customer expectations, and more.</p>
  <p>By using SAP BTP as their unified and open platform for innovation, partners can help customers increase their business agility while adapting and responding to changing requirements and conditions. Furthermore, the addition of intelligent automation can boost customer satisfaction as new efficiencies are gained through the redirection of resources toward higher-value activities and the reinvention of workflows that enable a continuous stream of process improvements.</p>
  <p>Most importantly, our partners and customers are supported by the business, industry, and technical knowledge of a global ecosystem. Together, with SAP BTP and our enablement services, they can optimize the use of our back-end technology and understand our application life cycle and road map – all with a focus on shaping their unique vision of an intelligent enterprise.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>For most companies, cloud adoption represents an early milestone in their path to becoming an intelligent enterprise. Now, looking back on the last two years, we can see that it also laid the foundation for accelerated digital transformation, where years of process changes had to be squeezed into a matter of months. But instead of pure innovation, the driver behind all this change was surviving pandemic-induced disruption in market conditions, supply chains, employee work arrangements, and more.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-08-02-gartner-says-four-trends-are-shaping-the-future-of-public-cloud">Gartner</a>, public cloud spending is expected to continue to grow – consuming nearly half of all enterprise IT budgets by 2026, up from less than 17% this year. However, cloud investments will now focus more on strengthening operations, building differentiation, and improving sustainability with intelligent technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and process automation.</p>
  <p>Increased investments in the cloud will undoubtedly encompass a desire to innovate across the enterprise without being locked into a single cloud provider or set of cloud offerings. To keep options open, organizations may want to adopt a technology platform that provides open cloud services and enables them and their partners to innovate with greater control over their data, solutions, workflows, and user experiences.</p>

        <h3 id="sap-btp-accelerate-business-outcomes-with-integration-data-to-value-and-extensibility">SAP BTP: Accelerate business outcomes with integration, data to value, and extensibility</h3>

  </div>
  <h2 id="opening-up-new-possibilities-with-cloud-services">Opening Up New Possibilities with Cloud Services</h2>
  <p>Savvy decision-makers who seek to differentiate and grow their organizations must find ways to accelerate the creation and modification of business models, experiences, processes, and applications. To make that happen, they need access to the latest database and data management, analytics, integration, and extension capabilities.</p>
  <p>A unified technology platform – such as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) – works to answer that need by delivering accelerated business outcomes with integration, data and analytics, and extensibility within the context of business domains to empower business centricity. It can enable organizations to solve unique business process challenges and create more meaningful outcomes.</p>
  <p><a href="/topics/business-technology-platform">SAP BTP</a> also offers prebuilt integrations and analytics with workflows for line-of-business and industry processes to help accelerate the realization of these benefits by reducing development and innovation cycles.</p>
  <h2 id="transforming-digitally-through-connected-systems-and-prebuilt-content">Transforming Digitally Through Connected Systems and Prebuilt Content</h2>
  <p>For many organizations, adopting an open business technology platform is the key to accelerating their digital transformation journey. This journey is only possible by connecting data-driven enterprise processes, extending core business solutions, and allowing a consistent experience across different processes and workflow customizations.</p>
  <p>Take, for example, the lead-to-cash process. With a unified technology platform, businesses and their partners can design an application that creates sales contracts capable of referencing agreed pricing terms and recommending relevant promotions, incentives, and rebates. This connected, process-aware application enables sales teams to benefit from workflows that are joined across marketing, finance, supply chain, and operations.</p>
  <p>Other key components of speeding the digital transformation journey are prebuilt integrations and packaged content. For example, prepackaged contracting capabilities, configurable proposal creation rules and templates, guided self-service sales contract wizards, and adaptable approval workflows can enable lead-to-cash business stakeholders to accelerate design, development, and implementation cycles.</p>
  <h2 id="integrating-extending-and-keeping-the-core-clean">Integrating, Extending, and Keeping the Core Clean</h2>

      <div><strong><a href="https://www.sap.com/partner/become/partneredge-build.html">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The first step in this cloud-based innovation process is leveraging integration services to bridge disconnected systems, making the lead-to-cash process flexible and agile. For example, SAP customers and partners use <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/integration-suite.html">SAP Integration Suite</a>, which offers a choice of more than 1,800 prebuilt integrations, 2,100 APIs, and 160 third-party connectors to smoothly integrate on-premise and cloud-based applications and processes.</p>
  <p>By complementing these integration services with application extensions available through <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/extension-suite.html">SAP Extension Suite</a>, customers and partners can simplify application development and extend line-of-business solution capabilities. Additionally, they can quickly adapt and innovate across a heterogeneous mix of private cloud, public cloud, hyperscaler, and on-premise landscapes.</p>
  <p>These extension services enable partners to transition away from classic extensions that directly customize primary business solutions, enabling them to keep the digital core clean through side-by-side innovations that decouple their intellectual property. As a result, customers can achieve a better long-term outcome with applications that benefit from consistent upgrades to core solutions. Plus, by combining integration and extension services with prebuilt business content and native APIs, organizations can build and connect applications and data with less technical complexity – accelerating the time to results.</p>
  <h2 id="transforming-with-a-balance-of-control-and-flexibility">Transforming with a Balance of Control and Flexibility</h2>
  <p>When laying the groundwork for more stable operations and more predictive growth, nothing beats having real-time, accurate data from connected systems to make decisions confidently. And with a truly unified, business-centric technology platform, companies of all sizes and industries can turn their cloud into a high-powered innovation engine, producing better outcomes and experiences for their employees and customers.</p>

    <div>
      <div>These days, it can be so easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day and lose sight over our big-picture career goals. Where do we want to be five years from now? What kind of skills do we want to have a year from today?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>While professionals may know they want to advance, they underestimate how much <a href="https://insights.sap.com/importance-upskilling/">upskilling</a>, learning, and certification can help them along that path. A recent <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/About/News/2021/Value-of-IT-Certification-study-highlights-benefit.aspx">study</a> underscored the value of certification in career advancement, as more than 60% of participants garnered promotions following their IT certifications. Moreover, this study found intrinsic benefits to certification, including greater confidence, determination for professional success, autonomy, and job satisfaction.</p>
  <p>And it’s true: the more we invest in ourselves – by taking the time and energy to complete certifications and stay current on the latest technologies – the better we feel about the trajectory of our careers.</p>
  <p>As the SAP Learning team helps to expand the SAP ecosystem, which is <a href="/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/SAP_IG_US46867020.pdf">estimated</a> to grow the number of professionals by 60% and see partner opportunities reach $260 billion by 2024, we’ve kept this sentiment at the forefront of our commitment to creating easily discoverable and accessible upskilling opportunities for partners.</p>

  <h2 id="expanding-opportunities-for-growth-among-partners-and-individual-learners">Expanding Opportunities for Growth among Partners and Individual Learners</h2>
  <p>Along the journey to the Intelligent Enterprise, it’s critical for organizations to upskill their workforce, not only to stay competitive but to foster professional development at the individual level. SAP has long supported learning and enablement throughout the ecosystem, and with the rapid speed of innovations today, we’re providing more and more affordable, role-based learning solutions.</p>
  <p>For example, in February, we launched a new <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/01/04065f45-c97d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">learning offering specifically designed for partners</a> to advance continuous learning across the entire SAP portfolio and help partners stay up-to-date with SAP solutions. Developed with the SAP partner organization, it is designed to fit our partner’s specific business and learning needs. Since launch, it has been successfully adopted by the SAP partner ecosystem, with 30% net-new partners reached in the first six months of being live and thousands of learners currently using the offering to increase their knowledge and skills on SAP solutions and achieve certification.</p>
  <p>What’s more, for the SAP PartnerEdge program, we recently launched a private cloud version of <a href="https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/61162/SAP-Learning-Hub---Partner-Edition">SAP Learning Hub, partner edition</a> to help with increased customization and reporting functionalities.* With this <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/01/c4135f45-c97d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">private cloud version</a>, various roles in a partner organization can benefit from specific options: learners can upskill in a more private environment with company-specific learning content, while administrators can better monitor learning activities and understand the value derived from the solution.</p>

  <p>In addition to creating content to continuously build and maintain SAP skills, <a href="https://learning.sap.com/">SAP Learning</a> emphasizes validation of these skills through certification. As Nagesh Polu, SAP SuccessFactors lead consultant, YASH Technologies, noted, “<a href="https://learning.sap.com/certification">SAP Certification</a> is an important benchmark of expertise. It helps you gain key SAP knowledge and the confidence of your customers. It is a huge asset for any SAP partner.”</p>
  <p>A recent <a href="https://itcertcouncil.org/the-value-of-certification/">whitepaper</a> revealed several proven benefits of certification, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fifty-nine percent of respondents agreed certifications improved implementation of technology.</li>
    <li>More than 71% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed it has increased their ability to solve problems.</li>
    <li>Ninety-four percent of IT decision-makers globally felt that having team members with certification provides value beyond the cost of achieving the certification.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Reflecting on her certification experience, SAP Analyst Stefania Pabon said, “Without a doubt, SAP Certification has brought me a wide range of possibilities in the job market because it is generally a requirement to have SAP software knowledge.” SAP Senior Analyst Abhishek Paul echoed this view: “SAP Certification opened up a massive sea of opportunities for me. It brings a certain level of respect and is an excellent step toward securing my future.”</p>
  <p>As we make our way through the final quarter of the year and look ahead towards 2022, let’s embrace the learning opportunities in front of us for both our organizations and our own individual growth.</p>
  <p>*The private cloud version is available exclusively for SAP PartnerEdge members (excluding basic SAP PartnerEdge open ecosystem) and requires a minimum subscription of 100 users.</p>

      <div>In the competitive marketplace of enterprise technology, one designation stands above all others for having earned the trust of SAP customers seeking high quality partner solutions that successfully integrate into their SAP environments: SAP-certified status.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With more than 14,000 certifications performed, <a href="https://www.sap.com/partner/certify-my-solution/software.html">SAP Integration and Certification Center (SAP ICC)</a> is celebrating 25 years of supporting SAP partners in their mission to deliver customer success across every solution category, industry, and geography. Since the first SAP ICC locations went live in Walldorf and Palo Alto in 1996, more than 4,000 partners and independent software vendors (ISVs) worldwide have relied on SAP ICC services to help ensure the technical integration and interface of their solution with SAP.</p>
  <p>“For 25 years, the SAP Integration and Certification Center has laid the foundation for a trusted relationship between SAP, partners, and customers by certifying a high quality ecosystem of partner solutions that integrate with the latest SAP technology,” says Karl Fahrbach, chief partner officer, SAP.</p>
  <p>“As a standard-bearer for partner innovation, SAP ICC is at the forefront of partner success, supporting SAP’s strategy toward partner profitability and providing agility to customers as they become best-run businesses,” Fahrbach says. “We congratulate SAP ICC and Partner Innovation Lifecycle Services on this remarkable milestone and applaud the dedication of the SAP ICC team who remind us that at SAP partner success is customer success.”</p>

  <p>As the SAP solution portfolio has evolved over the years, SAP ICC has kept pace with innovation by rolling out the most significant certifications on time to meet market demands for the latest technologies. In 1999, SAP ICC pioneered the first cloud-based SAP ERP test system. Shortly thereafter, the SAP ICC team provided the first ABAP add-on certification in 2001, followed by a solution manager ready certification in 2007, mobile device certification in 2009, and the SAP Certified powered by SAP HANA status in 2013 – along with many others – leading up to today’s focus on partner integrations with SAP S/4HANA and partner extensions based on SAP Business Technology Platform. Each successive designation demonstrates SAP’s ongoing commitment to helping customers reduce implementation effort, accelerate innovation, and gain agility through best-of-breed partner solutions that successfully integrate into SAP.</p>
  <p>“It takes a great team to consistently deliver success for 25 long years,” says Nandagopal Prasad B, senior vice president and head of <a href="https://www.sap.com/partner/certify-my-solution.html">Partner Innovation Lifecycle Services</a>, which oversees SAP ICC in its portfolio of services, including partner co-innovation services, that enable partners to develop innovative solutions on SAP platforms and products.</p>
  <p>As the SAP ICC team has grown, it has closed the distance to customer markets not only technologically, but geographically as well by opening new locations around the world to support partners in their regions. SAP ICC is now active in 11 locations: Australia, Canada, China, CIS, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Latin America, the Middle East, and the United States.</p>
  <p>For SAP partners that have worked with the team over the years to bring new solutions to market, the 25-year anniversary of SAP ICC is a milestone marking a close working relationship of many years. “It has been a great experience working with SAP ICC colleagues,” says Samiullah Sheik, founder and managing director, Bizadept Consulting GmbH. “We worked with SAP ICC for both our product certifications, and information was provided upfront to reduce delays. SAP ICC colleagues also responded quickly whenever we faced problems during the packaging of the product. These experiences have given us more confidence to consider the possibility of going down the co-innovation path with SAP for design and development of complex products in the coming years.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvB5kqY2ZPo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvB5kqY2ZPo</a></p>
  <p>Axel Janz, global head of SAP Products and Innovations at EY, was one of the first members of the former complementary SAP Software Solution PartnerEdge program team, the predecessor of the SAP ICC, and with SAP Labs Tokyo 25 years ago. “With the SAP ICC, the EY organization has found a highly trustful, super responsive, and top-level guiding collaborator, supporting us on our integration and extension needs, accompanied by highly efficient SAP Certification processes,” he says.</p>
  <h2 id="why-partners-benefit-with-sap-certification">Why Partners Benefit with SAP Certification</h2>
  <p>Partners can gain significant benefits from having SAP-certified status, but the most compelling reason is the improved profitability that can come from lowering integration costs, accelerating go-to-market, and shortening implementation times. Once their solution has SAP-certified status, partners can place it in SAP Store to be discovered by customers alongside SAP solutions. Membership in <a href="https://www.sap.com/partner/become/partneredge-build.html">SAP PartnerEdge</a> allows partners to gain additional benefits from the program’s resources and enablement tools to help enhance partner success and profitability.</p>
  <p>To earn SAP-certified statuses, partners submit their solutions to SAP ICC for stringent qualification procedures to check that the solution uses SAP-recommended integration technologies and stable interfaces. The entire process is carried out online. While the requirements vary, the certification focuses primarily on the quality of the technical integration of the partner solution with SAP, including the smooth flow of business data through SAP. Partners are allowed access to SAP test systems as well as essential enablement and consulting services. The certification is valid for three years in most on-premise scenarios and one year in cloud integration scenarios.</p>
  <p>SAP ICC plans to celebrate its 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary with a series of regional <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/08/25/partner-meet-up-virtual-edition-25-years/">virtual partner meetups</a>, promotions via SAP social channels, and additional activities.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Analytics have been long-regarded as critical tools for uncovering growth opportunities, reducing bias in decision-making, anticipating complex market dynamics, and identifying early-stage risks. However, a significant percentage of the workforce continues to be underserved – until now.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Analytics solutions have advanced considerably over the past few years. Various options support strategic decision-making, including data visualizations, executive dashboards, predictive tools, and artificial intelligence (AI). However, most analytics still require the assistance of IT and data professionals. As a result, use of these valuable tools is often limited to executives, key decision makers, and select operational personnel.</p>
  <p>According to a <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/03/e2f05237-8e7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Forrester opportunity snapshot</a> sponsored by SAP, approximately 60% of highly desirable analytics tasks require support from IT or data professionals. This situation puts employee engagement and the delivery of targeted outcomes at risk, especially since a growing number of users demand reliable visibility into all processes and factors that influence their daily workflow.</p>
  <p>Why is this such a concern today? Organizations have too much at stake not to be truly data-driven and intelligent. Given the challenges caused by rapid market shifts, economic fluctuations, social factors, technology advancements, and climate change, they must transition to analytics solutions designed and available for everyone, not just for executives making strategic decisions.</p>

  <h2 id="the-beginning-of-the-analytics-for-everyone-era">The Beginning of the “Analytics for Everyone” Era</h2>
  <p>It’s not unusual for an employee to pull up a list of overdue accounts, an accounts receivable statement, and a sales performance view. But those capabilities are not analytics by today’s standards. Instead, they are aging glimpses into a past that will eventually become irrelevant.</p>
  <p>Today, the realm of decision-making needs to extend beyond solely reporting static operational data – evolving to include real-time, intelligent analysis of next steps and future possibilities. In fact, surveyed organizations shared with Forrester that the top benefits of augmented analytics include detecting anomalies, automating data quality, using natural language to answer questions and explain results, and identifying, predicting, and forecasting trends.</p>
  <p>With cloud-based, predictive analytics — such as the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a> solution, part of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> — many companies are empowering people of all ranks and skill sets to make decisions that lead to consequential outcomes for their business and community.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2019/07/bea49f12-597d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Bumble Bee Foods LLC</a>, for instance, has improved its brand equity with retail buyers and consumers through greater transparency and facilitated a market premium for fair-trade products. The company analyzes fish buying trends and data to identify historical performance and improve current-day catches in fishing villages together with nongovernmental organizations. This predictive approach is improving the livelihoods of local fishing communities.</p>
  <h2 id="user-potential-soars-with-embedded-analytics">User Potential Soars with Embedded Analytics</h2>
  <p>One of the most compelling capabilities of SAP Analytics Cloud is the ability to embed analytics tools directly into existing applications and drive improved business processes based on enterprise data. This design lets employees keep on top of every situation and make the right choices quickly as part of their daily workflow and interactions. And ultimately, the entire workforce moves together as one entity – knowing what the company needs and which underlying risks should be addressed, as well as when, where, and how outcomes can be realized.</p>
  <p>This advanced approach to analytics can turn everyday decision-making into a potent force for business success, while reducing the risks that organizations face in these challenging times. Nowhere is this level of transformation more evident than in companies with business models, product portfolios, operations, and supply chains designed to satisfy customer and investor preferences for environmentally and socially responsible operations.</p>
  <p><a href="/2021/07/allbirds-carbon-footprint">Allbirds Inc.</a> is a prime example of a sustainability-first business model. Holding themselves accountable to “create better things in a better way,” the shoemaker <a href="/2021/07/allbirds-carbon-footprint">labels every product with its carbon footprint</a> to inform consumers on the environmental impact of the supply chain. More impressive, this level of visibility is still happening as Allbirds experiences rapid growth, allowing it to track its inventory in real time and seek new opportunities to minimize waste.</p>
  <p>Allbirds’ success as a sustainable operation points to the power of analytics embedded in SAP S/4HANA. Recognizing that employees and business leaders do not have the time to search for relevant data or manipulate it to get what they need, users can access SAP Analytics Cloud by logging in their core applications. In return, decision makers across the company can acquire relevant insights within traditional workflows and within the same interface, take action, and move on to the next task.</p>

  <p>Another aspect of SAP Analytics Cloud that most organizations enjoy is access to pre-configured, best-practice, industry, and functional <a href="https://saphanajourney.com/sap-analytics-cloud/sac-business-content/">business content</a>. Free access to a <a href="https://saphanajourney.com/business-content-center/">library</a> of end-to-end scenarios for specific industries and lines of business lets SAP customers quickly develop their analytics systems and tailor applications with packages and templatized content from SAP and our partners.</p>
  <p>Pre-configured, best-practice offerings, content, and technical objects available through SAP Analytics Cloud help organizations jump-start their implementation and adoption of individual analytics scenarios. The open-innovation technology behind the cloud-based analytics solution and ready-to-use analytical applications and content from SAP partners can be leveraged immediately and tailored as needed.</p>
  <h2 id="multiple-tools-for-intelligent-enterprise-planning-in-one-solution">Multiple Tools for Intelligent Enterprise Planning in One Solution</h2>
  <p>SAP Analytics Cloud gives every employee real-time visibility into their business with data-driven insights. From operational reporting and predictive analytics to integrated planning and what-if analysis, the workforce can benefit from this high-performance, in-memory analytics solution under a single, engaging user experience.</p>
  <p>The cloud-based analytics solution extends a live connection to on-premise applications, replacing the need for uploading data manually to the cloud. These hybrid analytics, combined with an ecosystem of existing local solutions and new cloud applications, enables employees to discover insights and pass them along to other decision makers in context and with minimal investment and risk.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, comprehensive data management and analytics capabilities help ensure <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics/features/planning.html">enterprise planning</a> and analysis are underpinned by a consistent model of trusted information. Machine learning capabilities, for example, can be embedded in existing applications to enrich and accelerate decision-making within daily enterprise resource planning (ERP) functions. Additionally, <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/05/sac-self-service-scenario-and-what-if-analysis%e2%80%8b/">what-if analysis</a> advances decision-making to consider potential benefits and side effects before action is taken and more people are involved in the process.</p>
  <p>At SAP, our partners are playing a key role in solving customer challenges by delivering unique line-of-business and industry solutions. They are constantly developing and innovating using SAP Business Technology Platform and the SAP Analytics Cloud solution.</p>
  <p>For example, one such partner, Bourne Digital, helped Taronga Conservation Society Australia design and implement a new cloud solution using SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP Analytics Cloud. The application gave Taronga a unified digital experience for employees and streamlined business processes across its conservation research, animal welfare, and environmental education services. With greater transparency, flexibility, and scalability, the organization can now take full advantage of its data to improve operations and expand its impact.</p>
  <h2 id="designing-a-cloud-environment-with-the-customer-in-mind">Designing a Cloud Environment with the Customer in Mind</h2>
  <p>At SAP, we take great pride in enabling this new era of “analytics for everyone” and helping people of all roles and skill sets drive impactful outcomes for their business, their community, and the entire world. This mindset is what led to the development and continuous evolution of SAP Analytics Cloud.</p>
  <p>From the boardroom and office desk to a customer meeting, users can trust their business logic and formerly hidden insights can become well-advised actions that enhance corporate outcomes. More importantly, every person can be a part of the data-to-value chain – evaluating enterprise data, asking the right questions, getting real-time answers, and moving forward to help the business succeed and even improve humankind.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Today, businesses are innovating at lightning speed. To help partners seize this opportunity, SAP has launched <strong>SAP PartnerEdge Cloud Choice, flex model</strong>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The flex model offers partners a one-time 10% total contract value (TCV) commission for managing the sales cycle and increased commission for managing the customer life cycle all the way through to renewal. Additionally, SAP is expanding this revenue-share model across all market segments by introducing the one-time commission for managing the sales cycle in the large enterprise, thereby creating new opportunities for partners.</p>
  <p>Available exclusively for partners on the SAP PartnerEdge, Sell track, the flex model for SAP PartnerEdge Cloud Choice is designed to commercially balance the customer life cycle by splitting it into two different stages: sales and post-sales. Customers can choose the best partner for their specific requirements and partners can focus on garnering new accounts and driving subsequent customer engagement. With this model, partners are better equipped to offset initial costs and then invest in teams to grow the customer relationship.</p>
  <p>Implementing this flexible, balanced model can ultimately boost profitability and enrich the customer experience. Already, we’re seeing partners help yield customer success with the model, such as partner <a href="https://www.delawareconsulting.com/en-us">Delaware Consulting</a>, which has supported its customer in driving a cloud transformation through the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> offering.</p>
  <p>“SAP PartnerEdge Cloud Choice, flex model, is simple and powerful,” says Aymeric Fosset, associate partner at Delaware. “Simple, because the commission calculation and price are clearly defined upfront, allowing the partner to be rewarded for the sales cycle management effort right after the contract signature and customer payment. Powerful, because it complements the RISE with SAP offering, allowing increased financial flexibility for the customer.”</p>
  <p>This new revenue-share and go-to-market framework supports cloud adoption and is part of the growth of the broader SAP partner ecosystem in the cloud, which is expected to double over the next three years. Through emphasis on both landing customers and fostering engagement, SAP and partners have new opportunities for success now and in the future.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Disruption spurs innovation. For businesses to thrive in a rapidly changing business environment, organizations must continuously adapt by reexamining what value they can provide customers. The <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> greatly accelerated this need to transform.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This presents a unique opportunity for SAP and our partner ecosystem to guide customers through their digital transformations. Together, we help customers remain agile by managing their business processes end-to-end in the cloud. As a result of the combined value we deliver to customers, partners and SAP will generate significant cloud growth and recurring revenue.</p>
  <p>To help partners maximize this opportunity, SAP launched a new Partner Success organization, which will drive more proactive engagement from our partner experience managers. They will work with partners on their business plans and priorities. We continue to collect and act on partner feedback for our <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> offering while focusing on improving partner profitability in migrating customers to the cloud.</p>
  <p>SAP is also introducing a new commercial offer and enhancing existing offerings to help partners drive customer success in the post-pandemic business landscape. Here are some details.</p>

  <h2 id="enhancing-partner-flexibility-to-support-cloud-adoption">Enhancing Partner Flexibility to Support Cloud Adoption</h2>
  <p>At the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, SAP plans to launch <strong>SAP PartnerEdge Cloud Choice, flex model</strong>, a new revenue share and go-to-market model that provides partners more flexibility to win cloud customers and rewards partners for driving customer adoption. The flex model splits the customer life cycle into two stages, creating opportunities to better compensate partners for delivering effective sales activities <em>and</em> ongoing customer engagement. We are also improving partner cash flow by paying upfront commissions for sales activities and increasing commission rates on renewals. This new model will be available in both the large enterprise and midmarket.</p>
  <h2 id="identifying-the-right-partner-quickly-and-easily">Identifying the Right Partner, Quickly and Easily</h2>
  <p>By the third quarter of 2021, SAP will roll out a new <strong>Partner Finder</strong> to provide greater exposure for partners. This will feature a simple, intuitive, and visual search function for customers to identify the right partner for a specific business or industry without needing an in-depth knowledge of SAP technology or the ecosystem.</p>
  <p>Customers will enjoy a more seamless experience that includes the possibility for partners to provide direct links to <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/store.sap.com/dcp/en/?campaigncode=CRM-YD21-SOC-0STORPZ&#x26;source=ppc-SAPSTOREPS-GL-202121&#x26;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIm_7R9uiP8AIVmLd3Ch0Z_g8nEAAYASAAEgJ85PD_BwE__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!v_7qQHXHacqE5C74Cg_Il3rk-hqqQ50oeED2UvGqykCDyEm5VuJcTdmcHmBj_SBaAPdyCQ$">SAP Store</a> and <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sap.com/partner/find/qualified-packaged-solutions/finder.html?sort=title_asc__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!v_7qQHXHacqE5C74Cg_Il3rk-hqqQ50oeED2UvGqykCDyEm5VuJcTdmcHmBj_SB3dkzyYA$">SAP-qualified partner-packaged solutions</a>. On the main page, customers can also learn more about available SAP solutions and certified consultants and even ask the partners to be contacted, which will be a new source of demand generation for our partners. At the end of May, partners will receive an invitation to access the new partner profile editor to maintain their profile in the new Partner Finder, which they will need to complete to be visible to customers and prospects.</p>

  <p>We are likewise transforming the annual <strong>SAP Pinnacle Award</strong> program to align to our strategy and priorities for creating customer value in the cloud. We will publicly recognize those partners that have delivered superior customer value in close collaboration with SAP and provide partners with the means to market this achievement accordingly. Customers that want to work with the best of the best in the ecosystem will be able to immediately recognize the partner for unique and outstanding contributions to customer success.</p>

  <p>SAP aims to foster a best-in-class ecosystem that delivers outstanding cloud implementations to drive customer outcomes and innovation. To achieve this, SAP is investing significantly to train and educate partner consultants and developers with the most relevant and up-to-date learning content so they can develop solutions on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP).</p>
  <p>With this additional training, SAP partners will be prepared to develop industry cloud offerings, combining partner-built solutions and innovations with integration services, industry content, accelerators, and industry reference architectures. With SAP BTP as its foundation, SAP’s industry cloud helps deliver lower costs for software innovation and faster time to innovation.</p>
  <p>As more partners developing on SAP technologies, we can help customers improve their integrated end-to-end business processes and run apps and data on a unified platform.</p>
  <p>According to a <a href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/education/solutions/ind/industry_cloud/e_ep_forrester_study.html">study from Forrester Consulting</a> commissioned by SAP, partners can expect to close between 50% and 150% more deals in their first year, when compared to a similar solution, using a process model and integration technology within SAP’s industry cloud, in addition to selling bigger deals, closing deals faster, extending contract durations, and improving margins by leveraging SAP BTP.</p>
  <p>SAP is also committed to helping ensure that affordable training accompanies the release of new cloud updates and solutions. SAP is investing to help partners increase their SAP-certified consultants. In total, we aim to grow to 150,000 trained and certified SAP consultants within the SAP ecosystem by the end of 2021.</p>
  <h2 id="empowering-partner-sales-success-with-new-test-and-demo-opportunities">Empowering Partner Sales Success with New Test and Demo Opportunities</h2>
  <p>Since <a href="/2020/06/software-demonstration-environments-customer-partner-success">June 2020</a>, SAP has provided partners with free access to <a href="/2021/02/sap-lowers-cost-test-demo-environment-partners-enhances-dashboard">SAP Partner Demo Environment, shared option</a>. This integrated, pre-configured software demonstration environment expedites sales conversations. SAP is steadily expanding live demo offerings – with more than 50 live scenarios to date – to help partners position the value of the Intelligent Enterprise vision, including SAP BTP, RISE with SAP, and industry cloud.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the SAP Demo Store site has been expanded and offers partners more than 430 demo scenarios. SAP is also offering partners further price reductions for additional core cloud solutions. Since January 2021, we have offered reduced subscription fees for dedicated test, demo, and development systems of RISE with SAP, SAP Digital Supply Chain solutions, and the the database and data management and HR and people management portfolios. Reduced pricing on other cloud solutions is planned for later this year.</p>
  <h2 id="delivering-new-sap-for-me-dashboards">Delivering New SAP for Me Dashboards</h2>
  <p><a href="https://me.sap.com/">SAP for Me</a> is quickly becoming the single point of access for partners to get key actionable insights and data in a digital format. We extended the scope of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlJ3Q09DCxs">SAP for Me</a> and added new dashboards and functionalities for SAP PartnerEdge program members. This includes dynamic cards that sales professionals can use to facilitate end-to-end deal execution and that partner contacts can use to have a partner-level view of SAP certifications and partnership insights.</p>
  <p>Before the end of the year, partners will have access to additional insights, such as customer project information, a partner solutions dashboard, and cloud product adoption and renewals. This will give partners a complete overview of their customers’ information and relationship with SAP.</p>
  <p>I look forward to a gradually improving global demand in the second half of 2021 and am confident that the initiatives and opportunities we are creating for our partners will enhance the experience of both partners and customers and drive success — now and in the future.</p>

  <h3 id="q-can-you-tell-us-what-is-new-about-sap-learning-hub-partner-edition">Q: Can you tell us what is new about SAP Learning Hub, partner edition?</h3>
  <p><strong>Max Wessel:</strong> SAP Learning Hub, partner edition, is our all-new, one-stop-shop for SAP PartnerEdge program partners to develop, cultivate, and validate their SAP skills. This is the first time we’ve created an environment exclusively for partners that houses all SAP product learning content, training systems, certification opportunities, and partner-specific enablement content in an affordable, single-priced package.</p>
  <h3 id="could-you-expand-on-what-this-means-for-partners">Could you expand on what this means for partners?</h3>
  <p><strong>Karl Fahrbach</strong>: The new edition is built based on partner feedback and a key initiative within our Next-Generation Partnering efforts. We are launching this as part of SAP’s ongoing commitment to investing in and equipping partners with the relevant tools they need to drive customer success. Enabling partners with the right skills — along with providing the opportunity to validate their skills in the marketplace via our certifications — enhances our partners’ ability to deliver value to customers and to market their expertise accordingly. Furthermore, we generate trust in our ecosystem among our customers.</p>
  <p>By enhancing the learning and certification journey for our partners and by increasing the opportunity to access these resources, partners are better positioned than ever before to leverage the market opportunity available to them.</p>
  <h3 id="how-is-this-new-offering-designed-to-meet-the-needs-of-todays-partners-in-sap-partneredge">How is this new offering designed to meet the needs of today’s partners in SAP PartnerEdge?</h3>

  </div>
  <p><strong>MW:</strong> We designed this offering by listening to our partners and our customers. We heard that partners wanted a streamlined way to both train their people and help spur innovation for their customers. With one flat per-learner price, we have lowered the barriers to access, making the partner edition of SAP Learning Hub available for all SAP PartnerEdge members, regardless of size. Now, their subject matter experts can obtain and maintain the skills that their business requires across SAP solution areas.</p>
  <p>SAP Learning Hub, partner edition, combines expert-led and peer-to peer learning, hands-on practice with the latest SAP software releases and innovation, and opportunities to obtain SAP Global Certification. The content is tailored for partners’ specific goals, and where they and their customers are in their digital transformation journeys. The opportunities for certification are especially critical, as a recent <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US45796720">IDC study</a> found that organizations are better positioned to accomplish business objectives, achieve shorter deployment times, and face fewer critical issues when the professionals doing the deployment are certified.</p>
  <p>The current global <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> is accelerating an already growing trend of digital transformation, as <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/coronavirus-is-accelerating-digital-strategy-formulation">McKinsey</a> found in a recent survey, so there is an even greater need for partners to continuously update their relevant skills. As many partners in SAP PartnerEdge continue to work remotely, we have built this offering so that users can access all learning content and features wherever and whenever they learn best.</p>
  <p>Altogether, this solution meets the enablement and performance needs of partners and will continue to evolve as new SAP products, solutions, and innovations are released. With certifications in SAP’s latest technological advances via this exclusive edition of SAP Learning Hub, partners can stand out from the crowd as the preferred choice for customers.</p>
  <h3 id="why-is-it-essential-to-have-partner-specific-and-continuous-learning-content-for-sap-partners">Why is it essential to have partner-specific and continuous learning content for SAP partners?</h3>
  <p><strong>KF</strong>: Today, it is critical to keep up with the rapid pace at which innovations and new solutions regularly emerge. To remain relevant and effective, partners must keep the skills of their workforce—and recognized certifications for those skills—current. According to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/reskilling-revolution-jobs-future-skills/">World Economic Forum</a>, technology is expected to transform upwards of 1 billion jobs throughout the next decade. It is clear that having and maintaining up-to-date skills is a necessity for partners’ tool kits — not simply a nice-to-have.</p>
  <p>Enabling partners with proficiency in the most up-to-date skills and certifications that align with their specific industry and business needs also helps to further differentiate them in the marketplace and outperform the competition. As <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends/2021/workforce-trends-2020.html/?id=us:2ps:3gl:consem21:eng:cons:010721:nonem:na:F626IEQZ:1209959211:490449631679:b:RLSA_Future_of_Work:HCT21_Diving_Deeper_BMM:nb#beyond-reskilling">Deloitte’s recent report</a> on the top workforce trends driving organizations in 2021 explains, “empowering workers with agency” creates more value. When enterprises shift to a greater focus on their workforce’s learning, their teams are more equipped to “drive growth and navigate uncertainty” moving forward.</p>
  <p>By providing tailored, continuous learning opportunities through SAP Learning Hub, partner edition, our aim is to build on the existing partner engagement framework and maintain the best in class partner ecosystem that continually empowers successful customer outcomes.</p>
  <p>We’re looking forward to providing this resource to help drive success for partners and customers alike in the year ahead.</p>
