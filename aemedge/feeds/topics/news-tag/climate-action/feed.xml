      </div>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The world faces increasing climate and social crises. Comprehensive <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/">assessments</a> have given us a deeper understanding of the science and the role of industry. As a global technology company supporting the vast majority of the world’s business, SAP needs to lead from the front with our ambitions and actions. That is why SAP has committed to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2030.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Since 2009, <a href="/2021/10/integrating-climate-action-end-to-end">SAP has been on a sustainability journey</a> with the objective to create positive economic, environmental, and social impact within planetary boundaries. Along the way, we have learned a great deal about measuring economic, social, and environmental performance and integrating sustainability into our business strategy. Central to this effort has been a continuous effort to decarbonize our business. Setting ambitious targets and leveraging digital solutions have proven crucial.</p>
  <p>Raising our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions is a key element of our approach to sustainability, which looks across the interconnected areas of holistic steering and reporting, climate action, the circular economy, and social responsibility.</p>
  <h2 id="what-does-net-zero-mean">What Does Net Zero Mean?</h2>
  <p>Net zero is a state where the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere. Corporate net-zero pledges have gained significant traction as <a href="https://zerotracker.net/">half of the world’s largest companies</a>, representing an annual aggregate revenue of US$27 trillion, are committed to net zero.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="together-we-can-enable-a-future-with-zero-emissions-zero-waste-and-zero-inequality">Together, we can enable a future with zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There are <a href="https://netzeroclimate.org/what-is-net-zero-2/#:~:text=Net%20zero%20refers%20to%20a,the%20need%20for%20net%20zero.">a number of definitions of net zero</a> and how companies can achieve it. SAP follows the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-launches-world-first-net-zero-corporate-standard">Net-Zero Standard</a>, which provides a credible and independent assessment of corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science. The continually improving standard enables companies to align their climate actions with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. SAP became a member of SBTi in 2017 and was the first German company with a science-based carbon reduction target for 2050. In 2019, SAP raised its commitment and adopted a 1.5°C science-based emissions reduction target. We announced our net zero by 2030 ambition in early 2022, bringing this commitment forward by 20 years.</p>
  <p>Achieving net-zero emissions across our entire value chain means that all our emissions across all emission sources need to be either eliminated or, up to certain limits, compensated for. These emission areas, known as scopes, include those from our own operations, those generated by the energy we purchase to run operations, and finally, the largest area, external emissions such as those incurred by employee travel, items procured, and customer data center use.</p>
  <h2 id="targeting-our-entire-value-chain">Targeting Our Entire Value Chain</h2>
  <p>SAP’s net-zero plan is implemented through a comprehensive and integrated approach that involves all functions in the company, customers, suppliers, partners, and other stakeholders. We have established a cross-company program team involving experts from different lines of business to plan and implement our net-zero transformation. Reducing emissions from the use of SAP software will be the primary area for reductions, followed by purchased goods and services. The SAP net zero by 2030 approach includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accelerating the transformation of on-premise customers to the cloud through our market-leading <a href="/2023/07/rise-grow-with-sap-net-zero-journey">RISE with SAP and GROW with SAP offerings</a></li>
    <li>Enhancing direct investments in renewable energy sources and operating our internal and external data centers on 100% renewable electricity</li>
    <li>Reducing emissions by improving the energy efficiency of best-in-class data centers – our own, our co-locations, and hyperscalers – with sustainable programming and a cloud carbon footprint calculator for all SAP cloud solutions</li>
    <li>Strengthening <a href="/2023/07/sap-key-suppliers-reduce-carbon-emissions">engagement with key suppliers</a> to commit to net zero and deliver carbon-neutral products and services</li>
    <li><a href="/2021/11/sap-accelerates-move-to-emission-free-car-fleet">Electrifying the vehicle fleet</a>, promoting green mobility, and enabling hybrid work situations</li>
    <li>Compensating for emissions by investing in <a href="/2023/09/sap-funded-trees-help-reforestation-programs">high-quality, nature-based solutions</a>, such as reforestation, renewable energy, and community development, that have verified environmental and social benefits</li>
    <li>Enabling our customers and partners by adding sustainability features and functions into our core offerings, such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Ariba solutions, and SAP SuccessFactors solutions, and by giving them tools, guidance, and best practices to measure, manage, and reduce their emissions through our <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability.html">portfolio of dedicated sustainability solutions</a> including SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, SAP Sustainability Data Exchange, SAP Sustainability Control Tower, and SAP Responsible Design and Production</li>
    <li>Accurately measuring and reporting emissions using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets initiative and showing progress and performance through platforms such as CDP, EcoVadis, and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="capturing-the-opportunities-of-net-zero">Capturing the Opportunities of Net Zero</h2>
  <p>We have many achievements to build on, but we also are charting new territory. 2030 is not far away. The challenges increase the farther we move upstream and downstream into our value chain. Despite the complexities, there are enormous opportunities ahead as we establish further success with our net-zero efforts.</p>
  <p>From a business perspective, focusing on net zero means reducing risk, improving SAP’s operational efficiency, and delivering cost savings by reducing our energy consumption and waste and optimizing our processes and resources. Net-zero action helps increase our market competitiveness by creating new products and services that meet the growing expectations of customers, partners, and regulators for low-carbon and sustainable solutions. We’ll also be better at attracting and retaining top talent who are increasingly discerning about their employer’s sustainability actions. We’ll offer a compelling case to investors who used focused criteria to inform their holdings. Finally, we’ll continue to enhance <a href="/2024/01/what-industry-analysts-say-about-sap-sustainability">our reputation with industry media and analysts as a leader and innovator in sustainability</a>. And most importantly, we’ll reduce our overall carbon emissions to provide much-needed relief for the over-accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>With an increased sense of urgency, we recognize the responsibility, as well as the opportunity, to step up and drive a faster transformation toward a sustainable future. Not only must we accelerate our own net-zero transformation, but we must help other businesses and industries reinvent themselves as well. Only a fundamental transformation of our global economy will allow us to limit global warming to 1.5°C. It’s vital that we build sustainability into the very nature of how we do business.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Through the <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability.html">SAP Sustainability</a> portfolio, we envision helping our customers and partners become a network of intelligent, sustainable enterprises. We continuously work towards leading by example in our sustainable business practices and are providing products and services that help other companies meet their <a href="/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a> goals. To succeed in our efforts, it is essential to engage employees around the world, build their awareness, understanding, and sustainability action.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The Sustainability Funding Round, hosted by our Chief Sustainability Officer, Daniel Schmid, brings together SAP sustainability leaders from over 60 SAP sites worldwide to promote and finance sustainability initiatives brought forward by the SAP sustainability champions and environmental management system leads. This year’s funding round was dedicated to supporting SAP’s transition to a low-carbon, circular business and saw record-breaking participation.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="together-we-can-enable-a-future-with-zero-emissions-zero-waste-and-zero-inequality">Together, we can enable a future with zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality</h3>
        <p><em><a href="">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>More than 60 proposals were submitted from sustainability champions across the globe, including ideas on improving our physical office environment, enabling employee volunteering, and raising sustainability awareness for zero emissions and zero waste. A jury consisting of experts from Global Real Estate &#x26; Facilities (GRF), Sustainability, Global Sourcing &#x26; Procurement, SAP Corporate Social Responsibility (SAP CSR), Global Communications, and winners of last year’s funding round thoroughly evaluated all submissions. The 25 highest-rated ideas have received funding from sustainability leaders across the globe and are being implemented until the end of the year.</p>
  <p>Here is a look at some of the funding winners.</p>
  <h2 id="2tonnes-immersive-workshop-france">“2tonnes” Immersive Workshop, France</h2>
  <p>What is measured can be managed. Understanding the size of our actions and collective decisions and calling for a lead to action is a good practice. The “<a href="https://en.2tonnes.org/">2tonnes</a>” immersive workshop helps us understand our carbon footprint and how to reach two tons per person by 2050. 2tonnes is a best-of-breed carbon awareness workshop used by the French government. Around 350 SAP employees have already been trained across multiple workshops.</p>
  <p>One of the main challenges was to find like-minded people to take part in the workshops. This was mitigated with the help of leaders motivating their respective teams and adding the workshop as a part of their team activity. The aim is to continue the project in 2024 and train another 500 employees, accounting for 50% of the total number of employees in Levallois, France.</p>
  <h2 id="waterloo-and-montreal-4-trees-canada">Waterloo and Montreal 4 Trees, Canada</h2>
  <p>To foster climate action, contribute to SAP’s goal to plant 21 million trees, improve air quality, protect biodiversity, and support the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration initiative, this initiative focused on planting trees in Montreal and Waterloo, Canada.</p>
  <p>Around 130 native trees were planted in Waterloo in collaboration with Let’s Tree Wilmot, a non-profit organization part of Wilmot Horticulture Society. The project will contribute to community establishment and support reforestation efforts to reestablish a missing forest stratum or prevent erosion due to illicit trial creation. Around 75 trees and shrubs were planted in September in Montreal to enhance Mount Royal, an urban forest at the center of Montreal that is visited by more than 6 million people every year. The project will contribute to the conservation of the mountains and keep the ecosystem strong and resilient.</p>
  <h2 id="green-art-argentina">Green Art, Argentina</h2>
  <p>This project aims to use the circular economy to transform waste into a work of art to show we can add value to things considered unusable. The idea is to work with sustainable artists to create a piece of art using recycled materials that will be displayed permanently at the SAP offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
  <p>The materials will be obtained in a cleanup with employees from Buenos Aires and e-waste from our offices. The project envisions reusing waste, transforming it into art, and spreading awareness about reducing and recycling waste among employees when they take part in waste collection and when they view the art. Employees have already cleaned up a river and have gathered the necessary waste materials for the project. Creating the artwork will start as soon as the artist is onboarded as a supplier.</p>
  <p>The 2023 funding round was a tremendous success and showed that employees from all fields and locations can help lead the way towards zero emissions and zero waste.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The telecommunications business has been revolutionary in its ability to connect individuals worldwide. However, this phenomenal growth has left the sector with a significant portion of the world’s emissions. With increasing data demand, telecommunications companies must prioritize decreasing greenhouse gas emissions throughout their value chain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Scope 3 emissions from activities across suppliers, product lifecycles, and customer usage comprise the overwhelming majority of emissions for telecommunications companies. While progress has been made on scope 1 and 2 emissions, scope 3 emissions remain a blind spot that demands urgent action. Addressing scope 3 emissions is vital for telecommunications companies to meet climate goals and lead the transition to a sustainable digital future.</p>
  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/4-charts-explain-greenhouse-gas-emissions-countries-and-sectors">World Resources Institute</a>, the global telecommunications industry emitted 1.7 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in 2019, representing approximately 2% of total global emissions. Telecommunications companies have an outsized opportunity to drive change and reduce emissions given their scale and influence across global supply chains and billions of customers worldwide.</p>
  <p>Now is the time for telecommunications companies to step up with courageous leadership, collective action across the ecosystem, transparency, and a laser focus on reducing scope 3 emissions.</p>
  <h2 id="understanding-scope-3-emissions-in-telecommunications">Understanding Scope 3 Emissions in Telecommunications</h2>
  <p>Scope 3 emissions encompass the vast majority of emissions across the telecommunications value chain. Key sources include:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Supply chain</strong><br>Manufacturing, transport, and disposal of network equipment makes up the largest share, such as 60% of Verizon’s total scope 3</p>
  <p><strong>Product usage</strong><br>Energy consumption of infrastructure, data centers, and devices</p>
  <p><strong>Customers</strong><br>Emissions from using products and services represent over 20% for leading telecommunications companies</p>
  <p>While methodologies vary, standards like the <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol</a> enable consistent and transparent scope 3 accounting. Robust data collection and industry alignment will enhance accuracy over time. The urgency of climate action necessitates that telecommunications companies act now to address primary scope 3 hotspots like supply chain and product usage.</p>
  <p>Success requires transparency, cooperation, and immediate commitment to tackle scope 3 emission sources.</p>
  <h2 id="challenges-in-calculating-scope-3-emissions-in-the-telecommunications-industry">Challenges in Calculating Scope 3 Emissions in the Telecommunications Industry</h2>
  <p>Calculating scope 3 emissions poses major challenges for telecommunications companies, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data limitations</strong>: Telecommunications companies lack visibility into supplier and vendor emissions. Greater transparency and coordination are essential.</li>
    <li><strong>Complex value chains</strong>: Varied reporting mechanisms across the vast partner ecosystem create aggregation difficulties.</li>
    <li><strong>Methodology alignment</strong>: Companies must determine boundaries and allocate shared infrastructure emissions while adhering to accounting standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Rapid technology changes</strong>: Emerging solutions like 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT) require continuous emissions monitoring.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Robust data collection, industry collaboration, and transparency will be vital to overcome these obstacles. Standardized methodologies guided by established protocols will enhance accuracy over time.</p>
  <p>Above all, open cooperation across telecommunications value chains is crucial to drive scope 3 progress. From suppliers to customers, aligning stakeholders to prioritize emissions reductions will accelerate the sustainability shift, despite near-term uncertainty. Telecommunications companies have the scale and influence to lead the way.</p>
  <h2 id="strategies-for-mitigating-scope-3-emissions">Strategies for Mitigating Scope 3 Emissions</h2>
  <p>Telecommunications companies can mitigate scope 3 emissions through:</p>
  <p><strong>Supplier collaboration</strong><br>Joint research and development (R&#x26;D), audits, and incentive programs enable partners to reduce their supply chain footprint. AT&#x26;T uses a sustainability scorecard to motivate action.</p>
  <p><strong>Renewable energy</strong><br>Shifting infrastructure and operations to clean power significantly decreases emissions. BT Group and Telefónica aim for 100% renewable electricity use.</p>
  <p><strong>Eco-design</strong><br>Prioritizing recyclable and energy-efficient materials and manufacturing reduces lifecycle impacts. Vodafone’s Eco Rating drives more sustainable devices.</p>

  <p><strong>Customer engagement</strong><br>Awareness campaigns, energy-saving tips, and green tariffs incentivize sustainable usage. Orange’s set-top box eco-rating nudges consumers.</p>
  <p><strong>Policy and regulation</strong><br>Scope 3 requirements in markets like the EU also drive telecommunications companies to address value chain emissions through mandated reporting and carbon pricing.</p>
  <p>Additionally, telecommunications companies can further engage customers through expanded recycling and take-back programs to optimize device lifecycles. Services like leasing instead of selling phones can incentivize longevity. Features that track energy consumption also enable users to reduce their footprint.</p>
  <p>There are still challenges, but collective effort across the telecommunications ecosystem can drive progress on scope 3 emissions. Engagement and incentives can accelerate emissions reductions across value chains from suppliers to customers. With their global scale, telecommunications companies must lead the way.</p>
  <h2 id="calculating-and-reporting">Calculating and Reporting</h2>
  <p>To enable accurate and consistent scope 3 accounting, telecommunications companies should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adopt recognized standards like the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard, which provides comprehensive guidance.</li>
    <li>Improve supplier data collection through surveys and supplier engagement platforms.</li>
    <li>Increase transparency by regularly disclosing scope 3 inventories and strategies in sustainability reports.</li>
    <li>Obtain third-party verification for scope 3 emissions data to ensure reliability.</li>
    <li>Collaborate with industry peers and partners to align methodologies and reporting.</li>
    <li>Continuously refine calculations by incorporating improved data sources and emission factors.</li>
    <li>Supplement inventory accounting with scenario modeling to project future emissions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While uncertainties remain, standardized and transparent scope 3 reporting is vital to understand emissions baselines, track progress over time, and hold companies accountable. Investors and customers are increasingly demanding credible disclosure.</p>
  <p>Telecommunications companies should lead the drive towards robust scope 3 accounting and reporting across sectors. Their commitment can catalyze broader adoption of carbon transparency.</p>
  <p>Using SAP Sustainability Data Exchange, telecommunications companies can collaborate with partners, enhance awareness and engagement of stakeholders, gain insights, mitigate risks, and seize opportunities to reduce and offset emissions.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, courageous leadership and collective diligence across telecommunications company value chains are imperative to drive progress. Telecommunications companies have the influence to spearhead robust and transparent scope 3 practices across all sectors. But, success hinges on prioritizing partnerships, integrity, and environmental stewardship above all. The moment for action has come.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Back in 2010, Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that the <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us">Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)</a> is to the <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us/20th-anniversary">future of business what the X-ray was to the future of medicine</a> – without it, doctors could never see the inside of a patient’s health. Exactly this kind of laser-like transparency is needed to move the needle regarding the health of the planet, which incidentally contributes massively to the health of the economy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>CDP was founded at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street">10 Downing Street</a> 20 years ago in response to a warning by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/about/">IPCC scientists</a> that if climate change remained unchecked, the world would warm by six degrees Celsius within the century. As the number of climate-related catastrophes mounted over the years, CDP kept urging companies and governments to report on their emissions and take measurable action.</p>

  <p>Today, the world’s economy looks to <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/companies/companies-scores#1ea1731978553db35dcd1469b155011d">CDP as the gold standard</a> of environmental reporting with the richest and most comprehensive data set on corporate and city action. By scoring companies and other organizations from D to A on climate change, forests, and water security, CDP helps them evolve from disclosing sustainability metrics to taking measurable actions that lead to environmental leadership.</p>
  <p>In light of the recent <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">climate conference COP26</a>, it is apparent more than ever that the private sector has a critical role in driving change and leading by example. SAP enforced its climate action commitment by moving its <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">carbon neutral target up</a> by two years to 2023. This week, SAP received a spot on the prestigious <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/scores">CDP A list</a>, which announces over 300 companies leading the way to a <a href="/">more sustainable future</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/cdp-reports-record-number-of-disclosures-and-unveils-new-strategy-to-help-further-tackle-climate-and-ecological-emergency">2021 was a record year</a>. More than 13,000 companies reported on their environmental impact through CDP, despite the continuing challenges of <a href="/covid-19">the pandemic</a>. This was 37% more than 2020 and 135% higher than when governments signed the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015. Between them, disclosing companies in 2021 accounted for over 64% of global market capitalization, including 96% of the FTSE 100, over 80% of the S&#x26;P 500, and more than 1,500 companies in China.</p>
  <p>SAP’s CDP A rating comes only weeks after SAP was named the software industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for the 15th consecutive year, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/esg/scores/?utm_source=email&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_campaign=YB21_member">identifying</a> SAP as an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) front-runner.</p>

  <p>Achieving top scores in the CDP and DJSI rankings sets SAP apart as exemplar when it comes to disclosure. More importantly, SAP solutions for sustainability help companies measure and monitor their emissions, making it an enabler for companies that want to do due diligence on their own performance.</p>
  <p>“The DJSI and CDP awards recognize Fortune 500 companies that are taking concrete steps to tackle climate change challenges. It is good to receive ongoing independent recognition that SAP is on the right track,” said Daniel Schmid, chief sustainability officer at SAP, responsible for SAP’s sustainability efforts. “It’s equally important to embed sustainability in the business strategy, so that it impacts all aspects of the business. That’s how we can reduce the negative impact on our environment and create regenerative business.”</p>
  <p>SAP customers benefit from a range of products to help them to take climate action or to accelerate their participation in the circular, wasteless economy.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/product-footprint-management.html">SAP Product Footprint Management solution</a> enables organizations to combat climate change by capturing the environmental footprint of products across the value chain so they can build sustainability into the fabric of how they do business. Last month, SAP added <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a> to its portfolio. The solution helps companies gain better visibility of material flows through their processes including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations, especially those concerning product packaging and plastics.</p>
  <p>And finally, <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2021/06/10e155de-e87d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP Sustainability Control Tower</a> helps customers meet their ESG performance targets. This solution enables integration of top-line and bottom-line management with an added dimension – a green line for integrated environmental and social sustainability insights and decision-making.</p>
  <p>The importance of disclosure cannot be underestimated. Business is still business, but in today’s challenging world, the purpose is not to just turn a profit; it’s to remain competitive, relevant, and sustainable while turning a profit. While the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2021/10/21/seeing-beyond-the-sustainability-blind-spot-can-lead-to-long-term-growth/?sh=42b874502f2e">balance sheet may not always show it yet</a>, sustainability is already material to all companies because the fortunes of business are inevitably linked to those of the planet.</p>
  <p><a href="https://insights.sap.com/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness/">A recent survey by SAP Insights</a> found that the more companies believe sustainability is material to their businesses, meaning it is likely to affect their financial condition and should be publicly disclosed, the more competitive and profitable they are likely to be.</p>
  <p>The good news is that after 20 years of running the world’s environmental disclosure system for companies, cities, and regions, CDP finally <a href="https://vimeo.com/239499952">sees a tipping point</a>. With companies disclosing and reporting more than ever before, it’s becoming easier to accelerate change, especially with the right tools and technology at hand.</p>

  <p>By 2050, according to <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/green-hydrogen/report.pdf">research by Goldman Sachs</a>, green hydrogen could supply up to 25% of the world’s energy needs and become a €13 trillion (US$15 trillion) market. But until we get there, current challenges of storing and transporting hydrogen need to be overcome first.</p>

  <h2 id="not-all-hydrogen-is-created-equal">Not All Hydrogen Is Created Equal</h2>
  <p>In the long run, only CO2-free hydrogen produced with the help of renewable energies is sustainable. However, it will be quite a while before there is enough green hydrogen to meet the growing demand. The reason: there is not enough green electricity. Of the many alternative production methods, the most popular today is blue or grey hydrogen produced from natural gas.</p>
  <p>In the future, many industrial processes will use green or blue hydrogen or downstream products made from it, such as ammonia and methanol. Hydrogen can particularly help clean up emission-intensive industries like transportation, chemical iron, and steel production, which account for about 7% of global CO2 emissions each year. But the high number of potential users contrasts with the limited availability and high production costs of hydrogen.</p>

  <p>In line with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en">European Green Deal</a> to reduce emissions at least 55% by 2030 and make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, governments have adopted similar sustainability goals and consider hydrogen a critical component to reach them. <a href="/2021/05/net-zero-emissions-transformation-journey">Companies are also taking action</a> to support green and digital transformations in the EU. For instance, the <a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/about-us/newsroom/news/press-releases/european-ceo-alliance-emphasizes-cross-industry-collaboration-to-fight-climate-change-5f771e77ccf05b586c3f6508">European CEO Alliance</a> was founded by 12 executives from leading European companies to develop concrete recommendations for action and help companies undergo the green transition. This alliance is driven by the conviction that no company will solve the greatest challenges of our time alone. To succeed, companies need to collaborate across value chains, build partnerships, and work together with governments and academia.</p>
  <p>One project that has emerged from these cross-company efforts is looking at how to accelerate the complete value chain of green hydrogen – from production, transport, storage, and sale, to the energy customer. Instead of operating in silos, these market segments need to be linked together.</p>
  <h2 id="a-data-sharing-platform-as-the-single-source-of-truth">A Data-Sharing Platform as the Single Source of Truth</h2>
  <p>The first prototype of a green hydrogen platform based on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a> looks promising. The platform combines data from all participants of the hydrogen value chain and, therefore, enables better data-driven business decisions. Instead of managing complicated spreadsheets, an energy provider can use the platform as their single source of truth to run simulations and calculate how much energy they can produce, how much they want to sell to the electrolyzer, and how much power they need for vehicles, households, and industries.</p>
  <p>For such platforms to be successful, visibility across the value chain of green hydrogen is a prerequisite. Supply chain solution <a href="https://www.green-token.io/">GreenToken by SAP</a> helps companies to track hydrogen across the entire supply chain, from production to energy customer, via electrolyzers and carriers using blockchain technology. The solution is designed to provide auditable proof of what percentage of the hydrogen is green, blue, or grey. GreenToken can also be used to track <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#:~:text=3%20Emission%20Factors-,Description%20of%20Scope%203%20Emissions,impacts%20in%20its%20value%20chain.&#x26;text=Scope%203%20emission%20sources%20include,downstream%20of%20the%20organization%27s%20activities.">scope 3 CO2 emissions</a> that are caused when hydrogen is imported from far away. Companies can leverage the data to prove that their purchased hydrogen is truly green. They can also see how much CO2 has been created during the journey from production origin to customer site and, therefore, how much they would need to offset to make the hydrogen 100% green again.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>As part of its long-standing and ongoing commitment to sustainability, SAP has joined the <a href="https://leafcoalition.org/">LEAF Coalition</a> (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance) in support of the fight against climate change. The announcement came during the World Leaders Summit on November 2, 2021, part of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (<a href="https://ukcop26.org/">COP26</a>).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP is <a href="/topics/cop26">an active participant</a> in the conference, which brings together government and business leaders, international organizations, and other stakeholders in a common cause to accelerate action toward combatting climate change.</p>
  <p>LEAF is a voluntary global coalition made up of private-sector businesses and governments to provide finance for tropical and subtropical forest conservation. With US$1 billion mobilized already, LEAF is on track to become one of the largest ever public-private efforts to protect tropical forests. SAP will contribute $2.2 million to the LEAF Coalition as it works to reverse deforestation in vulnerable areas and help achieve the goals of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement">Paris Agreement</a> to combat climate change. As natural carbon sinks and biodiversity treasures, forests are essential for all life on earth and play an important role in mitigating global temperature rise.</p>
  <p>“We are committed to being part of the solution to climate change,” says Luka Mucic, CFO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “As we accelerate our transformation to be a net-zero company, we continually look for ways to avoid, reduce, and, if needed, compensate emissions. No company or country alone, however, will turn the tide on climate change. So, it is also our priority to collaborate. That’s why we’re excited to join forces and accelerate action as part of the LEAF Coalition. We’re confident that our investment will support nature-based solutions benefitting the environment, biodiversity, and local communities.”</p>
  <p>SAP strives to be a leading example of sustainable business practices – its financial support of LEAF is just one part of the company’s holistic efforts to fight climate change and restore ecosystems. Since 2009 SAP has aggressively pursued cuts to its own business carbon footprint with a goal of being <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">carbon neutral by the end of 2023</a> while in parallel continuing its efforts to meet a science-based target to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In addition to LEAF, SAP also supports the <a href="https://www.1t.org/">1t.org</a> initiative to conserve, restore, and grow one trillion trees by 2030. The <a href="https://www.1t.org/pledges/climate-action-and-21-million-trees-by-2025">company pledges</a> to plant 21 million trees by the end of 2025 while continuing to drive carbon-reducing innovations and pursue a science-based climate target. SAP’s efforts also include active participation in a variety of <a href="/2021/07/enhancing-sustainability-people-technology-21-million-trees">other funds and initiatives</a>.</p>
  <p>And, as a leading provider in enterprise application software, SAP is also uniquely qualified to help customers optimize their sustainability performance not only in their own company but across their entire value chain. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability.html">SAP technology</a> helps organizations measure and understand their efforts relating to climate protection, diversity and inclusion, ethical responsibility, and more.</p>
  <p>“Sustainability directly links to SAP’s purpose of helping the world run better and improving people’s lives,” says SAP Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Schmid. “This means creating positive economic, environmental, and social impact. To live up to this ambition, SAP provides customers with products and services that help meet their sustainability opportunities and challenges. We also lead by example and strive to be a role model for sustainable operations and investments.”</p>
  <p>In recognition of its efforts to drive innovation and action toward the creation of genuinely sustainable markets, SAP was <a href="/2021/11/sap-awarded-terra-carta-seal">recently awarded the Terra Carta Seal</a>. The seal is awarded to companies whose ambitions are aligned with those of the Terra Carta, a recovery plan for Nature, People, and Planet, by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.</p>

      <div>I am a proud dad of two young kids. Since they were born, the world has experienced a global <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>, increasing social unrest, numerous political conflicts, and countless natural disasters from heat waves and wildfires to record flooding.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Oftentimes, when we talk about sustainability, we think about it in terms of the distant future. But looking at the past few years alone, it becomes clear that we don’t need solutions in, say, five years. We need them now.</p>
  <p>It’s not about what we are doing to make the world better by the time our children are grown up, but about what can we do to make things better right now. What are we doing to make an impact by the time they learn to ride a bike, have their first day in kindergarten, leave school, and enter their first job?</p>
  <p><strong>We need to act now to ensure that our children have a sustainable future.</strong></p>
  <p>We might think that our individual actions don’t matter. But changes – both big and small –in the way we live our lives can help reduce our own personal carbon footprint, and also encourage other individuals, businesses, and policy makers to act for the good of the planet. Because at the end of the day, everything counts. Every day we act, every step we take, every decision we make can help move the needle. And vice versa: Every step we don’t take today will take us three steps back in the future.</p>
  <p>Today is <a href="/2021/07/earth-overshoot-day-2021">Earth Overshoot Day 2021</a>. It marks the date when humanity has exhausted nature’s budget for the year. From this day forward, we are using an unsustainable amount of the world’s resources. The exact date each year is calculated based on 3 million statistical data points from 200 countries, and the team at Global Footprint Network <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/about-earth-overshoot-day/">explains the process here</a> in more detail.</p>
  <p>This year’s date is almost as early as in 2019, when it fell on July 26, after being momentarily pushed back in 2020 by lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic. So for more than 40 years, we have been using up our planet’s resources in excess. Our desire for every aspect of our lives to become better, faster, and newer is not only stealing from a planet that cannot keep up with the demands of almost 8 billion people, but also costing our future generations an Earth on which they can live and prosper.</p>

  <p>The graphic above shows what is possible in extreme situations such as with the numerous lockdowns and restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <p>Just a few examples: Due to beach closures in Florida, female turtles laid more eggs. In Japan — one of my favorite countries to visit — the Nara deer left the park to find food because the tourists that would normally feed them were no longer there. Air and water quality improved as tourism ground to a halt. For the first time in 30 years, Indians in the city of Jalandhar and the surrounding area could see the Himalayas.</p>
  <p>These examples show that our planet could recover relatively quickly if given the chance. However, life in many parts of the world is returning to a new version of normal with more and more people receiving vaccinations. While this is good for humanity, it also has an impact on nature.</p>

  <p>The private sector for sure has its part to play if we are to combat climate change. Businesses should not focus exclusively on profit maximization, but at turning things around, in the here and now, for current and future generations.</p>
  <p>Without any doubt, sustainability is about more than protecting our environment. It is about ensuring the balance between economic growth, environmental care, and social welfare. That said, carbon neutrality is a major driver and key indicator of sustainability.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we set our goal to become carbon-neutral in our own operations by the end of 2023, two years earlier than previously stated. The SAP approach is of first avoiding, second reducing, and third compensating for emissions. You can read more about <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">our goal for 2023 here</a>.</p>
  <p>But in addition to pursuing our own targets, we also want to help our customers become more sustainable. Because we are convinced: It’s time to build sustainability into the fabric of how we do business. We need to make it a standard dimension of corporate management just like productivity or growth.</p>
  <p>We’ve <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability.html">developed various solutions</a> to help businesses embed operational, experiential, and financial data and insights to drive sustainability at scale. With our sustainability portfolio, we support companies on their entire journey across the full spectrum of sustainability – from carbon neutrality to social impact and economic progress.</p>
  <p>Additionally, we will drive multi-year innovation roadmaps to ultimately provide our customers with end-to-end visibility around sustainability, integrated into their core business processes. To get to our vision of <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/purpose-and-sustainability.html">Chasing Zero</a>, we must act now with the goal of zero waste, zero emissions, and zero inequality.</p>
  <p>Given the significance of global supply chains in tackling sustainability, the SAP community truly has the power to protect our planet and create a future our children want to be part of. So, let’s give our planet the chance to recover and #MoveTheDate together.</p>

      <div><em>“In less than eight months, humanity has exhausted Earth’s budget for the year.”</em> I was concerned to read this on the <a href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/earth-overshoot-day/">Global Footprint Network’s homepage</a> few weeks ago, when the global Earth Overshoot Day 2021 was <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/">announced to land on July 29</a>. This means that for the rest of the year, we are running on a deficit: our demand for ecological resources and services is exceeding what Earth can regenerate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>What unsettles me most is that we have completely re-bounced to the pre-pandemic overshoot. When I was <a href="/2020/08/earth-overshoot-day-moving-back-on-budget">reflecting on Earth Overshoot Day on August 22 last year</a>, I was hopeful that we had turned around the <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/newsroom/past-earth-overshoot-days/">devastating trend</a> of reaching our planet’s natural limits earlier and earlier since 1970. It had been the first time in years that we had pushed Earth Overshoot Day to a later date. But now we have almost returned to the level of 2019, with an <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/2021-calculation/">estimated 6.6% increase of our global ecological footprint in 2021</a> compared to 2020.</p>
  <p>Have we not learned our lessons? Are we not managing to leverage the small window of opportunity to ensure a sustainable recovery?</p>
  <p>The conversation around sustainability did actually accelerate in the last 18 months, quite drastically even. Political will has been converging with true economic business cases. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dishashetty/2021/03/24/a-fifth-of-worlds-largest-companies-committed-to-net-zero-target/?sh=62cc3a83662f">Ambitious sustainability commitments were abundantly announced</a>. For businesses it is no longer a question of “if,” but of “how” and “how fast” — and the latter seem to be the issue. The many bold targets from diversity to net-zero remain to be executed.</p>
  <p>It’s clear that we need to move from goal setting to action and do so faster.</p>
  <p>Being a stubborn optimist, I never give up taking note of examples that prove progress in the right direction. I was intrigued when reading about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/amsterdam-brussels-bet-on-doughnut-economics-amid-covid-crisis.html">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/news/10">Brussels</a> being among the first cities to implement Doughnut Economics amid the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> crisis. The model was introduced by <a href="https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/">economist Kate Raworth, who describes it as follows</a>:</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div>Humanity’s 21st century challenge is to meet the needs of all within the means of the planet. In other words, to ensure that no one falls short on life’s essential needs (from food and housing to health care and political voice), while ensuring that collectively we do not overshoot our pressure on Earth’s life-supporting systems, on which we fundamentally depend. The Doughnut of social and planetary boundaries is a playfully serious approach to framing that challenge, and it acts as a compass for human progress this century.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Having been inspired by Raworth’s doughnut, as well as by related frameworks such as Johan Rockström’s concept of the <a href="https://stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html">planetary boundaries</a>, we have also evolved SAP’s objective over time to “creating positive economic, social, and environmental impact within the planetary boundaries.” We know it’s still directional, but are passionately working together with our employees, partners, suppliers, governments, and NGOs toward bringing this to life.</p>

  <p>At our first <a href="https://vshow.on24.com/vshow/SustainabilitySummit/#exhibits/L1">SAP Sustainability Summit</a> in April this year, we heard inspiring examples of how this has already been put into practice along with future solutions yet to be implemented. While the focus was on holistic steering and reporting, climate action,and circular economy, it is the circular economy that especially comes to mind today.</p>
  <p>Earth Overshoot Day painfully visualizes that our current economy is largely based on a “take-make-waste” model — the linear economy, or as Raworth puts it so vividly the “industrial caterpillar, ingesting food at one end, chewing it through, and excreting the waste out of the other end.” The key is to move away from this degenerative approach toward a regenerative one based on continual (re)use of resources in a closed-loop system, minimized use of resource inputs, and reduction of waste, pollution, and carbon emissions. This only works through collaboration across networks, which is a key motivation for SAP to <a href="/2021/06/sapphire-now-business-network-sustainable-performance">create new business communities</a> able to improve business outcomes, better navigate changing economic and geopolitical conditions, and enhance sustainability contributions.</p>
  <p>The experiences, advancements, and challenges shared during the SAP Sustainability Summit by both large corporations — including Mitsubishi, adidas, H&#x26;M, Nestle, Dow, Eastman, Audi, and BASF — as well as startups such as Queen of Raw, Topolytics, Rheaply, Greentoken, and Re-loop, make me hopeful that we have the foundation on which to build. Partnerships that were equally discussed at the event — as with Accenture, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, or the World Economic Forum’s Global Plastics Action Partnership — should provide the springboard to accelerate and scale.</p>
  <p>SAP is committed to play its part in driving the transition toward an <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/purpose-and-sustainability/economy.html">inclusive, circular, and zero-waste economy</a> — be it through the <a href="/2021/06/sapphire-now-sustainability-management-by-sap">launch of new sustainability solutions</a>, supporting alliances and pledges like the WWF’s OneSource <a href="https://www.onesourcecoalition.org/">coalition</a> and Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s <a href="https://plastics.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/epr">Call to Action</a> encouraging government actions against plastic wast,e or by offering a <a href="https://open.sap.com/courses/ce1">free online course</a> to increase the awareness of benefits and best practices.</p>
  <p>I invite everyone to join in and act now. The Global Footprint Network has a <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/portfolio/i-join-the-solutions-to-movethedate-movement/">#MoveTheDate movement</a> to chip away at our own ecological footprint, both collectively and individually. Let’s make it happen together!</p>
