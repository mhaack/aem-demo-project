We are confident about the company’s prospects in 2024. From this position of strength, SAP is opening the next chapter: with the planned transformation program, we are intensifying the shift of investments to strategic growth areas, above all Business AI. Going forward, this will empower us to keep leading with innovation while increasing the scalability of the operating model.</div>

        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced updates to its reporting and receivables financing practices, which will become effective January 1, 2024.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The updates mainly include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The inclusion of share-based compensation (SBC) expenses in non-IFRS results,</li>
    <li>The exclusion of gains/losses from equity investments, mainly driven by SAPPHIRE Ventures, from non-IFRS results,</li>
    <li>The general shift of gains/losses even on smaller divestitures to non-operating income/expense,</li>
    <li>The discontinuation of the company’s receivables financing program (“SAP triggered financing”).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The updates will be reflected for the first time in SAP’s Q1 2024 results, which will be reported on April 22, 2024. While the updates will not impact Q4/FY 2023 results, which will be reported January 24, they will be reflected in SAP’s outlook for 2024 as well as potential updates to its Financial Ambition 2025.</p>
  <p>“By implementing these updates, we hope to further increase the transparency of our operating results, while at the same time reducing short-term noise and volatility,“ said Dominik Asam, CFO and member of the Executive Board of SAP. “Including share-based compensation in our adjusted earnings may be interpreted as a disadvantage in comparison with some of our peers. But we believe recognizing share-based compensation as a genuine expense of running a business is long overdue. We are also convinced that appropriately reflecting it in steering and the incentivization of management will ultimately add economic value.”</p>
  <p>Reflecting the company’s increasing focus on cross- and upselling its broader cloud solution portfolio, SAP also announced its intent to replace the current “SAP S/4HANA Cloud” revenue and current cloud backlog disclosure with a more broadly defined “Cloud ERP Suite” revenue disclosure in 2024.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Jennifer Li and Dr. Qi Lu Announced for Re-Election as Shareholder Representatives</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong> — The Supervisory Board of <a href="http://www.sap.com">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) has nominated Mr. Punit Renjen to stand for election as a new member of the Supervisory Board and proposes Mr. Renjen as the designated successor to Chairman, Prof. Dr. Hasso Plattner.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With this decision, Prof. Dr. Plattner and the Supervisory Board initiate the succession process. The next step is Mr. Renjen’s candidacy for the Supervisory Board, which the shareholders will decide upon at the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2023. Upon election to the SAP Supervisory Board, the handover process by Prof. Dr. Hasso Plattner to Punit Renjen would begin. Prof. Dr. Plattner’s term expires in May 2024.</p>
  <p>With an impeccable track record, Punit Renjen is highly qualified to join the Supervisory Board and would be an excellent candidate to eventually take the chair at a time when SAP is undergoing the most fundamental strategic transformation in its 50-year history. Mr. Renjen brings valuable strategic insights and knowledge of what businesses need in today’s fast-changing environment. He has an intimate understanding of global customer requirements and SAP’s ability to help them sustainably transform and grow.</p>
  <p>Prof. Dr. Hasso Plattner (79), who co-founded SAP in 1972 – together with Dietmar Hopp, Claus Wellenreuther, Klaus Tschira, and Hans-Werner Hector – and has served as Chairman since 2003, said:</p>
  <p>“We are excited to propose Punit Renjen as a new member of the SAP Supervisory Board for a four-year term at the AGM in May 2023. This initiates a structured transition at the helm of the Supervisory Board, ensuring the continuity necessary for our company’s ongoing growth. With extensive experience as a highly successful CEO of one of the world’s largest consulting firms, Punit brings valuable insights and expertise to the board. His deep understanding of our customers’ needs, and the broader industry make him an ideal candidate for Chairman of the Supervisory Board from 2024 onwards. While we are now the number one Enterprise Application company globally, I will continue to chair SAP with passion and commitment until the baton is passed to the new leader who will take the company to new heights. As an investor with an unchanged stake, I will remain committed to SAP and its mission to help the world run better and improve people’s lives. We are also pleased to put forward Jennifer Li and Qi Lu for re-election as Supervisory Board members. Their diverse backgrounds and expertise will continue to be invaluable, as we work alongside the Executive Board to navigate the opportunities and challenges ahead and drive our growth and innovation agenda.”</p>
  <p>Punit Renjen (61) served as Deloitte Global CEO from 2015 until his retirement on December 31, 2022. As Global CEO, Mr. Renjen developed and executed a strategy that resulted in Deloitte revenues growing from $35 billion to more than $59 billion in just seven years. Today, Deloitte is the leading professional services organization in the world and one of the world’s best places to work. Deloitte employs 415,000 people in 150 countries. Deloitte also has a thriving partner ecosystem, of which SAP has been part of for over 30 years.</p>
  <p>“I am very pleased to be considered for a role at SAP – an iconic company with a key role in the global economy. At a time when the company is successfully transforming into an enterprise application leader in the cloud and delivering on Hasso Plattner’s original vision of helping the world run better and improving people’s lives, I could not be more excited at the opportunity to help shape the future of a company that has unmatched relevance for global business. I am looking forward to working with talented colleagues around the world to ensure the company continues to help its customers solve their most pressing problems,” said Punit Renjen.</p>
  <p>Mr. Renjen is a member of the Leadership Council of the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the International Business Council. In 2022, he was recognized by the Economic Times as the “Global Indian of the Year” and by the Carnegie Corporation of America as a “Great Immigrant. Great American”. In 2021, he was awarded the Oregon History Medal. Previously, he served as Chairman of the United Way Worldwide. Born and raised in India, Mr. Renjen moved to the United States on a Rotary Foundation Scholarship to attend Willamette University and graduated with a master’s degree in management with honors. In 2019, Willamette awarded him an honorary doctorate. After his retirement from Deloitte, he received the honorary title of Deloitte Global CEO Emeritus. He and his family live in Oregon, USA.</p>
  <h2 id="candidates-for-shareholder-representative-re-elections">Candidates for Shareholder Representative Re-Elections</h2>
  <p>The SAP Supervisory Board also announces that two candidates will stand for re-election at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders (AGM) in May 2023. The candidates are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jennifer Li (55), Founder and General Partner of Changcheng Investment Partners, Beijing China. If re-elected, her term would expire in 2027.</li>
    <li>Dr. Qi Lu (61), Founder and Chief Executive Officer of MiraclePlus Ltd., Beijing, China. If re-elected, his term would expire in 2027.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The term of Prof. Dr. Gesche Joost, a member of the SVB since 2015, will end with this year’s AGM. “Let me take this opportunity to extend a personal note of thanks to Dr. Joost for her great contributions to SAP’s ongoing success,” said Chairman Hasso Plattner.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong> — SAP today announced a new share repurchase program. The program, with a volume of up to €1 billion, is planned to be executed in the period between February 01 and December 31, 2022. It will be implemented based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of SAP SE on May 17, 2018, and in compliance with the restrictions set forth therein.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Repurchased shares will primarily be used to service future awards granted under the ′Move SAP′ share-based compensation plan.</p>
  <p>‘Move SAP’ is SAP’s long-term employee incentivization and retention plan. It is aimed at rewarding employees who provide a significant impact to business success. The plan accounted for the majority of SAP’s 2018 – 2020 share-based compensation expenses. Under its previous policy, SAP serviced obligations arising from the plan with cash payments but has now decided to settle future awards predominantly in shares.</p>
  <p>Obligations from outstanding ′Move SAP′ awards will continue to be serviced with cash payments and the settlement methods of SAP’s other share-based compensation programs remain unchanged.</p>
  <p>SAP CFO Luka Mucic said: “By settling our share-based compensation predominantly in shares rather than cash payments for new awards issued from 2022 onwards, we intend to further strengthen our employee ownership culture and ensure employees’ interests are closely aligned with those of our shareholders.”</p>
  <p>The new share repurchase program follows SAP’s 2020 repurchase of around 14 million shares for about €1.5 billion.</p>
  <p>More information on the ′Move SAP′ plan can be found in section B.3 (Share-Based Payments) of SAP’s 2020 Integrated Report.</p>

  <h2 id="business-update">Business Update</h2>
  <p>After an initial review of its fourth-quarter 2021 performance, SAP SE (NYSE: SAP) today announced its preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2021. All 2021 figures in this release are approximate due to the preliminary nature of the announcement.</p>
  <p>Businesses around the world are embracing digital technologies and the cloud to transform the way they do business. Today’s unpredictable reality, from supply chain disruptions to new regulatory restrictions, means the need for flexibility and adaptability has never been greater. Our depth of experience in mission critical business processes across all customer sizes, industries and geographies sets us apart and is core to why businesses are choosing SAP for their business transformation.</p>
  <p>The strength and the execution of our strategy is showing up on multiple fronts with exceptional customer momentum across our cloud portfolio and financial performance exceeding market expectations.</p>
  <p>High customer adoption is underpinned by exceptionally strong demand for RISE with SAP across customers of all sizes. It helps customers develop, adopt and automate new business models, and become intelligent enterprises. They also benefit from our Business Network, the largest B2B network in the world, which helps them create more resilient supply chains.</p>
  <p>Customer satisfaction continues to increase, echoed by strong renewal rates.</p>
  <p>SAP is confident that its positive momentum will continue throughout 2022, and expects accelerating cloud revenue growth, supported by strong traction of SAP S/4HANA Cloud.</p>
  <h2 id="financial-performance">Financial Performance</h2>
  <p><strong>Fourth Quarter 2021</strong></p>
  <p>Current cloud backlog accelerated faster than anticipated, up 32% to €9.45 billion and up 26% at constant currencies. SAP S/4HANA current cloud backlog was up 84% to €1.71 billion and up 76% at constant currencies. Cloud revenue was up 28% to €2.61 billion and up 24% at constant currencies. SAP S/4HANA cloud revenue was up 65% to €329 million and up 61% at constant currencies. Software licenses revenue was down 14% year over year to €1.46 billion and down 17% at constant currencies. Cloud and software revenue was up 6% to €6.99 billion and up 3% at constant currencies. Services revenue was up 3% year over year to €0.99 billion and flat at constant currencies. Total revenue was up 6% year over year to €7.98 billion and up 3% at constant currencies.</p>
  <p>The share of more predictable revenue grew by 5 percentage points year over year to 69% in the fourth quarter.</p>
  <p>IFRS operating profit decreased 45% to €1.47 billion and IFRS operating margin decreased by 16.9 percentage points to 18.4% mainly due to higher share-based compensation expenses, primarily related to Qualtrics. Non-IFRS operating profit decreased 11% to €2.47 billion and decreased 12% at constant currencies. Non-IFRS operating margin decreased by 5.8 percentage points to 30.9% and decreased by 5.4 percentage points at constant currencies. Prior year IFRS operating profit included a disposal gain of €194 million and non-IFRS operating profit of €128 million related to the sale of the SAP Digital Interconnect business.</p>
  <p>IFRS earnings per share decreased 23% to €1.24 and non-IFRS earnings per share increased 10% to €1.86.</p>
  <p><strong>Full Year 2021</strong></p>
  <p>SAP hit the high end of its revised 2021 cloud revenue outlook range and exceeded its cloud and software revenue and operating profit outlook ranges.</p>
  <p>IFRS cloud revenue was up 17%, non-IFRS cloud revenue was up 16% to €9.42 billion and up 19% to €9.59 billion at constant currencies, hitting the high end of the revised full year outlook (€9.4 to €9.6 billion non-IFRS at constant currencies). SAP S/4HANA cloud revenue was up 46% to €1.09 billion and up 47% at constant currencies, exceeding the €1 billion cloud revenue mark as anticipated. Software licenses revenue was down 11% year over year to €3.25 billion and down 11% to €3.24 billion at constant currencies. Cloud and software revenue was up 4% year over year to €24.08 billion and up 5% to €24.41 billion at constant currencies, exceeding the revised full year outlook (€23.8 – 24.2 billion non-IFRS at constant currencies). Total revenue was up 2% year over year to €27.84 billion and up 3% to €28.23 billion at constant currencies.</p>
  <p>As anticipated, the share of more predictable revenue grew by 3 percentage points year over year to 75% for the full year 2021.</p>
  <p>For the full year, IFRS operating profit and operating margin were impacted by significantly higher share-based compensation expenses compared to 2020 mainly due to the Qualtrics IPO and the appreciation of SAP’s share price during the year. IFRS operating profit decreased by 30% year over year to €4.66 billion. IFRS operating margin decreased by 7.5 percentage points year over year to 16.7%. Non-IFRS operating profit was down 1% to €8.23 billion and up 1% to €8.41 billion at constant currencies, exceeding the high end of the revised full year outlook (€8.1 – 8.3 billion non-IFRS at constant currencies). Non-IFRS operating margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 29.6% and decreased by 0.5 percentage points at constant currencies.</p>
  <p>IFRS earnings per share increased 3% to €4.46 and non-IFRS earnings per share increased 25% to €6.74, reflecting a strong contribution from Sapphire Ventures throughout the entire year.</p>
  <p>Operating cash flow for the full year is expected to be above €6.0 billion. Free cash flow is expected to be at around €5.0 billion.</p>
  <p><strong>Business Outlook 2022</strong></p>
  <p>For 2022, SAP expects its cloud growth to continue to accelerate. The pace and scale of SAP’s cloud momentum places the Company well on track towards its mid-term ambition.</p>
  <p>For the full year 2022, SAP expects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>€11.55 – 11.85 billion non-IFRS cloud revenue at constant currencies (2021: €9.42 billion), up 23% to 26% at constant currencies.</li>
    <li>€25.0 – 25.5 billion non-IFRS cloud and software revenue at constant currencies (2021: €24.08 billion), up 4% to 6% at constant currencies.</li>
    <li>€7.8 – 8.25 billion non-IFRS operating profit at constant currencies (2021: €8.23 billion), flat to down 5% at constant currencies.</li>
    <li>The share of more predictable revenue (defined as the total of cloud revenue and software support revenue) is expected to reach approximately 78% (2021: 75%).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While SAP’s full-year 2022 business outlook is at constant currencies, actual currency reported figures are expected to be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations as the Company progresses through the year.</p>

  <h3 id="business-update-third-quarter-2021">Business Update Third Quarter 2021</h3>
  <p>Businesses around the world are reevaluating their business models with increased urgency given the dramatic changes due to the pandemic and their ongoing focus on digital transformation. Customers are choosing SAP for its clearly differentiated capabilities. In addition to helping customers manage their technical migrations, SAP is helping customers redefine and optimize their core end-to-end business processes. This expertise is based on SAP’s unmatched knowledge of industry best practices from working with customers of all sizes across industries and geographies. This is reflected in SAP’s strong third quarter results which were above market expectations.</p>
  <p>SAP is seeing continued strong demand and adoption of its ‘RISE with SAP’ offering, which customers of all sizes, including an increasing number of large clients, are selecting to manage their business transformation. As more customers adopt this holistic subscription offering, software licenses revenue decreased as anticipated.</p>
  <p>SAP is seeing strong growth in current cloud backlog across its cloud portfolio, in particular with S/4HANA Cloud. Cloud revenue growth also accelerated sequentially.</p>
  <h3 id="financial-performance-third-quarter-2021">Financial Performance Third Quarter 2021</h3>
  <p>Current cloud backlog was up 24% to €8.17 billion and up 22% (at constant currencies). S/4HANA current cloud backlog was up 60% (Non-IFRS) to €1.28 billion and up 58% (at constant currencies). Cloud revenue was up 20% to €2.39 billion and up 20% (at constant currencies). S/4HANA cloud revenue growth accelerated as anticipated, up 46% to €276 million and up 46% (at constant currencies). Software licenses revenue was down 8% year over year to €0.66 billion and down 8% (at constant currencies). Cloud and software revenue was up 7% to €5.91 billion and up 6% (at constant currencies). Services revenue was down 6% year over year to €0.93 billion and down 6% (at constant currencies). This revenue decline is primarily attributable to the November 2020 divestiture of SAP Digital Interconnect. Total revenue was up 5% year over year to €6.84 billion and up 5% (at constant currencies).</p>
  <p>The share of more predictable revenue grew by 3 percentage points year over year to 77% in the third quarter.</p>
  <p>IFRS operating profit decreased 15% to €1.25 billion and IFRS operating margin decreased by 4.3 percentage points to 18.2% due to higher share-based compensation expenses (primarily related to Qualtrics). Non-IFRS operating profit increased 2% to €2.10 billion (up 2% at constant currencies) and non-IFRS operating margin decreased by 0.9 percentage points to 30.7% (down 0.7 percentage points at constant currencies). Operating profit includes a disposal gain of €77 million related to the launch of SAP Fioneer, a dedicated Financial Services Industry unit jointly owned by SAP and Dediq.</p>
  <p>Earnings per share decreased 10% to €1.19 (IFRS) and increased 2% to €1.74 (non-IFRS), including another strong contribution from Sapphire Ventures.</p>

  <p>SAP is raising its full-year 2021 outlook, reflecting the strong business performance which is expected to continue to accelerate cloud revenue growth. The Company continues to expect a software licenses revenue decline for the full year as more customers turn to the ‘RISE with SAP’ subscription offering for their mission-critical core processes. This outlook also continues to assume the COVID-19 crisis will continue to recede as vaccine programs roll out globally.</p>
  <p>SAP now expects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>€9.4 – 9.6 billion cloud revenue at constant currencies (2020: €8.09 billion), up 16% to 19% at constant currencies. The previous range was €9.3 – 9.5 billion at constant currencies.</li>
    <li>€23.8 – 24.2 billion cloud and software revenue at constant currencies (2020: €23.23 billion), up 2% to 4% at constant currencies. The previous range was €23.6 – 24.0 billion at constant currencies.</li>
    <li>€8.1 – 8.3 billion operating profit at constant currencies (2020: €8.29 billion), flat to down 2% at constant currencies. The previous range was €7.95 – 8.25 billion at constant currencies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SAP continues to expect the share of more predictable revenue to reach approximately 75% (2020: 72%).</p>
  <p>SAP continues to expect operating cash flow of approximately €6.0 billion (2020 €7.2 billion) and free cash flow above €4.5 billion (2020 €6.0 billion).</p>
  <h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
  <p>This press release and all information therein is unaudited.</p>
  <p><strong>Definition of key growth metrics</strong> Current cloud backlog (CCB) is the contractually committed cloud revenue we expect to recognize over the upcoming 12 months as of a specific key date. Thus, it is a subcomponent of our overall remaining performance obligations following IFRS 15.120. For CCB, we take into consideration committed deals only. CCB can be regarded as a lower boundary for cloud revenue to be recognized over the next 12 months, as it excludes utilization-based models without pre-commitments and committed deals, both new and renewal, closed after the key date. For our committed cloud business, we believe the CCB is a valuable indicator of go-to-market success, as it reflects both new contracts closed as well as existing contracts renewed.</p>
  <p>Share of more predictable revenue is the total of cloud revenue and software support revenue as a percentage of total revenue.</p>
