      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The telecommunications business has been revolutionary in its ability to connect individuals worldwide. However, this phenomenal growth has left the sector with a significant portion of the world’s emissions. With increasing data demand, telecommunications companies must prioritize decreasing greenhouse gas emissions throughout their value chain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Scope 3 emissions from activities across suppliers, product lifecycles, and customer usage comprise the overwhelming majority of emissions for telecommunications companies. While progress has been made on scope 1 and 2 emissions, scope 3 emissions remain a blind spot that demands urgent action.

  </div>
  <p><strong>Supply chain</strong><br>Manufacturing, transport, and disposal of network equipment makes up the largest share, such as 60% of Verizon’s total scope 3</p>
  <p><strong>Product usage</strong><br>Energy consumption of infrastructure, data centers, and devices</p>
  <p><strong>Customers</strong><br>Emissions from using products and services represent over 20% for leading telecommunications companies</p>
  <p>While methodologies vary, standards like the <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol</a> enable consistent and transparent scope 3 accounting. Robust data collection and industry alignment will enhance accuracy over time. The urgency of climate action necessitates that telecommunications companies act now to address primary scope 3 hotspots like supply chain and product usage.</p>
  <p>Success requires transparency, cooperation, and immediate commitment to tackle scope 3 emission sources.</p>
  <h2 id="challenges-in-calculating-scope-3-emissions-in-the-telecommunications-industry">Challenges in Calculating Scope 3 Emissions in the Telecommunications Industry</h2>
  <p>Calculating scope 3 emissions poses major challenges for telecommunications companies, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data limitations</strong>: Telecommunications companies lack visibility into supplier and vendor emissions. Greater transparency and coordination are essential.</li>
    <li><strong>Complex value chains</strong>: Varied reporting mechanisms across the vast partner ecosystem create aggregation difficulties.</li>
    <li><strong>Methodology alignment</strong>: Companies must determine boundaries and allocate shared infrastructure emissions while adhering to accounting standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Rapid technology changes</strong>: Emerging solutions like 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT) require continuous emissions monitoring.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Robust data collection, industry collaboration, and transparency will be vital to overcome these obstacles. Standardized methodologies guided by established protocols will enhance accuracy over time.</p>
  <p>Above all, open cooperation across telecommunications value chains is crucial to drive scope 3 progress. From suppliers to customers, aligning stakeholders to prioritize emissions reductions will accelerate the sustainability shift, despite near-term uncertainty. Telecommunications companies have the scale and influence to lead the way.</p>
  <h2 id="strategies-for-mitigating-scope-3-emissions">Strategies for Mitigating Scope 3 Emissions</h2>
  <p>Telecommunications companies can mitigate scope 3 emissions through:</p>
  <p><strong>Supplier collaboration</strong><br>Joint research and development (R&#x26;D), audits, and incentive programs enable partners to reduce their supply chain footprint. AT&#x26;T uses a sustainability scorecard to motivate action.</p>
  <p><strong>Renewable energy</strong><br>Shifting infrastructure and operations to clean power significantly decreases emissions. BT Group and Telefónica aim for 100% renewable electricity use.</p>
  <p><strong>Eco-design</strong><br>Prioritizing recyclable and energy-efficient materials and manufacturing reduces lifecycle impacts. Vodafone’s Eco Rating drives more sustainable devices.</p>

    <li>Collaborate with industry peers and partners to align methodologies and reporting.</li>
    <li>Continuously refine calculations by incorporating improved data sources and emission factors.</li>
    <li>Supplement inventory accounting with scenario modeling to project future emissions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While uncertainties remain, standardized and transparent scope 3 reporting is vital to understand emissions baselines, track progress over time, and hold companies accountable. Investors and customers are increasingly demanding credible disclosure.</p>
  <p>Telecommunications companies should lead the drive towards robust scope 3 accounting and reporting across sectors. Their commitment can catalyze broader adoption of carbon transparency.</p>
  <p>Using SAP Sustainability Data Exchange, telecommunications companies can collaborate with partners, enhance awareness and engagement of stakeholders, gain insights, mitigate risks, and seize opportunities to reduce and offset emissions.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, courageous leadership and collective diligence across telecommunications company value chains are imperative to drive progress. Telecommunications companies have the influence to spearhead robust and transparent scope 3 practices across all sectors. But, success hinges on prioritizing partnerships, integrity, and environmental stewardship above all. The moment for action has come.</p>

      <div>Expectations for green hydrogen to become the fuel of the future are high.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By 2050, according to <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/green-hydrogen/report.pdf">research by Goldman Sachs</a>, green hydrogen could supply up to 25% of the world’s energy needs and become a €13 trillion (US$15 trillion) market. But until we get there, current challenges of storing and transporting hydrogen need to be overcome first.</p>

  <h2 id="not-all-hydrogen-is-created-equal">Not All Hydrogen Is Created Equal</h2>
  <p>In the long run, only CO2-free hydrogen produced with the help of renewable energies is sustainable. However, it will be quite a while before there is enough green hydrogen to meet the growing demand. The reason: there is not enough green electricity. Of the many alternative production methods, the most popular today is blue or grey hydrogen produced from natural gas.</p>
  <p>In the future, many industrial processes will use green or blue hydrogen or downstream products made from it, such as ammonia and methanol. Hydrogen can particularly help clean up emission-intensive industries like transportation, chemical iron, and steel production, which account for about 7% of global CO2 emissions each year. But the high number of potential users contrasts with the limited availability and high production costs of hydrogen.</p>

  <p>In line with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en">European Green Deal</a> to reduce emissions at least 55% by 2030 and make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, governments have adopted similar sustainability goals and consider hydrogen a critical component to reach them. <a href="/2021/05/net-zero-emissions-transformation-journey">Companies are also taking action</a> to support green and digital transformations in the EU. For instance, the <a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/about-us/newsroom/news/press-releases/european-ceo-alliance-emphasizes-cross-industry-collaboration-to-fight-climate-change-5f771e77ccf05b586c3f6508">European CEO Alliance</a> was founded by 12 executives from leading European companies to develop concrete recommendations for action and help companies undergo the green transition. This alliance is driven by the conviction that no company will solve the greatest challenges of our time alone. To succeed, companies need to collaborate across value chains, build partnerships, and work together with governments and academia.</p>
  <p>One project that has emerged from these cross-company efforts is looking at how to accelerate the complete value chain of green hydrogen – from production, transport, storage, and sale, to the energy customer. Instead of operating in silos, these market segments need to be linked together.</p>
  <h2 id="a-data-sharing-platform-as-the-single-source-of-truth">A Data-Sharing Platform as the Single Source of Truth</h2>
  <p>The first prototype of a green hydrogen platform based on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a> looks promising. The platform combines data from all participants of the hydrogen value chain and, therefore, enables better data-driven business decisions. Instead of managing complicated spreadsheets, an energy provider can use the platform as their single source of truth to run simulations and calculate how much energy they can produce, how much they want to sell to the electrolyzer, and how much power they need for vehicles, households, and industries.</p>
  <p>For such platforms to be successful, visibility across the value chain of green hydrogen is a prerequisite. Supply chain solution <a href="https://www.green-token.io/">GreenToken by SAP</a> helps companies to track hydrogen across the entire supply chain, from production to energy customer, via electrolyzers and carriers using blockchain technology. The solution is designed to provide auditable proof of what percentage of the hydrogen is green, blue, or grey. GreenToken can also be used to track <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#:~:text=3%20Emission%20Factors-,Description%20of%20Scope%203%20Emissions,impacts%20in%20its%20value%20chain.&#x26;text=Scope%203%20emission%20sources%20include,downstream%20of%20the%20organization%27s%20activities.">scope 3 CO2 emissions</a> that are caused when hydrogen is imported from far away. Companies can leverage the data to prove that their purchased hydrogen is truly green. They can also see how much CO2 has been created during the journey from production origin to customer site and, therefore, how much they would need to offset to make the hydrogen 100% green again.</p>

    <div>
      <div>For decades it has been clear that the Earth’s climate is changing and our influence on the environment is undisputed. The latest UN (IPCC) <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362">report</a> is the most dire warning ever issued on climate change and a wake-up call for all of us to realize that we can only ensure a sustainable future by taking action.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As a frontrunner in the sustainability movement, SAP has a crucial role to play as an exemplar – such as <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">committing to become carbon neutral by 2023</a> – as well as in helping businesses unlock their potential growth. This is possible through optimizing circular business models with practical and scalable SAP solutions such as <a href="https://youtu.be/AGLb0VzHRO4">SAP Product Footprint Management</a>, which enables companies to account for greenhouse gas emissions in their end-to-end business processes. While SAP’s focus is on innovations that help customers become more sustainable, we as individuals should lead by example by taking steps that lead to a more sustainable living, such as using alternative modes of transportation or reducing single-use plastics.</p>
  <p>Following the vision of a <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-circular-economy/">circular economy</a>, businesses and individuals are advised to set the focus on repurposing and reusing materials, following a cycle of make, use, return, and reuse.</p>
  <p>Achieving circular business models requires completely rethinking supply and value chains across industries to create end-to-end transparency. In the quest to turn waste into value, SAP developed <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/agriculture-supply-chain-mgmt.html?btp=f206a795-9c52-4614-91ea-8928281922e2">SAP Rural Sourcing Management</a>, a solution that can improve visibility into resources across value chains, helping companies understand, control, and manage their impact on the environment. For example, it is estimated that the fashion industry is responsible for <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/fashion-industry-may-use-quarter-of-world-s-carbon-budget-by-2050-61183">10% of global carbon emissions</a>, and, according to UNFCCC, the sector’s emissions are to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/fashion-industry-un-pursue-climate-action-for-sustainable-development">rise by more than 60% by 2030</a> if transformation towards a sustainable fashion industry fails to materialize soon.</p>
  <p>A great use case where the SAP Rural Sourcing Management solution helps streamline the journey to a circular economy is through a sustainable network of businesses, connecting plastic waste collectors in Ghana with recycling companies, manufacturers, brands, and consumers of fashion. In Africa <a href="/2020/10/minimize-plastic-waste-in-ghana-domestic-recycling">less than 20% of plastic waste is being recycled</a>, while the European Union sets a target of 50% by 2025. Ghana has committed to turn this issue into an opportunity by creating a domestic recycling industry that creates jobs as well as supports a clean environment. In urban areas of countries such as Ghana, waste collecting is a means of survival. However, many urban dwellers have poor visibility into the market price of the collected materials, leaving them vulnerable to imposed pricing.</p>

      <div><strong><a href="https://insights.sap.com/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness/">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Through the implementation of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/agriculture-supply-chain-mgmt.html?btp=f206a795-9c52-4614-91ea-8928281922e2">SAP Rural Sourcing Management</a>, waste collectors in Ghana can directly connect to waste aggregators to receive a fair and transparent wage. The plastic resources are then handed over to the recycling companies to transform it into reusable resources. Being transported to different factories and manufacturers, plastic can be used in the production of fashion items. Using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/logistics-business-network.html">SAP Logistics Business Network</a>, full traceability can be achieved along the entire supply chain to help ensure expectations and standards for sustainable production and fair conditions are met.</p>
  <p>To connect and manage the business operations steps within any fashion business, SAP supports brands and retailers that want to capture and control the value of products after sale with recommerce. The aim is to enable and connect recommerce-specific business processes that include buying back, managing, and reselling pre-owned inventory, as well as tracking key financial, customer, and sustainability performance indicators. Any fashion brand can maintain visibility and control re-commerce business to fully capture the opportunities at stake – a profitable reselling business, positive environmental impact, customer acquisition, and expansion of the customer lifetime value.</p>
  <p>SAP technology provides solutions that can transform serious environmental challenges, such as plastic waste, into integral parts of the circular economy. It can bring people and businesses with shared values together to jointly create a more sustainable value chain, where products are used, returned, reused, and given a new purpose.</p>

      <div>The race to zero carbon emissions among car manufacturers <a href="http://www.automobilsport.com/cars-tuning--37,222545,Way-to-Zero-Volkswagen-presents-roadmap-for-climate-neutral-mobility,news.htm">is in full swing</a>. Earlier this month, the world’s largest producer, Volkswagen Group (VW), indicated it would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-electric-emissions/insight-how-low-can-you-go-volkswagen-throws-down-the-emissions-gauntlet-idUSL1N2ML25I">support more ambitious CO2 emissions targets</a>, catching European rivals off guard and putting them under pressure to follow suit.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But the race to “net zero” for the automobile industry is still in the first lap, and the route promises to be long and arduous. Greenhouse gas emissions from the industry account for more than 9% of global emissions – equaling those of the entire European Union. To achieve their individual sustainability targets, companies are dependent on each other for reliable and verifiable data.</p>

  <h2 id="decarbonization-is-all-about-the-data">Decarbonization Is All About the Data</h2>
  <p>Becoming carbon neutral requires managing the carbon footprint of individual products in the supply chain, and to achieve this companies need transparency into the carbon footprints of their upstream suppliers – referred to as <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards_supporting/FAQ.pdf">scope 3 emissions</a>. The problem is that only 21% of business executives are satisfied with the quality of their environmental data, <a href="/2021/04/sustainability-study-from-sap-actions-challenges">according to a global research study from SAP</a>.</p>
  <p>But more accurate carbon footprint data is on the way. “Until now, companies have been using averages to calculate carbon footprint at a product level because there’s been a lack of accurate, granular emissions data and no consistent methodology,” said John Revess, director Net Zero Transformation at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). “To remain a part of global supply chains, it will be necessary for companies to accurately calculate the carbon footprint of their products based on measured values,” predicted Revess. As a member of WBCSD, SAP and other companies are defining a <a href="https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy/Climate/SOS-1.5/Resources/Value-Chain-Carbon-Transparency-Pathfinder-Enabling-decarbonization-through-Scope-3-emissions-transparency">Value Chain Carbon Transparency Pathfinder</a> for the exchange of carbon emissions data.</p>
  <p>“To meet our decarbonization goals, we depend on credible data from our suppliers on the carbon footprints of the components we build our vehicles with,” said Ralf Pfitzner, global head of Sustainability at Volkswagen, at the <a href="https://events.sap.com/sap-sustainability-summit/en/home">SAP Sustainability Summit</a>.</p>
  <p>The two-day online meeting focused on how companies are applying new technologies to reduce their environmental footprint and manage limited resources. “We decided to join SAP in the co-innovation of a digital carbon tracking tool and database, and this is really exciting because there is obviously a demand,” said Pfitzner.</p>
  <p>Volkswagen and SAP are working together toward decarbonization in other ways. In 2020, their CEOs Herbert Diess and Christian Klein joined the <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2021/03/European-CEO-Alliance-advocates-for-ambitious-climate-strategy.html#:~:text=The%20CEO%20Alliance%20considers%20itself,chain%20and%20rapid%20build%2Dup">CEO Alliance for Europe’s Recovery, Reform, and Resilience</a>. The Alliance’s 10 European business leaders have committed 100 billion to decarbonizing their companies and products and are calling for far-reaching climate protection measures.</p>
  <h2 id="massive-investments-necessary-in-electrification-and-digitalization">Massive Investments Necessary in Electrification and Digitalization</h2>
  <p>VW is <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-group-raises-investments-in-future-technologies-to-eur-73-billion-6607">investing a hefty €73 billion</a> to help put its decarbonization challenges in the rear-view mirror. The underlying reasons for <a href="/2021/04/sustainability-study-from-sap-actions-challenges">companies’ investments in environmental issues</a> varies, spanning industry regulations (29%) to society’s approval of their organization (27%) and strengthening company reputation (26%). Uncertainty as to how to embed sustainability into business processes and IT systems is seen as the greatest barrier to implementing plans for action, <a href="/2021/04/sustainability-study-from-sap-actions-challenges">one study concludes</a>.</p>
  <p>Despite the challenges, VW’s Pfitzner is optimistic about achieving the company’s decarbonization targets. VW’s head of sustainability expects digitalization to play a major role in this transformation. “Beyond green electricity, there are plenty of opportunities where digitalization will help us reduce our carbon footprint, for example by hooking the manufacturing data into the cloud and having more efficient programming of robots,” he said.</p>
  <p>Pfitzner reiterated <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/stories/2019/12/what-volkswagen-is-doing-for-the-environment.html">VW’s 2050 goal of carbon neutrality</a> along the entire lifecycle of its cars, emphasizing the need for intermediate milestones. “The coming decades will be essential for the transformation of transport and the car industry. By 2030, we intend to reduce the lifecycle carbon footprint of our passenger car portfolio by 30% compared to 2018,” said Pfitzner.</p>

  <p>Although nearly two-thirds of the global economy is covered by net zero targets, achieving them will require systems thinking and collaborative action among businesses of a type and scale that has never been done before, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/deloitte-announces-senior-partner-appointments-in-climate-change-and-transport.html">said Hannah Routh</a>, partner, Deloitte UK. “The proof will be in the implementation,” she predicted.</p>
  <p>“No business or country can become net zero in isolation,” said Routh. “Whether you are looking at energy supply, transportation, infrastructure, government, or communities, they all need to act in a coordinated way.”</p>
  <p>One of the biggest challenges for companies, says Routh, is embedding climate transformation into their business strategies and decision-making processes. This requires data transparency, she emphasizes, noting that there is no shortage of data, but the quality and usability of the data must be ensured.</p>
  <p>Nicolas Peter, BMW’s chief financial officer, agrees. “Digitalization helps in a significant way to increase data quality, and, from an auditor’s perspective, data quality is key in order to perform his responsibility in the audit process,” he said at SAP’s Sustainability Summit. Peter left no doubts that BMW is counting on new technologies to help it <a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/blog/bmw-joins-growing-list-of-automakers-committed-to-bold-climate-action/">achieve its climate targets</a>: “The trend to sustainability has to be accompanied by digitalization. There is no alternative,” said Peter.</p>
  <h2 id="digitalization-supports-decarbonization">Digitalization Supports Decarbonization</h2>
  <p>“CEOs need transparency into their supply chains,” said Thomas Saueressig, head of Product Engineering and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “Through its strategic initiative <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/sustainability/climate21">Climate 21</a>, SAP is launching new solutions that help customers reduce their emissions and manage their carbon footprint.”</p>
  <p>A new integrated set of solutions announced at the SAP Sustainability Summit includes SAP Product Footprint Management, which treats greenhouse gases like a ‘currency’ in the value chain. “Our sustainability management solutions enable companies not only to optimize their production facilities according to top line and bottom line, but also according to greenhouse gas emissions,” said Saueressig. As part of several joint sustainability initiatives with Accenture, <a href="/2021/04/sap-and-accenture-sustainability-better-business">SAP and Accenture are working</a> to develop new SAP solutions that address sustainability and enhance existing core technologies.</p>
  <h2 id="the-need-for-speed">The Need for Speed</h2>
  <p>Setting data quality issues aside, the most important factor for transforming businesses to net-zero is speed, said Deloitte’s Routh. “I think the world can master this, but my concern is whether it can do it quickly enough. The businesses that are going to succeed are the ones that understand and embrace the urgency.”</p>
