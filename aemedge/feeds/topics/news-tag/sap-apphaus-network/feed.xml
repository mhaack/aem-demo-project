      <div>Innovation takes a diverse team of people with different expertise and skill sets working together in proximity to generate the “aha moment.” With the restrictions caused by the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>, the SAP AppHaus team developed a way to best maintain collaboration remotely, on-site, and in a mixed or hybrid working model.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This journey of ups and downs from adapting to optimizing the setup has been published in “<a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/next-wow">The Next WoW (Way of Working)”, a free and accessible whitepaper</a>. It describes how continuous co-innovation and collaboration with customers has been possible in changing work environments and how other companies and innovators across the globe can learn and benefit from the experience.</p>

  <p>When the pandemic disrupted the way we collaborated at the beginning of 2020, it wasn’t an option for the SAP AppHaus team to stop innovating with customers and partners. Instead, they took the opportunity to grow and learn from the situation. <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/approach">SAP’s human-centered approach to innovation</a>, which combines design thinking and architecture thinking, underlines the importance of collaboration among different stakeholders and end users. To enable efficient virtual meetings, SAP AppHaus launched the <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/innovation-toolkit-for-virtual-collaboration-bundle">Innovation Culture Toolkit for virtual collaboration</a> last year. But this was just the beginning.</p>

  <p>The SAP AppHaus Network, with its 21 locations spread across the globe, stands for sustainable co-innovation with customers. With a user-centered approach and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> as the solid foundation for custom-tailored innovation in the Intelligent Enterprise, the network brings innovation to life. Previously, the process of innovating has been reliant on physical meetings and workshops with all stakeholders attending, but things have changed during the pandemic. The requirements frequently switched from lockdown scenarios to office re-openings, back to social distancing regulations based on the current health situation – all of which needed spontaneous adaptation.</p>
  <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/656182286">The Next Way of Working | Experience a full day of hybrid work across the global SAP AppHaus team</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/apphaus">SAP AppHaus</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
  <p>In response, a new hybrid setup had to replace on-site meetings, as reflected in “<a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/next-wow">The Next WoW</a>.” The ongoing collaboration adjustments allowed for numerous successful innovation projects with several companies. Among them are: <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/work/project/iren-innovates-invoice-processing-with-sap-business-technology-platform">Iren</a> in Italy, <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/work/project/border-states-inc-order-management-cockpit-on-sap-business-technology-platform">Border States Electric</a> in the U.S., <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/work/project/improved-market-share-forecast-accuracy-using-intuitive-analytics-tool">Ottogi</a> in South Korea, <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/work/project/sunrice-grower-and-admin-portal-with-sap-btp">SunRice</a> in Australia, <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/work/project/fostering-innovation-sustainability-with-sap-business-technology-platform">Royal Greenland A/S</a> in Greenland, <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/work/project/border-states-inc-order-management-cockpit-on-sap-business-technology-platform">and many more</a>. Some of these were conducted by SAP AppHaus and some by SAP AppHaus Network partners like <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/location/melbourne">Bourne Digital</a> and <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/location/aarhus">Trifork</a>.</p>
  <p>No doubt, the successful completion of these projects was only possible because the new hybrid collaboration models were thoroughly planned. Applying these principles of collaboration enabled SAP AppHaus, its sister team SAP Platform Adoption and Advisory, and other SAP teams to seamlessly support key SAP initiatives such as SAP Discovery Center with its actionable use cases (58 use cases created so far), RISE with SAP, the Intelligent Enterprise, and SAP Business Technology Platform.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-discovery-center--a-self-service-for-customers">SAP Discovery Center – a Self-Service for Customers</h2>
  <p>Recently, SAP launched a new self-service for customers called <a href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/">SAP Discovery Center</a>. With this low-threshold portal, SAP can help customers quickly adopt SAP Business Technology Platform and turn data into real business value. Due to the disruption of many highly relevant business processes during the pandemic, there is an increased need for flexible solutions that can be integrated and scaled easily.</p>

The knowledge gained, such as technical realization, is turned into a mission and made available for all SAP customers. Examples of these <a href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/search/UCF*">actionable use cases</a> include the invoice management process of Iren (<a href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3392/3431/">Mission: “Gaining transparency into supplier invoice and purchase order processing”</a>) or the chatbot functionality of <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/work/project/sap-conversational-ai-helps-fight-pandemic-at-parkland-hospital">Parkland</a> (<a href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3327/3369/">Mission: “Improve online patient experience using a COVID-19 chatbot”</a>).</p>
  <p>Another step towards free accessible knowledge sharing and exchange is the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/trial.html">free tier model for SAP BTP</a>, which allows a free-of-cost version for customers to try out before buying. <a href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/search/Free-tier">Many use cases are available</a> to try out and test.</p>

  <p>Regarding the <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/toolkit">Innovation Culture Toolkit</a>, the free collection of methods and best practices got a revamp this year and now it’s even easier to apply and benefit from its resources. With that, a few new assets have been published, like the <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/toolkit/methods#architecture-thinking">The Lean Architecture Toolkit</a>. The newest kid on the block is the updated material for <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/spectrum">Spectrum</a> to support the setup of innovation teams within an organization. It is free, downloadable, and printable to make it possible to run Spectrum workshops on your own.</p>
  <h2 id="straight-into-2022">Straight into 2022</h2>
  <p>“The Next WoW” whitepaper summarizes the ultimate learning and outcome of all co-innovation efforts the global SAP AppHaus team has run during the last year. For several months and together with SAP AppHaus Network and other SAP colleagues, the AppHaus 2.0 team – a team focused on the evolution and development of changed working circumstances – jointly conducted interviews, experiments, and tested new work settings. “The Next WoW” whitepaper is the first public share-out representing the starting point for innovative work scenarios in the future. It is supposed to inspire and support other innovators, companies, and organizations on their way to the next way of working. “The Next WoW” helps sustain the creative work with customers and partners. In brief, it helps customers be successful.</p>
  <p>By the looks of it, the SAP AppHaus Network teams are well prepared for a new year to come. They look forward to conducting many more interesting and, yes, challenging customer projects. The new work concept is a living one; it evolves and grows with many more co-innovation and collaboration experiences to come.</p>

      <div>Innovation is built into the DNA at <a href="https://bluestonex.com/">Bluestonex</a> – it’s what makes it tick. As part of SAP AppHaus Network, it shifted its entire business processes to run on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), making this boutique team the perfect advocate for converting its own customers to the tech platform.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Recognized for design, innovation, and user experience, Bluestonex began using the application development and integration capabilities of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP BTP</a> in 2018, then known as SAP Cloud Platform, because of its speed and agility.</p>
  <p>“Being an innovation partner, we wanted to be able to move and deliver quickly for our customers,” explains Dan Barton, COO and co-founder. “SAP BTP allows us to do that. Plus, the low-cost, high-impact nature of the platform is always going to be an attractive proposition to customers. So, it was a clear route for us as a business and for our customers.”</p>
  <p>Bluestonex sees itself as a true integration of a client’s team, holding their hands as they shift to SAP BTP. They work with customers of all shapes and sizes and from cross-industry sectors, everything from food and drinks to aerospace. However, Barton is clear that SAP BTP breaks down any misconceptions that SAP is purely for larger-sized businesses.</p>
  <p>“It’s very, very well-suited to micro-businesses. It’s agile, it’s low-cost from an entry point of view, and it has a huge number of capabilities that can grow over time. SAP BTP has opened up new opportunities for us within the micro-business market because, typically, there isn’t another product out there to match it.”</p>
  <p>Barton says customers can often become “over-awed” when faced with all the different tech products available to run and manage businesses. He and the team use SAP BTP to “transform that user experience.”</p>
  <p>“It’s a really easy entry point: instead of people having to use multiple clicks and screen jumps, SAP BTP gets rid of that. It streamlines and strips away complexity to give a consistent user experience,” Barton explains. “And that transformation is key. When they realize what a nice platform it is, it opens the door to other experiences, such as chatbots and automation. It’s all there and plugs in really nicely. Lots of customers love the fact that they can start small and grow with the platform.”</p>

      <div><strong><a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/network">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It also helps Bluestonex to grow as a business, driving its specialism in innovation and, in turn, encouraging customers to think in new ways. “This is a massive shift, not only are they going from running different processes into one, smooth, easy-to-use platform, we’re seeing a big cultural shift in the way our customers think,” he adds.</p>
  <p>Being part of SAP AppHaus Network means Bluestonex can access the latest, state-of-the-art design thinking methodologies, helping to move customers to new digital experiences.</p>
  <p>From its converted chapel office space, Bluestonex regularly invites customers in to co-innovate.</p>
  <p>“We invite our customers here and bring them out of their comfort zone,” says Barton. “And we have a usability lab where we get customer input on an idea as early in the development process as possible, so that key stakeholders know what they’re going to get and can be part of the iteration process. This helps to set expectations and build a better business case.”</p>
  <p>To sum up SAP BTP in three words? “Strategic, innovative, and responsive,” he says. “It’s opened a different angle for us. We would always go and speak to our existing SAP customers, but this is different. Now we go to a competitor’s customer, we go to micro-businesses, because it’s flexible and cost effective. SAP BTP is a very strategic platform: there’s a sense that whatever a business does in the future, that platform is going to be there and continue to add value. It’s future-proof and I’m a massive advocate for it.”</p>

  <p>Growers had become frustrated with existing solutions, which could not provide them quick and easy access to functions that are key to supporting the auxiliary business processes associated with growing rice. Challenges included:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>There were difficulties accessing key industry information.</li>
    <li>Where real-time information on harvest deliveries was key, growers could only access dated reports.</li>
    <li>There was limited mobile access to the portal, preventing users from performing tasks and reviewing information when in the field.</li>
    <li>The legacy solution did not provide an intuitive experience, leaving growers unable to find the correct information at the right time.</li>
    <li>It was essential for the company to streamline administrative processes such as the existing process of creating a contract over the phone.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="user-centric-design-process-to-involve-all-stakeholders">User-Centric Design Process to Involve All Stakeholders</h2>
  <p>SunRice teamed up with SAP and <a href="https://experience.sap.com/designservices/network">SAP AppHaus Network</a> partner <a href="https://experience.sap.com/designservices/location/melbourne">Bourne Digital</a> to transform its growers’ portal and yield significant user experience improvements by extending existing systems using SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).</p>

  <p><em>On-site research and interviews with growers</em></p>
  <p>To understand the needs of the end user, the designers and a small subset of growers met and took a close look at a usual day in the life of a grower. This research helped to create several personas to better understand existing pain points. The approach allowed for deeper, holistic insights into the current processes for both grower and administrative tasks, their core frustrations, and opportunities for improvement.</p>
  <p>Throughout the design-driven process, designs were user-tested and iterated to address the common grower frustrations. Feedback from the end users was implemented to refine the solution in alignment with best practices regarding accessibility and user experience.</p>

  <p>As a result, SunRice and Bourne Digital developed a new Grower Portal and an Admin Portal on SAP BTP. This solution suite simplifies, streamlines, and enhances the user experience for growers and admins. What’s more, the platform is built on an extensible architecture, thus allowing the solution to be further extended and enhanced. Through a user-centered approach to design and implementation, the new portal addressed user pain points in a targeted way. It offers the following opportunities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In a new Harvest Dashboard, data visualization for harvest moisture, trash, and dry weight assist in making important decisions. Real-time updates for harvest deliveries helps ensure growers are both informed and engaged.</li>
    <li>Quick links to important information is available; via the My Payments tile, growers can view — in near real time — their payments received and upcoming. They can also download their tax and delivery documents at their convenience.</li>
    <li>Opt-in harvest delivery and other alerts help keep growers informed, giving them instant notification of delivery receipt, which is particularly helpful when they are out in the field harvesting.</li>
    <li>With mobility, growers no longer need to wait to access the portal on their desktop, they can now access information and perform tasks all from their mobile devices.</li>
    <li>Through online forms, wherever they are, growers can now access and submit key forms such as Trading and Farm details leveraging SAP BTP workflow. For the Admin team, approvals using the SAP Fiori app, “My Inbox,” are now a reality. Approvals and updates can thus be made seamlessly.</li>
    <li>With grower resources, growers can easily access the most relevant and up-to-date information to assist them.</li>
    <li>The user-friendly interface on the portal is built with <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/fiori">SAP Fiori</a>, which allows for a <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/01/29/next-step-of-sap-fiori-3-available-quartz-dark-theme/">dark mode screen</a> to provide a better view in the sun.</li>

  <p>The primary focus of the new solution was to make growers’ lives easier through the regular operational and communication touch points that connect them to SunRice. The refreshed look and usability of the new portal have made information more accessible with clear user guidance, tabs, and dashboards for simple navigation.</p>
  <p>Growers no longer have to access the portal on their desktop; they can now access information and perform tasks all from their mobile devices. In particular, growers can now view delivery information and other critical data instantly, remotely, and effortlessly, and can receive alerts direct to their phones for added mobility and convenience.</p>
  <p>The grower portal was released just prior to the rice harvest season in early 2021. During this time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>More than 400 growers accessed the portal during harvest.</li>
    <li>Over 9,000 harvest alerts sent to keep growers informed about their deliveries. Growers opt in to these alerts via the portal.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="sunrice-ui5-admin-portal-as-the-perfect-counterpart">SunRice UI5 Admin Portal as the Perfect Counterpart</h2>
  <p>The Admin Portal is built using SAPUI5 and to be used by SunRice administrators for the following tasks: approve grower and farm detail changes; create and approve contract requests; post key messages to growers; and manage Grower Portal resources and forms.</p>

  <p>New features such as contracts have already been added to the Grower and Admin portals after the initial implementation. Contracts provide the ability for growers to apply for contracts in the Grower’s portal and the ability for admins to create and approve contracts in the Admin portal.</p>
  <p>SunRice is exploring further ways to improve the portal, including bringing enhanced reporting capabilities to the new system and continuing to gather feedback directly from growers to inform new changes, design edits, and added functionality.</p>
  <p>By putting growers at the heart of decision making, SunRice is driving new innovations that make a real difference for the grower community.</p>
