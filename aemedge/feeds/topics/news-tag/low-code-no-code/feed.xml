      <div>Today’s rapidly changing market requirements put businesses under increased pressure to adapt and stay competitive. The rising demand for cloud solutions, a growing talent gap, and the expectation to do more with less while ensuring security and compliance continue to strain the capacity of development teams.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To address this challenge, SAP has been investing in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/low-code.html">low-code/no-code solutions</a> that improve overall developer efficiency, enable more employees to automate tedious tasks, and create applications that simplify work in a compliant and secure fashion — all of this without needing to write a single line of code.</p>
  <p>We are excited to announce several new capabilities in our low-code/no-code portfolio today at SAP Sapphire.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/appgyver.html">SAP AppGyver</a> is a no-code application development platform that enables developers of all skill levels to create enterprise-ready applications with drag-and-drop simplicity.</p>
  <p>With the integration of SAP AppGyver in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/service-cloud.html">SAP Service Cloud</a>, all SAP Service Cloud users can create custom applications to extend functionality without needing to write code. For example, SAP Service Cloud users can visually create apps for service agents that allow them to serve their customers better by connecting and acting on data from other systems such as SAP S/4HANA. This way, the service agent can log into SAP Service Cloud to find out what equipment the customer is using, see a list of compatible spare parts, and view inventory in SAP S/4HANA without leaving SAP Service Cloud. In addition, users can also use the SAP Fiori design system, which provides templates, tools, and guidelines to create beautiful mobile and web apps.</p>

  <h2 id="create-no-code-business-logic-using-visual-cloud-functions">Create No-Code Business Logic Using Visual Cloud Functions</h2>
  <p>Turning an idea into an app used to require extensive development skills. SAP AppGyver already offers developers a no-code tool to build the front end of an app. In the next few months, we plan to add additional cloud-powered capabilities that will allow all SAP AppGyver users to visually create cloud-hosted data models and serverless application logic without any code.</p>
  <p>With the entire backend process also visual, SAP AppGyver users will no longer need to leave the no-code environment to build fully functional and scalable enterprise-grade applications. For more information about the current and future capabilities of SAP AppGyver, see the <a href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?range=CURRENT-LAST&#x26;PRODUCT=73554900100800003801#Q2%202022">SAP Road Map Explorer</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk6AC4XdvyA">Verge</a> is an example of a customer that used SAP AppGyver to accelerate application development and built multiple applications for the entire manufacturing process, all deeply integrated with its manufacturing systems.</p>
  <p>“Speed of innovation is of great importance to us,” said Tuomo Lehtimäki, CEO of Verge Motorcycles. “With SAP AppGyver, we were able to develop and integrate a custom, highly flexible system to orchestrate our entire manufacturing process in just a few months — all without having to write a line of code. The apps provide real-time insights into our operations and help us make decisions faster.”</p>

  <p>Earlier this year, SAP announced the general availability of <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/process-automation.html">SAP Process Automation</a>, which combines workflow management and robotic process automation into a single no-code drag-and-drop solution. It enables companies of all sizes to create workflows, automate repetitive or manual tasks, and simplify and improve business processes.</p>
  <p>New SAP Process Automation capabilities make it even easier for business and development teams to collaborate while helping ensure security and governance. Professional developers can develop advanced processes and business logic and create reusable sub-flows that can be made available to business users. Business users can leverage these sub-flows and create sophisticated workflows and automation in a visual, no-code fashion in compliance with IT requirements. More information about recent and upcoming functionality can be found in <a href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/190af73e1b314925bc5f3bf8751fc9ce?locale=en-US&#x26;version=Cloud">SAP Help Portal</a> and <a href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73554900100800003832&#x26;range=CURRENT-LAST#Q2%202022">SAP Road Map Explorer</a>.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>When it comes to responding to an urgent need by quickly developing an automation solution to minimize laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone manual work, robotic process automation (<a href="/topics/rpa">RPA</a>) delivers great value.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But this is just a first step. Taken to the next level, intelligent RPA, also called “hyperautomation,” offers even more valuable benefits by combining traditional RPA with artificial intelligence (AI) and low-code/no-code development.</p>
  <p>As an example, repetitive tasks and routine activities in finance, purchasing, and customer service were preventing Villeroy &#x26; Boch, one of Europe’s oldest ceramic manufacturers, from improving operational efficiency and delivering great customer service. The German premium tableware and bathroom products company implemented SAP Intelligent RPA for routine activities, helping streamline workflows and free up staff to focus on strategic activities.</p>
  <p>Like other SAP customers benefiting from hyperautomation, Villeroy &#x26; Boch started with automating simple, frequently occurring tasks, such as responding to standard e-mail inquiries with attended RPA bots. Previously known as robotic desktop automation, attended RPA is a software assistant for the human user and interacts with a desktop application while respecting applicable business logic.</p>
  <p>Operating internationally in 125 countries demands smooth workflows and operational efficiency across several business functions, but the ceramics group always had a bigger vision. The company wanted to create a fully automated invoice error-handling process by combining SAP Intelligent RPA and SAP AI Business Services to handle unstructured data and documents.</p>
  <p>Now advanced RPA bots autonomously trigger tasks and automate more complex work such as processing attachments from e-mails according to their type and predefined confidence thresholds. So far, the 10 digital assistants Villeroy &#x26; Boch has deployed are handling 66,000 documents a year.</p>
  <p>“Although we’re just at the beginning of our journey with SAP Intelligent RPA, we are already realizing its potential to help us work more efficiently, serve customers better, and gain competitive advantage,” said Daniel Neuhaeuser, head of ERP Core Solutions at Villeroy &#x26; Boch.</p>
  <p>The advantages of going beyond traditional RPA and tapping the potential of hyperautomation are becoming more widely acknowledged. Industry analysts have forecast that the worldwide hyperautomation-enabling software market will reach nearly US$600 billion by 2022.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hyperautomation services such as SAP Intelligent RPA enable companies to quickly and easily create bots to emulate human users and automate tedious, repetitive, mundane tasks. For example, today’s office workers spend a lot of time moving between different applications and must often reenter or copy and paste data, such as a customer’s name and address details, from one application to another.</p>
  <p>Earlier this year, SAP Intelligent RPA was cited as a Strong Performer in <a href="https://reprints2.forrester.com/#/assets/2/702/RES161538/report">The Forrester Wave™: Robotic Process Automation, Q1 2021</a>. According to the report, “SAP’s RPA solution is a strong alternative for SAP customers, particularly for enterprises concerned with bots disrupting core SAP systems and those usually needing the central SAP development team to design, develop, and maintain RPA for clear accountability, or for companies seeking a feature-rich RPA tool that comes with a broad ecosystem of partners.”</p>
  <p>Typically, customers report that SAP Intelligent RPA deployments free up between 15 and 30% of employees’ time, which means they can focus on tasks that deliver greater value to the organization and improve the customer experience.</p>
  <p>Specific benefits of using SAP Intelligent RPA include being able to use tools such as <a href="https://insights.sap.com/tackling-software-developer-shortage-citizen-developers-lcnc/">low-code or no-code platforms</a>, built-in integration and content for business process management, and fast, cost-effective deployment. By opening current tools to everyone in the enterprise, SAP Intelligent RPA extends its reach beyond software developers. Business users who have no coding skills but have functional expertise and technical acumen can become citizen developers and build their own automations.</p>
  <p>To support this mission and help automate tasks in business processes, SAP Intelligent RPA offers a new bot-building and execution experience and a cloud-based design studio. This allows users to create and deploy software bots as digital assistants that automate repetitive tasks through a low-code approach.</p>
  <p>This low-code tooling speeds up implementation time and offers a short time to value. More than 200 prebuilt bots are now available within SAP Intelligent RPA to help automate tasks, improve productivity, and make work more interesting for employees.</p>

    <div>
      <div>It’s been a long time since developers have hand-coded everything from scratch. I remember being an IT systems engineer at the Hasso Plattner Institute in 2007 — things were very different than they are today.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Since then, the <strong>demand for professional developer talent has continued to grow</strong> faster than the world can educate them. In part to deal with this challenge, technology developers have increasingly composed software by working with libraries and the like, rather than rewriting the same code over and over. Working this way saves time and gives more agility.</p>
  <p>Today, the latest progression of this trend can be found in the low–code and no–code (LCNC) solutions for application development, extensibility services, experience management, and end-to-end process automation.</p>
  <p><a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> is considered an accelerant for digital process automation — it is, of course — but the space was already rapidly developing. LCNC solutions that empower more employees to digitize and automate their work offer a pathway to greater enterprise resilience. The pandemic brings the benefits of such agility into stark contrast, further propelling adoption. Take robotic process automation (RPA) for example, where Gartner predicts “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-21-gartner-says-worldwide-robotic-process-automation-software-revenue-to-reach-nearly-2-billion-in-2021">90% of large organizations globally will have adopted RPA in some form by 2022</a>.”*</p>
  <p>The goal of these technologies is to allocate human resources more intelligently and to empower the end user — the professional developer as well as the citizen developer — to focus on more valuable work while taking control of digitizing and automating their processes. <strong>LCNC is faster, more efficient, and frees up professional developer time for more complex activities</strong>, like security and big migration/integration projects. Most importantly, LCNC and automation technology build systemic resiliency and responsiveness into the daily functioning of a large organization, while fostering compliance and governance, with defined workflows and clear responsibilities.</p>

  <p>As large companies aim to become more future-proof, they see LCNC and automation platforms as an immediate opportunity on the horizon. Gartner indicates that “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3991199/magic-quadrant-for-enterprise-low-code-application-platf">by 2023, over 50% of medium to large enterprises will have adopted an LCAP as one of their strategic application platforms</a>.”</p>
  <p>Low-code application development platforms (LCAPs) mainly provide tools and services to easily set up and configure processes and workflows, whereas automation platforms enable companies to easily automate recurring manual work. This begins with the conversion of paper-based processes into digitized workflows then leads to the seamless combination of digital workers with human-led processes.</p>
  <p>With decades of process knowledge across industries and lines of business, SAP is well-positioned to provide the expertise and tooling needed by our customers to advance automation with LCNC digital transformation.</p>
  <p>We are firmly established with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) and citizen automation products for Business Process Improvement such as <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/workflow-management">SAP Workflow Management</a> and <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/intelligent-rpa">SAP Intelligent RPA</a>. And we have further extended our competitiveness with the recent acquisitions of <a href="/2021/01/sap-to-acquire-signavio">Signavio</a> and <a href="/2021/02/sap-acquire-appgyver">AppGyver</a>.</p>

  <p>Signavio strengthens SAP’s ability to keep the promise to support customers in their digital transformations by offering a holistic approach and technology in the business process intelligence space. Signavio enhances existing capabilities and allows us to provide standardized process KPIs, broad benchmarking data, process mining, customer journey mapping, user behavior mining, and customer experience analysis. We can give users a complete view of every business process and recommend how to solve identified issues and drive change efficiently.</p>
  <p>AppGyver is a pioneering no-code development platform with a strong developer community that complements both SAP’s own as well as our partners’ offerings for citizen developers. The cloud-based builder for creating web and mobile apps is extremely simple yet immensely powerful; users can visually craft logic flows of any complexity, access native device capabilities, and connect to SAP data and services (and any additional third-party APIs) via OData and other REST API integrations.</p>
  <p>Further to that, SAP has already been partnering with Mendix to offer a low-code development platform, streamlining and simplifying development for professional developers. Mendix and AppGyver enhance SAP BTP with full flexibility and capabilities that allow business users to build web and mobile applications, from low–code to no–code.</p>
  <p>With these additions to our strong portfolio, SAP BTP is in a unique position to help many customers implement digital transformation for end-to-end process automation. For example, <a href="https://www.sap.com/bin/sapdxc/inm/attachment.10549/pitch-deck.pdf">Murphy Oil Corporation</a> was able to achieve significant productivity gains and improved forecast planning through different initiatives leveraging SAP Business Technology Platform, in particular SAP Workflow Management and SAP Intelligent RPA. Standardization resulted in better decision-making, and the use of more granular trend analysis resulted in a 25% reduction of G&#x26;A expenses.</p>
  <p>Looking to the future, the landscape is changing but the demand for professional developers remains high and growing. Companies continue to evolve on their <strong>mission for greater speed and agility</strong>, with a particular eye on their citizen developers as the next major agents for expanding digital capabilities. The breadth of the SAP technology portfolio, our process knowledge across all lines of business, and the high-value data running through SAP systems translate into solutions for our users and measurable outcomes for our customers.</p>
  <p>As we create a unified, business-centric, and open platform with a marketplace for the Intelligent Enterprise, customers, partners, and cloud users can count on SAP for future-proofed <strong>resilience</strong>.</p>
