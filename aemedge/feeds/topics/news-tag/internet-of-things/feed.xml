  <p>They were able to immediately divert traffic and avoid any injuries. NPRA Director of Technology Trond Michael Andersen explains how Internet of Things (IoT) sensors not only increase safety but also help reduce the costs of repairing or replacing the country’s 5,800 bridges. Furthermore, Marit Reiso, senior technical project manager at SAP Norway, shows and explains how the model created by the sensor data is continuously broadcasted to an SAP cloud application.</p>

      <div>You may not see BITZER’s products, but you can feel their effects everywhere, from fresh foods to pleasantly air-conditioned buildings and reliably cooled industrial complexes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With local roots in Germany and a global presence, the BITZER group is represented in more than 90 countries with 72 locations and over 3,800 employees. The company has been providing innovative products and services for 87 years. Its products maintain the optimum temperature in buses, trains, and buildings as well as ensure foods stays fresh at all times on their way to consumers.</p>
  <h2 id="transforming-to-aid-customers-and-gain-competitive-edge">Transforming to Aid Customers and Gain Competitive Edge</h2>
  <p>I recently spoke with BITZER’s Eugen Bonelis, digital solution manager, and Christian Stenzel, director of Organization and IT.</p>
  <p>Bonelis started by saying, “To support BITZER’s innovation and future growth strategy, the company set an objective to transform from a compressor manufacturer to a provider of compressor-enabled services. With the transformation of our business model, customer service would be taken to the next level.”</p>
  <p>“To achieve this goal, we needed a central platform that would allow us to digitally connect our compressors to enable customers to monitor machine status in real time, access configuration data and documentation, and review operational reports,” he continued,</p>
  <p>This network provides solutions for remote troubleshooting to keep machines running efficiently while helping BITZER transform its business model, future proof the enterprise for changing market dynamics, and keep its competitive edge.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By integrating a suite of SAP solutions to digitally connect its refrigeration technology, BITZER is helping its customers optimize operations and tap into new digital solutions.</p>
  <p>For example, <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-iot-internet-of-things/">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>-enabled compressors and solutions provide situational awareness of the real-time operation in the new digital network. This facilitates tailored customer alerts based on sensor readings, status reports, and data analytics services, helping to provide an overview of the customer’s ecosystem in a service-oriented interface.</p>
  <p>“We can now connect applications, processes, and people through SAP solutions to distribute information and deploy operation analytics,” Stenzel explained. “By monitoring operational data remotely in real time and using advanced data analytics, we can instantly identify operational issues and offer actionable insights, including spare parts preorder capabilities, shortening downtime and supporting customized operational reports.”</p>
  <h2 id="developing-a-customer-centric-experience">Developing a Customer-Centric Experience</h2>
  <p>Bonelis discussed the importance of great customer engagement, saying, “It’s important to be close to your customers, be creative, and provide solutions to their needs. With SAP Business Technology Platform and SAP Asset Intelligence Network, we can provide 360-degree information that enables an outstanding customer focus.”</p>
  <p>The benefits are clear. Major outcomes BITZER achieved include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Complete, real-time overview of customer product portfolios and product history</strong>, from the initial order throughout the entire lifecycle of the compressor with the BITZER Digital Network, which connects all BITZER products to the cloud</li>
    <li><strong>Increased ability to break down information and departmental silos</strong>, operating as a single company focused on customer outcomes while growing the business</li>
    <li><strong>A basis for BITZER’s partners to transform their own business models</strong> into a service provider for refrigeration</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced customer satisfaction</strong>, enabling the business to digitize and tap into new product, service, and market opportunities while customers regard BITZER as a valuable partner</li>
    <li><strong>Increased revenues by providing new services</strong> spanning equipment monitoring, operational reports, and instant remote assistance in the event of defects</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced compressor downtime</strong> thanks to data analysis capabilities, leading to a competitive advantage for both BITZER and its customers</li>
    <li><strong>Increased energy efficiency</strong> through optimization of compressor operation by leveraging BITZER’s know-how</li>
  </ul>
  <p>BITZER worked with the SAP Services and Support team to create the new asset network and connect its customers’ refrigeration and air conditioning products and related operational data in the cloud.</p>
  <p>“The support of SAP, especially the Customer First program, has been very important for us. We have exchanged many ideas that have led to exciting new initiatives for our company,” remarked Stenzel. “You can’t buy digitalization, but you can simplify the way toward it. Working with the SAP Services and Support team helped us combine SAP software, business- and customer-focused know-how, as well as customer-focused innovation to create instant value for our customers.”</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>It used to be that companies viewed data as a byproduct of their business. Companies knew it had value but didn’t know how to properly utilize it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But as economies have digitized, business leaders now recognize that data is at the heart of digital businesses. It fuels differentiation, strategy, rapid innovation, and other important elements of running a successful business. Moreover, truly data-driven companies tend to generate 8% to 10% more profit and are 23 times more likely to acquire new customers – which fuels significantly higher market valuation – compared to their peers.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, organizations struggle to unite and access real-time data. Companies generate a lot of data, and while they have good intentions to use that data, it’s stuck in siloes. That makes it hard to leverage data to optimize business processes across the organization. According to research firm, <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/hadoop-is-datas-darling-for-a-reason/">Forrester</a>, “Between 60% and 73% of all data within an enterprise goes unused for analytics.”</p>
  <p>Below are some suggestions for customers embarking on an enterprise data strategy that will help bring data of all kinds together, allowing companies to turn data into business value.</p>

  <h2 id="leave-your-data-where-it-is">Leave Your Data Where It Is</h2>
  <p>Too often companies try to centralize data via a large, top-down project where data from across the organization must be brought into a central repository. The problem with this approach: by the time you bring together data from across different parts of an organization into one place, it’s outdated.</p>
  <p>People need to shift their mindset to connecting – rather than collecting – data. When you consider your data strategy, prioritize a digital business platform that can automatically pull data from wherever it resides – whether that’s your supply chain or finance teams’ applications or somewhere else. Doing that helps ensure your employees can work with real-time information from across the company.</p>
  <h2 id="make-sure-you-can-handle-all-data-types">Make Sure You Can Handle All Data Types</h2>
  <p>Organizations generate all kinds of data – structured, unstructured, relational, and geospatial, to name a few. Too often organizations approach each type of data differently and separately, which replicates the problem of unconnected data that doesn’t come together in one holistic picture.</p>
  <p>Select a platform with data capabilities that can analyze and knit together these different types into a unified whole. Businesses need a modern platform that treats data as multimodal and multidimensional. By looking at the multiple facets of data, business leaders can make new correlations that help to make better decisions while accurately anticipating future opportunities and threats.</p>

  <p>The real power of data kicks in when you can use it to drive automation and machine-augmented decision-making. There’s no reason to maintain so many manual processes, like invoice reconciliation or handling basic customer complaints in call centers. If you can harness data appropriately, many types of tasks can be automated – freeing employees to do more strategic work.</p>
  <p>Automation also augments employees’ on-the-spot decision-making capabilities. For example, a consumer packaged goods company could use data from cameras and machines to help a quality control manager determine whether to approve a certain batch of products. <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-machine-learning/">Machine learning</a> can process varied pieces of information, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) data or bill-of-material changes, faster than a human, providing an extra level of support on the front lines.</p>
  <p>To advance automation, you need a platform that allows you to embed machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) into your business applications – and one that can handle varied data sources in real-time.</p>
  <h2 id="democratize-data">Democratize Data</h2>
  <p>While data used to be the preserve of elite analysts and data scientists, now it’s a priority to democratize data. Information needs to be easily accessed not just by executives but by people on the front lines so they can use it to make decisions. Enabling self-service access to data also reduces the time IT departments spend on manual work, like running reports.</p>
  <p>Your platform must make it easy for everyone to access and analyze data, so be sure to evaluate the usability of your data management solutions. Ask questions such as: Is it user-friendly and intuitive? What kind of training is involved to empower people with self-service analytics tools?</p>
  <h2 id="protect-your-data">Protect Your Data</h2>
  <p>Related to access is the importance of security. One of the hallmarks of digital business is the ability to seamlessly connect across your organization but also externally to your customers, partners, and suppliers. But this is fraught with risk – especially in this day and age of ransomware.</p>
  <p>Your data platform must take into account any areas of exposure or vulnerability and build in the right security, access controls, and governance to protect your data – and information shared across your network.</p>
  <p>Finally, remember how you use your data will make the difference between success and failure in the next decade. It’s the foundation of digital transformation and will help launch new digital business models that go beyond automation – and truly redefine how companies operate and differentiate themselves. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> provides a platform with database and data management, analytics, and intelligent technology – like embedded AI – solutions that customers around the world are already using.</p>
  <p>So choose wisely. Because with the right platform, your company will be poised for success now and in the future.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>In a world struggling to recover from <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-technologies.html">intelligent technologies</a> like the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming supply chain logistics and quality assurance for groundbreaking innovations. Indian-based startup <a href="https://www.tagbox.co/">Tagbox</a> has developed a cloud solution that dynamically tracks shipments on the move.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>IoT-based sensors capture the temperature and other critical parameters of products in real time, using machine learning and AI algorithms to automatically send alerts about risk anomalies so people can take corrective action and head off damages.</p>
  <p>“Our vision is to make supply chains more holistically intelligent for greater reliability and resiliency,” said Adarsh Kumar, co-founder and CEO of Tagbox. “Organizations have full visibility into shipment risks like shocks, temperature changes, tampering, or pilferage at any point along the supply chain. Our technology shares that data to the cloud, sends shipment risk alerts to relevant stakeholders, and logs data into the ERP system. People can immediately see when something’s gone wrong and take fast action.”</p>
  <p>Most Tagbox customers are located in India, but the startup is gaining traction with organizations in other parts of Asia-Pacific, including Singapore.</p>

  <h2 id="automated-triggers-for-quality-control">Automated Triggers for Quality Control</h2>
  <p>Traditional supply chain quality management was typically one dimensional and tracked shipment risk post-delivery. In contrast, Tagbox’s technology monitors products at every step of the journey with small battery-powered sensors attached to product packaging by individual SKU, box, or pallet. Hosted on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, the tool uses SAP Internet of Things (SAP IoT) and is integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/india/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP ERP</a>. Data sharing includes product or order information with designated employees in order management, transportation and logistics, quality parameters, warehouse and inventory metrics, and first to last mile delivery.</p>
  <p>For example, after downloading a mobile app, a delivery person driving a refrigerated truck transporting medication would be alerted to temperature changes in the vehicle and receive recommended actions to prevent spoilage.</p>
  <p>“People can immediately intervene when they’re notified of a temperature change or other risk, while managers can spot systemic issues and address those,” said Kumar. “Reports reveal patterns, such as where temperature excursions happen regularly. The company may decide to improve product packaging or select different transportation routes.”</p>
  <p>One pharmaceutical customer saved thousands of dollars by reducing post-delivery assessment times by up to 72 hours. Having collected real-time data throughout the shipping process, the company eliminated time-consuming reports after delivery.</p>
  <h2 id="business-growth-from-sap-partnership">Business Growth from SAP Partnership</h2>
  <p>Kumar credited his company’s recent growth partly to his team’s experience at SAP Startup Studio, an accelerator program at <a href="https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html">SAP Labs India</a> for early- and growth-stage tech startups.</p>
  <p>“Our IoT sensors collect and send data to supply chain, SAP IoT, and other SAP ERP systems that provide the business context for product shipments and locations, making this an ideal partnership,” he said. “We’ve accelerated our time-to-market because SAP experts have provided us with industry-specific opportunity guidance and introductions to a wide range of SAP customers.”</p>

  <p>While pharmaceutical companies are obvious candidates for fully traceable quality control of vaccine and other medicine cold chains, numerous industries can also benefit from real-time insights. These include food and beverage companies and consumer electronics. One e-commerce grocery company using Tagbox improved its cold chain temperature compliance while reducing missing inventory rates by 20%.</p>
  <p>“They have end-to-end traceability of real-time temperatures for products like meats and dairy products from warehouse to consumer,” said Kumar. “They can track what percentage of orders were delivered at the right temperatures, cascading to employee performance metrics and training, as well as infrastructure and other supply chain decisions.”</p>
  <p>Appliance, home electronic, and glass manufacturers have also found benefits from Tagbox when it comes to product damage prevention during transport.</p>
  <p>“Any combination of factors can damage fragile goods on the road, whether it’s bad driving and accidents or because products weren’t packaged or loaded properly,” said Kumar. “With our sensors, companies can see precisely what kind of shock happened and when it occurred. Our algorithms translate the data into meaningful metrics such as if the product was in freefall, turned upside down, tilted, or unsecured. In the moment, they can repack the item, adjust the temperature, and keep going without damage.”</p>
  <h2 id="turning-data-into-business-value">Turning Data into Business Value</h2>
  <p>Kumar, Saumitra Singh, and Sameer Singh co-founded Tagbox, drawing from 25 years of collective experience in IoT, data analytics, AI, and integrated circuit and chip design.</p>
  <p>“We realized that despite all the talk about IoT as a data generator, there wasn’t enough focus on using that data for concrete business decisions,” he said. “We wanted to tackle supply chain inefficiencies and product quality control for high-value, fragile goods traveling across cold chains. There are so many diversification opportunities in B2B operations using IoT and machine learning.”</p>
  <p>Kumar said future international expansion plans for Tagbox included the United States, providing dynamic intelligence for supply chains worldwide, long after the pandemic recedes.</p>

    <div>
      <div>The quest for improvement and innovation to build productivity, drive greater value, and seek opportunities in new markets is perpetual for every successful business. As a result, executives and organizational leaders alike continuously evaluate their business models, offerings, and operational processes to gain any advantage they can find, especially when their products become increasingly commoditized.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Based on current research, servitization appears to be an effective antidote against the ease of product switching. McKinsey &#x26; Company <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/aftermarket-services-the-near-term-growth-opportunity-in-targeting-the-right-customers">reports</a> that while margins on new product sales are typically 10%, aftermarket service margins average 25%.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-servitization">What Is Servitization?</h2>
  <p>Servitization is a strategy that product-oriented companies use to enhance and differentiate their competitiveness by integrating services into their overall business model. This shift can be seen on a continuum in which producing and selling products is coupled with a focus on adding services to the offering and ultimately integrating them. Very quickly, customer value moves from owning and using the product to capturing value with the product while services are perceived as a cost factor.</p>
  <p>While this concept is not new, widespread <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/8/2957/htm">adoption of intelligent technology</a> – such as <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-iot-internet-of-things/">the Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-machine-learning/">machine learning</a>, and <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-predictive-analytics/">predictive analytics</a> – is fueling this approach to break into new markets and fulfill underserved customer needs. More recent product-service <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bse.414">servitization models</a> may include bundled support services, consumption or pay-for-use, and outcome-based services.</p>
  <p>An earlier form of servitization emerged in 1962 when <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases-archive/yr-2012/121030-the-hour.aspx">Rolls-Royce</a> pioneered its famous “Power by the Hour” engine maintenance service concept. This model allowed airlines to pay for the time spent maintaining and replacing their aircraft engine. As technology advanced, sensors were incorporated for engine-condition monitoring and predictive maintenance services.</p>
  <p>A few decades later, tire manufacturer Michelin redefined the service-oriented model to help trucking companies reduce fuel consumption. Payment for the service is based on achieving predefined fuel consumption targets, tracked through telematics and IoT, and assessed in real time with data analytics.</p>
  <p>Many more companies have followed Rolls-Royce’s and Michelin’s example, including <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2019-11-sap-leonardo-customer-success/book/index.html?chapter=20">Kaeser Kompressoren</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2020/01/10/learn-how-to-obtain-a-superior-b2b-customer-experience-with-these-valuable-insights/?sh=3f981bdd7777">Grundfos</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/09/50b8398d-b27d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Tetra Pak</a>. It is noted that in all cases, IT – specifically IoT and <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-industry-4-0/">Industry 4.0</a> – <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311206173_The_servitization_of_industry_EU_law_implications_and_challenges">plays a significant role</a> in enabling product-service servitization.</p>
  <p>Over time, this approach has become a critical component of manufacturers’ growth strategies. In fact, a <a href="https://www.paconsulting.com/globalassets/downloads/servitization-report.pdf">survey</a> of 60 European industrial manufacturing firms reported that servitization increases average growth margin from services delivered ranging between 15% and 35%.

  <p>Regardless of the advantages servitization offers, many businesses still question how to best recognize and adopt appropriate service options that deliver the best value to the customer. Some of the challenges encountered include culture change, competency adoption, process, system creation, and commercialization.</p>
  <p>In many ways, a transformation journey toward servitization includes four fundamental maturity stages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Splintered:</strong> The organization struggles under a myriad of silos that lead to disjointed, manual processes. Legacy, fragmented enterprise resource planning (ERP) environments provide little or no visibility on operational performance. The business model is on pure product, with challenges to profitability.</li>
    <li><strong>Side car:</strong> The organization has standardized the two chunks of the value chain – back and front desk – but keeps them separated. Since efficiency is critical at this stage, few add-on services are delivered, field services are based on basic mobile capabilities, and IoT stacks are only proofs of concept.</li>
    <li><strong>Joined up:</strong> Front- and back-office flows are integrated bidirectionally and leverage advanced technologies, such as IoT, to feed core systems with real-time data. In some cases, edge capabilities bring coordinated autonomy to local sites, a suite of digital services are made fully available, and business model enhancements including pay-as-you-use and outcome-based contracts are actively explored.</li>
    <li><strong>Borderless:</strong> Processes start and end outside the organization and operations, while technology enables different elements of the value chain to connect. Co-creation, data-sharing, and collaboration with customers, suppliers, partners from other sectors, and even competitors are part of the business model.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After demonstrating the importance of servitization during existing economic conditions and business performance, appropriate servitization concepts steadily replace the status quo, closing the gap between strategic intent and realized goals.</p>
  <p>A critical part of progressing servitization maturity is transforming the business culture to encourage leaders and employees to <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09564230310474138/full/html">shift their perception</a> of services from add-ons or giveaways to a valued part of the business model.</p>
  <p>According to Guido Schlief, senior vice president and head of Services in Middle and Eastern Europe at SAP, “Our observation is that customers increasingly expect business outcomes from their suppliers – outcome-based services are a clear industry trend.”</p>
  <p>Successfully embracing this shift can have a significant effect on the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225473204_Exploring_the_financial_consequences_of_the_servitization_of_manufacturing">profitability</a> of a servitized business. Deep insights into customer needs are required to design value-added services that are valuable from the market perspective, not from the supplier side. For example, although monitoring of equipment condition has limited value to the customer, equipment availability directly impacts the customer experience.</p>
  <p>Product companies must also consider a servitization model that shifts upfront transactional sales and payments to long-term contracts with perpetual payments, enabling customer-centric relationship building. <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09564230310474138/full/html">Successful delivery of this approach</a> demands an effective services organization, resembling a professional services firm containing the right processes, tools, and personnel who possess specialized skills. Although service personnel typically <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225473204_Exploring_the_financial_consequences_of_the_servitization_of_manufacturing">cost</a> more than manufacturing personnel, the investment can help <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/8/2957/htm">overcome critical hurdles</a>, such as lack of knowledge in systematic transformation and the ability to make required changes, in gaining the full benefit of servitization.</p>

  <p>Over time, the transformation into a servitization model can be assessed to help ensure it satisfies the core needs of the business: financial, internal, customers, innovation, and learning. For example, pure financial measures – such as service revenue growth or services market share – can be <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322834491_Measuring_servitization_progress_and_outcome_the_case_of_&#x27;advanced_services&#x27;">evaluated</a> alongside a proposed a balanced scorecard to provide a comprehensive view on servitization performance (See Figure 1).</p>
  <h2 id="get-ready-servitization-is-here-to-stay">Get Ready: Servitization Is Here to Stay</h2>
  <p>As customers gain less interest in the shiny new functionalities of new products and pay more attention to the outcomes they achieve, all signs point to the growing importance of services as a competitive differentiator.</p>
  <p>But remember, servitization is more than a pure vertical integration of the business model and goes far beyond add-on or giveaway services. In essence, it is a strategic transformation that spans across most business silos, requiring alignment between the business and IT and between the front and back office of the supplier.</p>
  <p>And if approached appropriately, the new business model can open new sources of revenue and bring a fundamental shift from a reactive break-fix mentality to proactive outcome-based services.</p>
