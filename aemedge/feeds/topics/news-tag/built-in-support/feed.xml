    <div>
      <div>Last year was full of upheaval for businesses across the globe: the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> continued to disrupt global commerce while also spurring incredible technological innovation and rapid adoption. Indeed, consulting firm McKinsey now <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/technology-trends-2021-mckinsey/">predicts</a> that we will see more technological progress in the coming decade than we saw in the last century combined.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As digital transformation became ever more critical to enterprises around the world, <a href="/topics/support">SAP Services and Support</a> took a leading role in helping clients to avoid disruption and maintain critical functions and infrastructure. This steady hand through troubled times did not go unnoticed. “I’m hearing from customers that they are a combination of relieved and impressed that we didn’t let them down and really upheld our operations,” said Andreas Heckmann, executive vice president and head of Customer Solution Support and Innovation at SAP. “There was no disruption whatsoever, quite the opposite since we reached historical highs in customer satisfaction in recent quarters.”</p>
  <p>Here, Heckmann discusses the lessons learned last year and his goals for customer support in 2022 and beyond, including everything from the future of <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_1255553798">Built-In Support</a> to new breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) to why this is the “biggest moment of transformation” that support has ever seen.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: What are you most excited about for support in the year ahead?</strong></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>A:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say the biggest transformation in support’s history will commence in 2022. For one thing, we will further harmonize our acquisitions, working on infrastructure and joint “next practices” so that our customers have an even more streamlined experience. It will truly be <em>one</em> SAP. Machine learning has advanced substantially, and we are now set to provide some of the greatest innovations imaginable. Also, support will become much more prescriptive. Along the entire solution life cycle, we want to answer the question, ‘What’s the client’s best option here?’</p>
  <p>We’ve been super successful in 2021 with advancing SAP Cloud ALM. It’s evolved wonderfully and ahead of schedule, so now we want to start offering it to customers as a default – right from the very first project. Then they’ll continue with data migration, handing over to operations, doing optimization, monitoring, and things like that.</p>
  <p>I’m very excited that in 2022 we will start moving all these pieces of the puzzle together to create a fully integrated, end-to-end experience. During the entire customer life cycle, we will be able to take customers by the hand better than we’ve ever done before and offer a lot of technology on top of our already great customer service.</p>
  <p><strong>Why are these changes happening now?</strong></p>
  <p>It’s definitely driven by customer insights. We are focusing on the things that we know customers are struggling with most, and we are thinking of the different personas we are now interacting with through support. Years ago, we mostly dealt with IT departments – with SAP competence centers. And while they are still there, the mix is changing fast. We see a lot more business users. They have very different expectations on how they want to interact. They’re not very technical. They don’t want clumsy user interfaces (UI).</p>
  <p>We want to provide them with the best possible, consumer-grade experience – a really delightful experience. And yes, evolving technology helps us with that, for sure. It’s a lot easier for us to do it now than it was five years ago. But the impetus comes from meeting customer needs, not using technology for its own sake.</p>
  <p>We’re entering a fundamentally different game now. In the past, it was a finite game. Now, with the cloud, we are finding ourselves in an infinite game. We have to win our customers time and again, and their life cycle keeps repeating itself. So mainly what we’re trying to do now is meet all these customer requirements by anticipating the needs that we encounter ourselves.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Can you share a little bit about why you’re excited about Built-In Support in 2022?</strong></p>
  <p>I’m very excited about this service right now. In the past, if a user had a question or ran into a problem, they would have to leave the space they work in completely and open a different portal. Then they would need to authenticate, choose the type of problem they’re experiencing, and work their way through the process.</p>
  <p>This process was good for us. But it wasn’t necessarily providing the best customer experience. I would say that the most intuitive experience would be if you’re experiencing a problem, you shouldn’t have to tell us where the problem is, right? If you are right there working, then we can take the context of your working environment with no effort from you. It should be an integrated UI and it should support you seamlessly, starting a meaningful dialogue right there on the spot. That is the vision we had for Built-In Support. It took several attempts to optimize it, but today it is an absolutely beautiful, lightweight UI. It’s like a little helper that flies in over your software.</p>
  <p>And another good thing is that it’s technically not part of the product code. We created it this way because we wanted to provide a unified experience – the exact same thing should happen no matter what solution you use. So, we developed a tool outside of the products and made it very easy for our development units to integrate this support tool with local integration. That way, they can focus 100% on developing the actual product, and we can focus 100% on developing all the supporting functions. I think that’s quite revolutionary. I’m not aware anyone else is doing that. I think we get the best of all worlds.</p>
  <p><strong>How have AI and machine learning become more integral to support processes?</strong></p>
  <p>We now have a very potent data lake with a lot of detailed information and with that, we are able to do a lot more complex AI and machine learning. And we are also technologically capable of responding in a split second to things that are happening. The use cases we are working on right now are to help us become truly predictive. I’ll give you an example. If we see a customer encounter a problem, and we see a second customer sending a problem that pretty much sounds the same, and then another, and another, we automatically detect the pattern. Then we can easily identify what other customers have the same criteria and will encounter the same problem, thereby stopping it before it occurs. Once we identify them, we can be truly proactive by going to the customer before they come to us.</p>
  <p>If the problem is within our control, we could enter into a world that is typically described as self-healing. In other words, we could make all the corrections as soon as we detect the pattern, so that the customer will never even know that they were about to experience a problem.</p>
  <p><strong>What’s your greatest hope for 2022?</strong></p>
  <p>My number one priority for the year is getting this vision on the road. And it’s going to take us a few years to complete all of these ambitious goals. But this year, I want to have the groundwork done. I want to have early successes; I want to make it tangible for our first customers. That’s by far my number one wish.</p>

    <div>
      <div>For many companies, moving to the <strong>cloud is the “next normal”</strong> in business environments. It’s not about “if” anymore – it’s about “when” and “how.” This trend has dominated discussions in the enterprise technology space for a long time and has been further accelerated by <a href="/covid-19">the global pandemic</a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In a <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3611419/cios-say-public-cloud-migration-is-essential-for-survival.html">recent survey</a> of U.S.-based CIOs, 85% of respondents said that moving to the cloud was the foundation for a future-ready enterprise, enabling improved productivity and providing the speed and flexibility businesses need to respond quickly to changing conditions. The more insecure environments get – and the pandemic, climate change, and many other elements today contribute strongly to insecurity – the more cloud benefits like flexibility and less bundled commitments to technology will play a role.</p>
  <p>Moving to the cloud is not like flipping a switch. Having built up extensive and customized on-premise hardware and software landscapes over time, many companies will need time to move their business processes to a cloud-based environment, especially taking into account the more standardized nature of software as a service (SaaS). This will result in having many different software deployment and consumption models: some will be public cloud, some private cloud or on hyperscalers, some staying on-premise at least in the mid-term. Despite such mixed IT landscapes, customers expect a seamless end-to-end experience from their vendor – especially in support.</p>
  <p>At SAP, this expectation is nothing new. In fact, this has always been core to our support strategy. Even before the days of cloud, SAP strove to offer a comprehensive set of business solutions tightly integrated for end-to-end business processes, with seamless experiences on user interfaces, data, and support. This core principle still fits perfectly in the cloud world and provides enormous opportunity for customer value in landscapes that are hybrid or in transition.</p>
  <p>So, what does end-to-end support mean? At SAP, this is about having a <strong>unified approach to all aspects of support</strong>. The goal is one feature-rich, foundational support offering, one customer-facing support interface, one support infrastructure, and one support organization that maintains a strong global culture of service and expertise.</p>

      <div><strong><a href="https://me.sap.com/">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Currently, SAP solutions are accompanied by our flagship support offering <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/enterprise-support.html">SAP Enterprise Support</a>, which is embedded in cloud subscriptions and is the offering of choice for on-premise SAP software solutions. This can provide our customers with the confidence that they will receive the same high-quality of support for their entire landscape, no matter the SAP solution they happen to be using at any given moment. We understand that one end-to-end business process might touch several systems and SAP software solutions and, therefore, a support issue will not exist in a vacuum of a single product only. We have the expertise and culture of collaboration to look at problems holistically across an integrated SAP environment.</p>
  <p>Here are some recent <strong>examples of our continued expansion of customer value</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In 2020 we launched <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm.html">SAP Cloud ALM</a>, SAP’s next-generation <strong>cloud-based application lifecycle management solution</strong> that includes best practices and mechanisms to manage and monitor integrated landscapes, not siloed by specific products. Developed to support the implementation and operation of SAP solutions, it is continually expanding its coverage of cloud and on-premise deployments.</li>
    <li>We are always striving to find new ways of making access to support easier for our customers. In 2020, SAP launched a new <strong>unified “digital front door”</strong> called <a href="https://me.sap.com/">SAP for Me</a>. The vision for this personalized portal is that customers and partners can access all information, insights, and tasks related to SAP. During the next year, many more support-related tasks and reports will also be made available on SAP for Me to help give customers an end-to-end view of their SAP assets, services, interactions, and more.</li>
    <li>In the last few years, we have introduced new ways for customers to get <strong>direct access to support experts and managers</strong>. It started with <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_519294480">Expert Chat</a> – here, SAP has recently delivered the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sap-customers-get-on-the-spot-support-million-times-heckmann">1,000,000th on-the-spot support</a>. Customers can start a chat directly with a technical support engineer or <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_1575600800">schedule a meeting</a> at their convenience. They can even schedule a <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_193743618">meeting with a support manager</a>.</li>
    <li>Sometimes it’s even better if you can <strong>get a solution automatically</strong>. As you would expect from an industry leader, SAP is exploring the next frontier of support innovation: artificial intelligence (AI). For example, the <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_1903672625">Incident Solution Matching</a> service analyzes a customer’s problem description while they are typing it into the support case and suggests potential solutions. <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_1255553798">Built-In Support</a>, with its digital support assistant, is already available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and will be integrated into more products in time. We have launched the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/27/machine-translation-integration-to-last-communication-from-sap-support-for-customer-incidents">automatic translation of the last incident</a> and support assets like <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/03/07/self-service-machine-translation-for-sap-notes-and-knowledge-base-articles-in-the-sap-one-support-launchpad/">SAP Notes or a SAP Knowledge Base Article</a>. And artificial intelligence can also help spot problems before they occur and provide recommendations to prevent future issues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Through it all, SAP provides the <strong>flexibility</strong> customers need to make the most of their business while saving time and resources. Whether a company is moving to the public cloud, balancing cloud and on-premise solutions, or just exploring cloud elements at its edges, we can provide the support it needs to be agile and resilient in today’s markets.</p>
  <p>The next generation of support is the baseline. It is seamless, end-to-end, proactive, multi-channeled, and intelligent in order to let our customers focus on what matters most to them: driving their business.</p>

      </div>
      <div><strong><a href="SAP%20Allows%20Customers%20to%20Access%20Support%20Easily%20and%20Without%20Disruption%20">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Whereas once technical knowledge and rapid response were all that mattered to support users, that is now table stakes. Today, users from diverse parts of a customer’s company need to be able to access and understand support quickly and easily, changing the goals for what a support session should look like.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That is why today, SAP is using innovative functions enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time support with <a href="/topics/built-in-support">cutting-edge Built-In Support</a>, built directly into the application, to provide customers with a rapid and intuitive experience that is paving the way for increasingly predictive and preventative support.</p>
  <p>“Today, user experience matters more than ever in the support context. Users expect a seamless end-to-end customer experience, and we are committed to providing it to them by offering connected and holistic support,” said Andreas Heckmann, executive vice president and head of Customer Solution Support and Innovation at SAP. “This means meeting the customer inside the application with contextually aware features.”</p>
  <p>This innovative customer experience leverages AI and machine learning to deliver intuitive experiences that users have come to expect from consumer applications, but with the full might of SAP’s engineering powering the interaction behind the scenes.</p>
  <p>Here, Heckmann goes deeper on how these innovations came to be and how they can show us the future of support.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: There has recently been an evolution in Built-In Support as part of SAP’s Next-Generation Support approach. Could you tell us about what’s changed?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Built-In Support, which means support that is available within the application, has been substantially enhanced recently, including a complete re-platforming, making it a lot more feature-rich by adding AI functions and real-time chats. That means customers don’t have to leave the application to experience these cutting-edge innovations; it’s all right there for them, and it’s contextualized because we know where they are in the application. So if you ask to chat with an expert inside the application, it won’t take you to some unrelated person. The AI system will know what type of question you probably have.</p>
  <p><strong>How does Built-In Support impact user experience, and why is user experience (UX) or user interface (UI) so important today?</strong></p>
  <p>With Built-In Support, I can now interact with support the same way I interact with my smartphone as a consumer. Normally when I’m using my smartphone, I have an expectation that everything is there on the spot, easy, intuitive, fast. That’s what Built-In Support feels like to the user.</p>
  <p>In the past, we in support mostly interacted with IT departments, which were filled with very experienced IT professionals. For them, clumsy UI wasn’t much of a problem. Nowadays, we are interacting with business users from any line of business more and more. And those users increasingly belong to an age group that consists of “digital natives,” hence having an entirely different expectation on user interface and experience. To meet all our users on eye level and provide them with the same consumer-grade experience, we invented a solution like Built-In Support, making it easy and seamless to engage with product support, no matter if you are an IT expert or an expert in your specific line of business. Our sophisticated technology is designed to back this all up.</p>

  </div>
  <p><strong>With AI and machine learning helping to simplify, improve, and accelerate processes and workflows — just to mention a few advantages — what is unique in how SAP employs AI?</strong></p>
  <p>Today, already every single one of the interactions we have with customers is monitored, processed, and analyzed by our AI system because we embedded it in our incident management process. That means that customers are typing away and describing their problem and we are analyzing the likely cause in real time. They don’t even have to press a button or activate something. They just go through the normal process like they always did. That’s pretty unique because SAP is not a one product company, not a 10-product company, but a hundreds-of-products company. In that context, being able to give answers very, very precisely and to be right most of the time, that’s quite unique in the industry, and we were only able to get there by developing several of our own algorithms to work seamlessly with our proprietary systems and data.</p>
  <p><strong>Did your team encounter setbacks as you established this AI program?</strong></p>
  <p>To be honest, more things didn’t work out than did work out. When we first began using AI, we thought it would be relatively easy, just applying some algorithms. It didn’t work at all. We learned the hard way that because of the many products we have and because many different technical terms employ the same words but sometimes with different meanings, traditional approaches to AI didn’t work for us.</p>
  <p>Take, for example, the word “transport.” What does transport mean? We have a logistics system, and within that, if a customer discusses a transport, she is probably referring to transporting items on a truck, on a ship, or on a plane. But it could also mean the transport of a piece of software from one system to another, because we have software transport systems as well. It could refer to moving data or it could refer to moving people.</p>
  <p>That was the nut we had to crack. And we had to learn that AI is always made for the data you are using. At the very beginning, I didn’t get AI. I looked at it more like a search engine, a better search engine with a smarter filter, but that’s completely wrong. For any type of data and every use case you must build your algorithm and then you must train your algorithm. You must find the patterns within. Each situation is somewhat unique. That’s the biggest lesson we learned.</p>
  <p><strong>How have AI and other emerging technologies paved the way for predictive support?</strong></p>
  <p>AI is a bit like a key ingredient that we need to prepare the meal, which is predictive support. All the things we’ve been discussing — real-time support, AI, and so on — all of it is the innovation that brought us to the current status quo. So why do we already regard this as the old world? Because the customer is still experiencing the problem, and we are just getting much better, faster, and more creative in how we respond.</p>
  <p>What we are trying to do now and for the time to come is combine real-time support and AI and other innovations to find the problem before the customer even knows they have it. Say a customer reports a problem, and then another customer reports that same problem, a short time after, and maybe a third customer reports the problem. Today, we will automatically detect that and conclude, “Hey, something’s happening. We have three customers reporting this type of problem. What can we learn?” And we look automatically at these customers and discover they are all using a specific functionality in a specific configuration. And in that constellation, they are running into that problem. Then we can automatically determine which other customers have that module, use it in that very specific constellation and solve the problem for them before it even occurs, and provide a predictive and preventative service to help those customers before they even experience the problem.</p>

      <div>Not all support experiences are created the same. In fact, some can be described as unproductive, unnecessarily frustrating, complex, and slow. Business and key users must stay focused on their business tasks, which is even more important when users need help to keep their business applications running.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Embedded in business applications, Built-In Support provides direct access to support channels, knowledge, and expertise in ways that are relevant, seamless, context-aware, and, most importantly, productive.</p>
  <p>Think about your last support experience when using an application at work. Perhaps you submitted an IT ticket into the company portal, visited a provider’s information site, interacted with multiple support experts, or engaged with a chatbot to find answers to your questions. Whatever the method, it was likely a complex interaction that might have lacked relevance, speed, and a satisfactory solution from a user point of view.</p>
  <p>It is unlikely for most of us to achieve deep focus while continually switching back and forth between different types of tasks, which usually span across multiple systems and user experiences. In the case of support interactions, one major challenge is how to collect, prepare, and transfer relevant, contextual information into the appropriate support channel. To perform your challenging business tasks optimally, you need to reach <a href="https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-father-of-flow/">a state of flow</a>, where you give your complete attention to your main activity while having everything else available in a sidecar that is seamlessly integrated and easily accessible.</p>
  <p>When support is extended and integrated throughout an application, users can get the help they need without having to leave the application, efficiently solving issues or answering questions much faster. And best of all, with more preventative support features accessible over time, they might not even have to ask questions, instead receiving trending information proactively on certain topics.</p>
  <p>Does it sound too good to be true? Not for businesses that have adopted cloud solutions from SAP, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Over time, more and more cloud solutions from <a href="/2021/05/built-in-support-easy-access-without-disruption">SAP will integrate Built-In Support</a>.</p>

  <p>When considering new software, self-assist support services are inevitably listed as a key feature. However, those options are rarely sophisticated enough to guide users to a viable resolution quickly. The majority provide basic field definitions and instructions, a search for product documentation, or a basic ticketing submission process.</p>
  <p>Most users require a more responsive, proactive, and predictive support experience – whether they are a new employee learning how to use a new technology or a seasoned expert encountering a problem. Furthermore, all these capabilities must be accessible within the application without switching systems and impacting productivity and performance.</p>
  <p>With an advanced version of Built-In Support, users no longer need the integration of Built-In Support via SAP CoPilot; they can acquire the guidance necessary to optimize the value of our suite of intelligent and cloud-based solutions. This approach simplifies the integration of a combination of support services into any SAP Web-based user interface that users can access with a click of a button.</p>
  <p>The Built-In Support approach includes a wide range of support services, such as:</p>
  <p><strong>Self-Service and Incident Prevention</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>SAP documentation, SAP Knowledge Base Articles, and many more information sources can be accessed directly from within Built-In Support.</li>
    <li>Structured decision trees can be leveraged to find technical answers or to enrich contextual issue description with business process-related information.</li>
    <li>You can get artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled solution recommendations of incident solutions matched with similar support incidents or requests.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Real-Time Interaction</strong></p>
  <p>For fast incident resolution and prevention, users can obtain help directly from SAP support experts through the seamless integration of Expert Chat.</p>
  <p><strong>Personalized, Context-Sensitive Support</strong></p>
  <p>In Built-In Support, every interaction is context aware. This means the technical information of your underlying business application is known and used to provide the best-fit content, solution proposals, chatbot conversation, or support channel. Just think of how much time you can save by knowing exactly where to get the information that can help prioritize and resolve your problem.</p>

  <p>One of the most significant advantages of relying on SAP support services is the wide variety of channels. But when all those formats are accessible in the application being used and automated to deliver the right assistance, users can gain an edge in their work performance. Furthermore, this approach works to further incentivize and accelerate long-term user adoption.</p>
  <p>Now couldn’t be a better time to take advantage of such a comprehensive digital support approach. As executives take a quantum leap in digitalization to get their businesses back on track, employees can be well-positioned to embrace new technology confidently, productively, and successfully.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced it has integrated advanced support into its solutions to deliver the intuitive experience modern business users need. With artificial intelligence and machine learning, the Built-In Support concept from SAP moves support directly into the application, simplifying and accelerating customer interaction with an embedded, contextually aware digital support assistant.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To meet customers wherever they are, Built-In Support has driven the delivery of cutting-edge tools and access to live support from experts in fewer steps, helping to improve business outcomes and increase value for SAP customers.</p>
  <p>“Our overarching goal is to make support not only effortless but also available how and where customers want it – within the application – and contextually aware of their needs,” said Andreas Heckmann, executive vice president and head, Customer Solution Support &#x26; Innovation, SAP SE. “Just as the RISE with SAP package brings together everything you need to transform your business in the cloud that works best for the customer, SAP now offers a matching intuitive, connected and holistic support experience that helps make it easy for businesses to improve operational reliability and efficiency.”</p>
  <p>This innovative customer experience leverages AI and machine learning to deliver the intuitive experiences that users have come to expect from smart phones but with the full might of SAP’s engineering powering the interaction behind the scenes. With the latest advances, the intelligent, customized support SAP has been pioneering for years with enterprise software now provides an easy-to-engage consumer-grade experience for customers.</p>

  <p>Based on the Built-In Support approach, an embedded, contextually aware digital support assistant is currently available for SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Following the Built-In Support approach, contextually aware digital support will soon be embedded in additional solutions, including the SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain and SAP Cloud ALM solutions.</p>
  <p>Key features of the contextually aware embedded support include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Intelligent search and the Incident Solution Matching service</strong>: These features answer users’ questions faster using an intelligent search feature that knows where the customer is and automatically suggests personalized solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Expert Chat service</strong>: Without leaving the application, users can easily initiate a chat session using the Expert Chat service to contact a domain expert who can help solve issues much faster.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thanks to historical data of past usage, preventative services are inching closer to reality. By analyzing performance and error data, cloud health redefines traditional monitoring and enables preventative action, helping businesses avoid costly disruptions and time-consuming incidents. These advances have helped move SAP one step closer to offering fully predictive support that can anticipate and solve a problem before it occurs.</p>
  <h2 id="effortless-interaction">Effortless Interaction</h2>
  <p>Today’s users are often not the IT experts of yesteryear. Any user may need support, and they increasingly are expecting to access prompt and proper support without leaving the application. This kind of in-context support helps reduce disruptions and costly downtime and improve efficiency, while providing a much more intuitive and streamlined support experience.</p>
  <h2 id="keep-up-customers-business-continuity">Keep Up Customers’ Business Continuity</h2>
  <p>SAP Cloud ALM has already been included in a subscription for SAP S/4HANA Cloud and is one of the key components of the RISE with SAP program. The application lifecycle management capabilities provided by SAP Cloud ALM help customers implement SAP S/4HANA Cloud quickly and standardize its operations for increased efficiency.</p>
  <p>These new solutions and tools are part of the next generation of support technology and customer experience, available now from SAP.</p>
