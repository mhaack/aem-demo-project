      <div><strong>Whatâs News</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Drought conditions in much of North America and Europe are resulting in water restrictions and extremely low water levels in many rivers threaten transportation of supplies. Europe has been particularly hard hit during a summer of record temperatures and months of below-average rainfall.</p>
  <p>Two major river arteries â the Danube and the Rhine â have already become almost impassible in some places. This is threatening transportation of grain and other commodities on the 1,800-mile Danube, which flows into the Black Sea. Also impacted are supplies of coal and diesel fuel carried by barge on the Rhine that are essential to the economies of Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p>

  <h2 id="saps-take">SAPâs Take</h2>
  <p>Low water levels in Europeâs main navigable rivers threaten to exacerbate the supply chain problems already caused by the <a href="/topics/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic and the war in Ukraine.</p>
  <p>As Richard Howells, a <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm.html">supply chain</a> expert at SAP, noted, the ships and barges traveling down the Rhine are essential modes of transport for shipping products and materials through western Europe, and Germany in particular. It is estimated that 80% of Germanyâs water freight is transported on the Rhine, meaning that millions of tons of goods are shipped via the river every year.</p>
  <p>âTransporting goods is a 24/7, 365 day-a-year operation, requiring coordination and collaboration between multiple entities,â Howells said. âWhen a key mode of transport â such as shipping â is disrupted by low river levels, it becomes a logistical nightmare.â</p>
  <p>Either more vessels carrying lighter loads must be used so that they will sit higher in the water, or alternate modes of transport must be procured, usually at a higher cost. âThis will have additional knock-on effects, such as higher congestion on the roadways, with increased emissions that will impact already challenging sustainability goals,â he warns.</p>
  <p>Low river levels also have dire consequences for other forms of commerce. In the U.S., the federal government has stepped in after western states failed to reach agreements to reduce water use from the drought-plagued Colorado River, issuing cuts that will affect Nevada, Arizona and Mexico.</p>
  <p>In France, the water in the Rhone and Garonne rivers is too warm to cool some of the countryâs nuclear reactors, adding to a power crisis. And in Italy, agriculture is impacted by low water levels in the Po River, which feeds the countryâs rice fields.</p>
  <p>Pointedly, some economists fear the drought in Europe could tip a region already under stress from the war in Ukraine into recession.</p>

  <p>By 2050, according to <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/green-hydrogen/report.pdf">research by Goldman Sachs</a>, green hydrogen could supply up to 25% of the worldâs energy needs and become a â¬13 trillion (US$15 trillion) market. But until we get there, current challenges of storing and transporting hydrogen need to be overcome first.</p>

  <h2 id="not-all-hydrogen-is-created-equal">Not All Hydrogen Is Created Equal</h2>
  <p>In the long run, only CO2-free hydrogen produced with the help of renewable energies is sustainable. However, it will be quite a while before there is enough green hydrogen to meet the growing demand. The reason: there is not enough green electricity. Of the many alternative production methods, the most popular today is blue or grey hydrogen produced from natural gas.</p>
  <p>In the future, many industrial processes will use green or blue hydrogen or downstream products made from it, such as ammonia and methanol. Hydrogen can particularly help clean up emission-intensive industries like transportation, chemical iron, and steel production, which account for about 7% of global CO2 emissions each year. But the high number of potential users contrasts with the limited availability and high production costs of hydrogen.</p>

  <p>In line with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en">European Green Deal</a> to reduce emissions at least 55% by 2030 and make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, governments have adopted similar sustainability goals and consider hydrogen a critical component to reach them. <a href="/2021/05/net-zero-emissions-transformation-journey">Companies are also taking action</a> to support green and digital transformations in the EU. For instance, the <a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/about-us/newsroom/news/press-releases/european-ceo-alliance-emphasizes-cross-industry-collaboration-to-fight-climate-change-5f771e77ccf05b586c3f6508">European CEO Alliance</a> was founded by 12 executives from leading European companies to develop concrete recommendations for action and help companies undergo the green transition. This alliance is driven by the conviction that no company will solve the greatest challenges of our time alone. To succeed, companies need to collaborate across value chains, build partnerships, and work together with governments and academia.</p>
  <p>One project that has emerged from these cross-company efforts is looking at how to accelerate the complete value chain of green hydrogen â from production, transport, storage, and sale, to the energy customer. Instead of operating in silos, these market segments need to be linked together.</p>
  <h2 id="a-data-sharing-platform-as-the-single-source-of-truth">A Data-Sharing Platform as the Single Source of Truth</h2>
  <p>The first prototype of a green hydrogen platform based on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a> looks promising. The platform combines data from all participants of the hydrogen value chain and, therefore, enables better data-driven business decisions. Instead of managing complicated spreadsheets, an energy provider can use the platform as their single source of truth to run simulations and calculate how much energy they can produce, how much they want to sell to the electrolyzer, and how much power they need for vehicles, households, and industries.</p>
  <p>For such platforms to be successful, visibility across the value chain of green hydrogen is a prerequisite. Supply chain solution <a href="https://www.green-token.io/">GreenToken by SAP</a> helps companies to track hydrogen across the entire supply chain, from production to energy customer, via electrolyzers and carriers using blockchain technology. The solution is designed to provide auditable proof of what percentage of the hydrogen is green, blue, or grey. GreenToken can also be used to track <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#:~:text=3%20Emission%20Factors-,Description%20of%20Scope%203%20Emissions,impacts%20in%20its%20value%20chain.&#x26;text=Scope%203%20emission%20sources%20include,downstream%20of%20the%20organization%27s%20activities.">scope 3 CO2 emissions</a> that are caused when hydrogen is imported from far away. Companies can leverage the data to prove that their purchased hydrogen is truly green. They can also see how much CO2 has been created during the journey from production origin to customer site and, therefore, how much they would need to offset to make the hydrogen 100% green again.</p>

    <div>
      <div>As part of its long-standing and ongoing commitment to sustainability, SAP has joined the <a href="https://leafcoalition.org/">LEAF Coalition</a> (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance) in support of the fight against climate change. The announcement came during the World Leaders Summit on November 2, 2021, part of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (<a href="https://ukcop26.org/">COP26</a>).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP is <a href="/topics/cop26">an active participant</a> in the conference, which brings together government and business leaders, international organizations, and other stakeholders in a common cause to accelerate action toward combatting climate change.</p>
  <p>LEAF is a voluntary global coalition made up of private-sector businesses and governments to provide finance for tropical and subtropical forest conservation. With US$1 billion mobilized already, LEAF is on track to become one of the largest ever public-private efforts to protect tropical forests. SAP will contribute $2.2 million to the LEAF Coalition as it works to reverse deforestation in vulnerable areas and help achieve the goals of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement">Paris Agreement</a> to combat climate change. As natural carbon sinks and biodiversity treasures, forests are essential for all life on earth and play an important role in mitigating global temperature rise.</p>
  <p>âWe are committed to being part of the solution to climate change,â says Luka Mucic, CFO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. âAs we accelerate our transformation to be a net-zero company, we continually look for ways to avoid, reduce, and, if needed, compensate emissions. No company or country alone, however, will turn the tide on climate change. So, it is also our priority to collaborate. Thatâs why weâre excited to join forces and accelerate action as part of the LEAF Coalition. Weâre confident that our investment will support nature-based solutions benefitting the environment, biodiversity, and local communities.â</p>
  <p>SAP strives to be a leading example of sustainable business practices â its financial support of LEAF is just one part of the companyâs holistic efforts to fight climate change and restore ecosystems. Since 2009 SAP has aggressively pursued cuts to its own business carbon footprint with a goal of being <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">carbon neutral by the end of 2023</a> while in parallel continuing its efforts to meet a science-based target to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In addition to LEAF, SAP also supports the <a href="https://www.1t.org/">1t.org</a> initiative to conserve, restore, and grow one trillion trees by 2030. The <a href="https://www.1t.org/pledges/climate-action-and-21-million-trees-by-2025">company pledges</a> to plant 21 million trees by the end of 2025 while continuing to drive carbon-reducing innovations and pursue a science-based climate target. SAPâs efforts also include active participation in a variety of <a href="/2021/07/enhancing-sustainability-people-technology-21-million-trees">other funds and initiatives</a>.</p>
  <p>And, as a leading provider in enterprise application software, SAP is also uniquely qualified to help customers optimize their sustainability performance not only in their own company but across their entire value chain. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability.html">SAP technology</a> helps organizations measure and understand their efforts relating to climate protection, diversity and inclusion, ethical responsibility, and more.</p>
  <p>âSustainability directly links to SAPâs purpose of helping the world run better and improving peopleâs lives,â says SAP Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Schmid. âThis means creating positive economic, environmental, and social impact. To live up to this ambition, SAP provides customers with products and services that help meet their sustainability opportunities and challenges. We also lead by example and strive to be a role model for sustainable operations and investments.â</p>
  <p>In recognition of its efforts to drive innovation and action toward the creation of genuinely sustainable markets, SAP was <a href="/2021/11/sap-awarded-terra-carta-seal">recently awarded the Terra Carta Seal</a>. The seal is awarded to companies whose ambitions are aligned with those of the Terra Carta, a recovery plan for Nature, People, and Planet, by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.</p>

      <div>As the climate crisis intensifies, <a href="/2021/10/integrating-climate-action-end-to-end">SAP has made it clear</a> that the company is committed to helping its customers combat these challenges and embrace sustainable alternatives.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Enabling climate action through technology is top of mind for customers in industries around the globe, but the topic was particularly remarkable to the gathering of North American utility organizations at the annual <a href="https://events.asug.com/sapforutilities">SAP for Utilities</a> conference in San Diego on October 17-19. These are organizations that not only face the emergency environmental situations intensified by climate change, like hurricanes and fires, but are also daily witnesses to energy consumption and, increasingly, adoption of more sustainable energy sources.</p>
  <p>Itâs no surprise then that sustainability was a key track at the conference, addressing head-on the challenges that North American utilities face as they grow and innovate against the looming presence of climate change. With keynotes from world-renowned experts and boots-on-the-ground insight â 90% of the track sessions were led by customers â here are the top takeaways on how sustainability is shaping the utilities industry.</p>

  <p>While utilities have been responding to the impact of climate challenges for decades, the last few years have made the challenge acute: more intense natural disasters, the swift adoption of electric vehicles, and even the overnight shift to remote work. All of these have a significant impact on the energy grid â and when coupled with an escalation of regulation around sustainability, utilities are working under incredible market complexity.</p>
  <p>The response, from industry experts and utility managers alike, was clear: to manage these challenges, companies need to gather, track, and understand their data. And the only way to do that is through <a href="https://insights.sap.com/digitization-vs-digitalization/">digitization</a> and smart software.</p>
  <p>âThe most important thing is the ability to measure: to know where you started and where youâre going to, where the journey ends,â said Brian Roach, managing director of Regulated Industries at SAP. âWhat weâre seeing now is a lot of investment in the understanding of, say, your carbon footprint and having a predictable and consistent means of measuring that.â</p>

  <p>For the past century, the energy industry has looked more or less the same. But factors are colluding to upend that stasis, and none more so than the electric vehicle. Elon Musk recently went on record <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-elon-musk-electric-vehicle-production-51633202912">that U.S. electricity production needs to double</a> in order to power the transition to electric vehicles. That is a tall order for utilities. Itâs also an amazing opportunity to define new approaches in the ecosystem and create new business, particularly when it comes to taking advantage of off-cycle electrical demand.</p>
  <p>âThis is where smart technology must be applied: determining when you charge, what the right time of day is, what the rates are, the priorities of what gets charged first,â said Tony Posawatz, president and CEO of Invictus iCAR LLC, in the opening keynote. âThis is where some of the horsepower that exists in the industry will come to bear.â</p>
  <h2 id="the-opportunity-is-now-to-transform-the-industry">The Opportunity Is Now to Transform the Industry</h2>
  <p>Despite the clear external pressures â regulations, customer expectations and demand, the fast-evolving climate crisis â the tone was one of optimism and excitement. This is a turning point for the industry, and organizations are eager to rise to the challenge.</p>
  <p>âIâve been in this industry for decades, and for the first 10 years or so it was pretty stable; there wasnât a lot of significant change. But right now, we are in a transformative state. I see it as a huge opportunity for us to be the ones who formulate what the future of utilities looks like,â said Michael OâDonnell, regional vice president of Utilities for SAP, in the opening keynote. âFor me, it couldnât be a more exciting time. You call it disruption; I call it opportunity for us to shape this and change the future.â</p>

      <div>The race to zero carbon emissions among car manufacturers <a href="http://www.automobilsport.com/cars-tuning--37,222545,Way-to-Zero-Volkswagen-presents-roadmap-for-climate-neutral-mobility,news.htm">is in full swing</a>. Earlier this month, the worldâs largest producer, Volkswagen Group (VW), indicated it would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-electric-emissions/insight-how-low-can-you-go-volkswagen-throws-down-the-emissions-gauntlet-idUSL1N2ML25I">support more ambitious CO2 emissions targets</a>, catching European rivals off guard and putting them under pressure to follow suit.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But the race to ânet zeroâ for the automobile industry is still in the first lap, and the route promises to be long and arduous. Greenhouse gas emissions from the industry account for more than 9% of global emissions â equaling those of the entire European Union. To achieve their individual sustainability targets, companies are dependent on each other for reliable and verifiable data.</p>

  <h2 id="decarbonization-is-all-about-the-data">Decarbonization Is All About the Data</h2>
  <p>Becoming carbon neutral requires managing the carbon footprint of individual products in the supply chain, and to achieve this companies need transparency into the carbon footprints of their upstream suppliers â referred to as <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards_supporting/FAQ.pdf">scope 3 emissions</a>. The problem is that only 21% of business executives are satisfied with the quality of their environmental data, <a href="/2021/04/sustainability-study-from-sap-actions-challenges">according to a global research study from SAP</a>.</p>
  <p>But more accurate carbon footprint data is on the way. âUntil now, companies have been using averages to calculate carbon footprint at a product level because thereâs been a lack of accurate, granular emissions data and no consistent methodology,â said John Revess, director Net Zero Transformation at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). âTo remain a part of global supply chains, it will be necessary for companies to accurately calculate the carbon footprint of their products based on measured values,â predicted Revess. As a member of WBCSD, SAP and other companies are defining a <a href="https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy/Climate/SOS-1.5/Resources/Value-Chain-Carbon-Transparency-Pathfinder-Enabling-decarbonization-through-Scope-3-emissions-transparency">Value Chain Carbon Transparency Pathfinder</a> for the exchange of carbon emissions data.</p>
  <p>âTo meet our decarbonization goals, we depend on credible data from our suppliers on the carbon footprints of the components we build our vehicles with,â said Ralf Pfitzner, global head of Sustainability at Volkswagen, at the <a href="https://events.sap.com/sap-sustainability-summit/en/home">SAP Sustainability Summit</a>.</p>
  <p>The two-day online meeting focused on how companies are applying new technologies to reduce their environmental footprint and manage limited resources. âWe decided to join SAP in the co-innovation of a digital carbon tracking tool and database, and this is really exciting because there is obviously a demand,â said Pfitzner.</p>
  <p>Volkswagen and SAP are working together toward decarbonization in other ways. In 2020, their CEOs Herbert Diess and Christian Klein joined the <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2021/03/European-CEO-Alliance-advocates-for-ambitious-climate-strategy.html#:~:text=The%20CEO%20Alliance%20considers%20itself,chain%20and%20rapid%20build%2Dup">CEO Alliance for Europeâs Recovery, Reform, and Resilience</a>. The Allianceâs 10 European business leaders have committed 100 billion to decarbonizing their companies and products and are calling for far-reaching climate protection measures.</p>
  <h2 id="massive-investments-necessary-in-electrification-and-digitalization">Massive Investments Necessary in Electrification and Digitalization</h2>
  <p>VW is <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-group-raises-investments-in-future-technologies-to-eur-73-billion-6607">investing a hefty â¬73 billion</a> to help put its decarbonization challenges in the rear-view mirror. The underlying reasons for <a href="/2021/04/sustainability-study-from-sap-actions-challenges">companiesâ investments in environmental issues</a> varies, spanning industry regulations (29%) to societyâs approval of their organization (27%) and strengthening company reputation (26%). Uncertainty as to how to embed sustainability into business processes and IT systems is seen as the greatest barrier to implementing plans for action, <a href="/2021/04/sustainability-study-from-sap-actions-challenges">one study concludes</a>.</p>
  <p>Despite the challenges, VWâs Pfitzner is optimistic about achieving the companyâs decarbonization targets. VWâs head of sustainability expects digitalization to play a major role in this transformation. âBeyond green electricity, there are plenty of opportunities where digitalization will help us reduce our carbon footprint, for example by hooking the manufacturing data into the cloud and having more efficient programming of robots,â he said.</p>
  <p>Pfitzner reiterated <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/stories/2019/12/what-volkswagen-is-doing-for-the-environment.html">VWâs 2050 goal of carbon neutrality</a> along the entire lifecycle of its cars, emphasizing the need for intermediate milestones. âThe coming decades will be essential for the transformation of transport and the car industry. By 2030, we intend to reduce the lifecycle carbon footprint of our passenger car portfolio by 30% compared to 2018,â said Pfitzner.</p>

  <p>Although nearly two-thirds of the global economy is covered by net zero targets, achieving them will require systems thinking and collaborative action among businesses of a type and scale that has never been done before, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/deloitte-announces-senior-partner-appointments-in-climate-change-and-transport.html">said Hannah Routh</a>, partner, Deloitte UK. âThe proof will be in the implementation,â she predicted.</p>
  <p>âNo business or country can become net zero in isolation,â said Routh. âWhether you are looking at energy supply, transportation, infrastructure, government, or communities, they all need to act in a coordinated way.â</p>
  <p>One of the biggest challenges for companies, says Routh, is embedding climate transformation into their business strategies and decision-making processes. This requires data transparency, she emphasizes, noting that there is no shortage of data, but the quality and usability of the data must be ensured.</p>
  <p>Nicolas Peter, BMWâs chief financial officer, agrees. âDigitalization helps in a significant way to increase data quality, and, from an auditorâs perspective, data quality is key in order to perform his responsibility in the audit process,â he said at SAPâs Sustainability Summit. Peter left no doubts that BMW is counting on new technologies to help it <a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/blog/bmw-joins-growing-list-of-automakers-committed-to-bold-climate-action/">achieve its climate targets</a>: âThe trend to sustainability has to be accompanied by digitalization. There is no alternative,â said Peter.</p>
  <h2 id="digitalization-supports-decarbonization">Digitalization Supports Decarbonization</h2>
  <p>âCEOs need transparency into their supply chains,â said Thomas Saueressig, head of Product Engineering and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. âThrough its strategic initiative <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/sustainability/climate21">Climate 21</a>, SAP is launching new solutions that help customers reduce their emissions and manage their carbon footprint.â</p>
  <p>A new integrated set of solutions announced at the SAP Sustainability Summit includes SAP Product Footprint Management, which treats greenhouse gases like a âcurrencyâ in the value chain. âOur sustainability management solutions enable companies not only to optimize their production facilities according to top line and bottom line, but also according to greenhouse gas emissions,â said Saueressig. As part of several joint sustainability initiatives with Accenture, <a href="/2021/04/sap-and-accenture-sustainability-better-business">SAP and Accenture are working</a> to develop new SAP solutions that address sustainability and enhance existing core technologies.</p>
  <h2 id="the-need-for-speed">The Need for Speed</h2>
  <p>Setting data quality issues aside, the most important factor for transforming businesses to net-zero is speed, said Deloitteâs Routh. âI think the world can master this, but my concern is whether it can do it quickly enough. The businesses that are going to succeed are the ones that understand and embrace the urgency.â</p>

      <div><em>Where thereâs a will, thereâs a way</em>. This proverb dating back to the 1600s could not be more appropriate today as enterprises around the world grapple with the biggest business challenge of our lifetimes: creating a sustainable future.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Unsurprisingly, many companies are daunted by the seemingly insurmountable challenges, so SAP and Accenture are taking action to help them.</p>

  <h2 id="the-right-time">The Right Time</h2>
  <p>By now, we all know we must radically change the way businesses run, our impact on the environment, and the inequalities in society. Thatâs the only way to ensure a lifestyle that allows us to meet our current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.</p>
  <p>The signs are everywhere. Consumers are increasingly aware about the negative environmental impact of products and services, such as fast fashion, single-use plastics, food waste, and excessive packaging. They are demanding accountability and responsible business models from their favorite brands. Governments are increasing regulations around carbon emissions and waste management and are demanding manufacturers to take responsibility for their impact on the environment.</p>
  <p>Enterprises are under pressure from investors to include their environmental, societal, and governance (ESG) factors in their financial performance reports. And finally, employees are increasingly vocal about the environmental policies and actions of their employers. Businesses know they need to act, but few are rising to the challenge.</p>
  <p>A study by Accenture found while the United Nations (UN) Global Compactâs Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) program has challenged companies to enhance their commitment to the UN SDGs, only 25% have set goals aligned to societal or environmental needs. Although CEOs acknowledge the universal call-to-action to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, less than 50% have implemented sustainability into their operations.</p>
  <h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
  <p>As a survey of business drivers and actions to improve the environment at planetary scale conducted by SAP Insights revealed there are numerous barriers. Almost 7,500 CEOs and other business leaders from 16 industries around the globe participated in the survey. The top three reasons they cited for not moving ahead were lack of clarity on how to embed sustainability in business processes and IT systems, lack of clarity on how potential actions would align with strategy, and difficulty proving return on investment. Other factors include lack of funding, lack of expertise, or lack of support from senior management.</p>
  <p>The challenges are daunting, which is why solving sustainability issues is not something individual corporations or governments can do alone. The way ahead involves <a href="https://insights.sap.com/government-business-civil-society-fast-track-circularity/">cooperation and collaboration</a>. In this decade of delivery, partnerships are crucial.</p>

  <p>Accenture and SAP, for example, <a href="/2021/04/accenture-sap-partnership-accelerate-sustainability">have just announced they are expanding their long-term engagement</a> to help companies embed sustainability across the full spectrum of their business operations. This will help unlock new value and realize long-term growth.</p>
  <p>By combining SAP technology with Accentureâs <a href="http://www.accenture.com/sustainabilityservices">Sustainability Services</a>, the partners plan to jointly create new solutions that can empower companies to accelerate their progress on decarbonizing their supply chains and capture their share of the projected $4.5 trillion economic growth that the <a href="https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781349959679">circular economy could bring</a>.</p>
  <p>Together, Accenture and SAP will develop the new SAP Responsible Production and Design solution, which will help companies consume fewer resources and build sustainability within the design process. It will also enable companies to apply analytics to the operational, asset, and process data collected across the value chain. Such an integrated view will help them determine clear sustainability goals and metrics across business processes.</p>
  <p>As a result, companies will be able to reduce the costs of compliance and extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulation by designing and producing products with <a href="https://insights.sap.com/circularity-creates-value-from-waste/">more recycled content and less waste</a>.</p>
  <p>Accenture also supports SAPâs <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/climate21">Climate 21</a> initiative, which allows companies in any industry to use analytics to measure and minimize carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions and lower the carbon footprint across the product life cycle. Adding sustainability metrics across the supply chain provides an integrated view of environmental savings and helps optimize operations.</p>
  <p>This type of co-innovation could help solve some of the barriers cited in the SAP Insights survey. Embedding sustainability in business processes and IT systems and measuring return on investment (ROI) gives enterprises a better understanding of how to fund their sustainability efforts. With time and success companies can gain expertise, set aside funds, and engage senior leadership to support their sustainability journey.</p>
  <h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
  <p>The Accenture study identifies three things leaders anywhere in any industry can do to start implementing and scaling plans of action to address climate change, social inequalities, and resource availability.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Raise ambition and impact:</strong> Leaders must drive change in their own organizations, and through the disruption of market systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Change collaboration:</strong> Key players must connect in new ways because meaningful transformation is not a solo sport.</li>
    <li><strong>Redefine responsible leadership:</strong> Leaders must embrace their role as change agents to champion the sustainability agenda.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To learn more about the SAP and Accenture partnership for a sustainable future, join the virtual <a href="https://events.sap.com/sap-sustainability-summit/en/home">SAP Sustainability Summit</a>, taking place April 28-29. The event will focus on how companies are reducing their environmental footprints and managing limited resources productively while steering and reporting their businesses holistically.</p>

  <p>Sydney Water, a water supplier, is aware of this responsibility that covers an area of more than 12.000 km2. In order to continue providing world class service to its customers, Sydney Water has updated its billing processes to optimize its workflows and help provide its customers bills that are easy to understand. Together with SAP, the water supplier decided to act and replaced the outdated system with a modern and flexible billing platform.</p>
