  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The world has grappled with access to quality education for decades — a situation further complicated by the momentum of advancing technologies and, as a result, the ever-changing skills needed to succeed in the world.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And just when we think we have figured out a <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4">framework</a>, a path forward to “solve the solvable” issues like education through the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), a global pandemic wipes out educational gains made over the last 20 years.</p>
  <div class="promo">
    <div>
      <div>The Global Business Coalition for Education confirms that before COVID-19,<br>260 million children were out of primary and secondary school — and<br>75 million had their education interrupted by conflicts and emergencies. Because of<br>the pandemic, 1.6 billion children were forced out of the classroom.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Today we are confronted with both the harsh reality of life and an opportunity for a better tomorrow. <a href="/topics/covid-19">COVID-19</a> has willed the world to prioritize and focus efforts on what matters most.</p>
  <p>On January 24, SAP joins organizations across the world in recognition of <a href="https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/educationday">International Day of Education</a>. We reflect upon the important role education plays for a sustainable future and <a href="http://www.sap.com/csr">SAP Corporate Social Responsibility’s</a> efforts to power equitable access to education and workforce readiness initiatives.</p>
  <p>After a decade of bringing our best to the world to accelerate social business, join us in celebrating the impact achieved in this area through the award-winning <a href="http://www.sap.com/socialsabbatical">SAP Social Sabbatical</a> initiative.</p>

  <p>For the past 50 years, SAP has guided organizations to become intelligent, sustainable enterprises. SAP Social Sabbatical has embraced this approach. By connecting employees and their skills to social sector organizations through pro bono consulting, we expedite world-changing solutions.</p>
  <p>The portfolio of programs, executed in partnership with <a href="https://www.pyxeraglobal.org/">PYXERA Global</a><u>,</u> offers unique triple impact and delivers long-term sustainable benefits to client organizations, SAP participants, and the company. Our celebration honors this community, which includes 1,371 SAP employees who have worked alongside 453 nonprofit and social enterprise clients spanning 52 countries. Collectively, we have positively impacted more than 6 million people worldwide since 2012.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youth4jobs.org/">Youth4Jobs</a> is a nonprofit organization based in Hyderabad, India. The organization creates education and employment opportunities for youth with disabilities that in turn delivers sustainable change for their families. In February 2019, Youth4Jobs hosted SAP Social Sabbatical participants, and challenged them to improve the organization’s business development strategy.</p>
  <p>Founder and CEO Meera Shenoy shared, “The three SAP consultants adopted our passion for inclusion quickly and became part of the larger Youth4Jobs family, understanding our challenges and our transformational work. They also gave us a peek into the amazing processes of SAP in every area, be it recruitment, marketing, or customer cycle.” Shenoy believes that beyond the direct outcome of the project, her team was able to embrace these critical skills which continue to serve the organization and accelerate their incredible work.</p>
  <p>Recently, SAP CSR partnered with <a href="https://60decibels.com/">60 Decibels</a>, an end-to-end impact measurement company, to conduct a study on the SAP Social Sabbatical. Eight-six percent of clients affirmed that participation in the program had a positive long-term impact on the beneficiaries they serve. One program director in Romania shared, “The work that we did together allowed us to build a scaled system to train teachers we serve for free and better prepare them for online teaching during the pandemic and afterwards. Significantly more teachers are now enrolled with our courses and activities than before.”</p>

  <p>The last decade has demonstrated that pro bono consulting delivers truly transformative and lasting change. Throughout 2022, we are thrilled to bring you additional learnings from our decade of impact study with 60 Decibels to showcase the benefits realized by social sector clients, employees who participate, and SAP overall.</p>
  <p>The strategy for SAP Social Sabbatical, initiated in 2012 as part of SAP’s response to the education crisis, is now evolving to also address the company’s pursuits around zero emissions and zero waste, while continuing to focus on zero inequality. We look forward to sharing more inspiration, innovation, and real solutions from our journey — past, present, and, most importantly, our future.</p>

      <div>The math curriculum taught to today’s high school students is out of sync with the current landscape and our everyday use of technology. A <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/math-curriculum/">podcast by <em>Freakonomics</em> author Steven Levitt</a> discusses the current “geometry sandwich” of Algebra I/Geometry/Algebra II, which was designed to prepare students for the Space Race of the 1950s, not where we are today.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Data Science for Everyone found that 90% of the world’s data was created in the last two years. However, only 11% of high school students take a statistics course. Data science jobs have seen a 650% growth since 2012 and reports show that seven of 10 careers with the fastest growth are data-centric. In order to prepare students for the future, a change needs to be made with their relationship with data.</p>
  <p>Data Science for Everyone is a <a href="https://www.datascience4everyone.org/about">national movement for advancing data literacy in the U.S.</a> among students, comprised of a coalition of more than 160 educators, policymakers, and industry leaders. Earlier this year, Data Science for Everyone submitted a letter to the Biden administration urging to make data literacy a national priority. They have created actionable steps and gathered resources for educators to implement into their curriculum.</p>
  <p>To date, states including California, Oregon, and Ohio are working to update their current curriculum to meet the growing demand. Additionally, UCLA’s Introduction to Data Science course is taught in 26 school districts nationwide. This is still not enough; additional advocacy is needed to help ensure that the issue of data literacy remains part of the conversation surrounding education.</p>
  <p>Last month, Data Science for Everyone held a virtual Commitments Campaign event to bring together all stakeholders who are working to make a change in data literacy. The event garnered 272 commitments from companies, education leaders, and policymakers that impact more than 3 million students, 25,000 teachers, and 500 school districts.</p>
  <p>Dr. Karina Edmonds, senior vice president and head of Academies and <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/next-gen-innovation-platform/university-alliances.html">SAP University Alliances</a> for SAP, spoke to how data science education strengthens our communities and workforce: “We absolutely have to get everyone at the table as the growth of data science jobs continues to skyrocket. We can’t afford to leave a great part of our society behind.”</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.datascience4everyone.org/commitments-event-2021?wix-vod-video-id=5f4d3c8871784f06a4d86981aab2c1ac&#x26;wix-vod-comp-id=comp-kqjzhw47">49ers and SAP have committed to offer rich educational data science resources</a> for K-12 students over the next year. SAP and the 49ers Foundation plan to launch a new data science course by next year that will include data modules focused on using football data to make data science more relevant to students. The two phased program will be comprised of virtual lessons for middle school students, along with a high school curriculum and field trips for grades 9-12.</p>
  <p>We can each play a role with bringing this movement to life. Individuals can make their own personal commitment to help ensure that students have access to data literacy skills. Simple things like the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parents and adults must encourage children’s curiosity around data science and math. Projecting negative past experiences with math and science can influence children’s relationship with data science in the future. Remove negative self-talk — things like “I hate math” or “I’m not good with numbers” — that are only hurting the curiosity we want youth to have.</li>
    <li>Contact decision-makers and initiate conversations in your community to find support for modern standards that reflect the data-centric world. This can include contacting the Department of Education, state legislators, or the local school board and district superintendent. These policymakers influence curriculum, course offerings, and teachers’ professional development, so engaging these leaders and getting them excited about data science can unlock the potential of new courses and better trained teachers.</li>
    <li>Get personally involved as a volunteer. Not all programs rely on volunteer support, but there is great importance in students hearing from experts in the topic being discussed. The SAP Corporate Social Responsibility team has partners across North America that can host employees for speaking opportunities. Check out organizations like <a href="https://www.csforallteachers.org/">Computer Science for All Teachers</a> and <a href="https://www.techgirlz.org/volunteer/">Tech Girlz</a>.</li>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>At this year’s Globe Series conference, SAP Labs Canada Chief Operating Officer Agnes Garaba represented SAP’s market-leading stance in social procurement. During her session, <a href="https://capital.globeseries.com/agenda/session/499305">Leverage Your Purchasing Power: Procurement to Build Back Better</a>, she helped the audience explore both why and how social procurement creates holistic economic, social, and environmental impact.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Every purchase has an economic, environmental, and/or social impact — whether intended or not. <a href="/2020/10/social-procurement-better-way-grow">Social procurement</a> is the practice of bringing together buyers with suppliers that not only have a quality good or service, but one that delivers on the promise of social and/or environmental impact. Often, these intentional positive contributions are reinvested into the local economy and add to the economic equity and vibrancy of the community. Social enterprises are business that practice social procurement as part of their mission to culturally and operationally change the world. They are founded and governed based on a clear social or environmental mission and they reinvest most of their profit back into this mission.</p>
  <p>SAP understands the importance of prioritizing social procurement. As Garaba noted: “Seventy-seven percent of the world’s transactions run through an SAP system. It puts us in a unique place to have the opportunity, and also the responsibility, to drive positive changes. SAP’s social purchasing strategy began more than a decade ago with the inclusion of social enterprises in our Canadian supply chain. Today, our global ecosystem of partners focused on scaling social procurement, in addition to those inspiring new ideas and accelerating social ventures, collectively impact more than 1 billion beneficiaries across the globe.”</p>
  <p>The commitment of SAP’s social procurement implementation is a two-pronged approach. The first relies on an initial top-down mandate, with executives and the Board supporting it, including putting resources behind it. The other aspect is, as Garaba explains, “a bit of a grassroots approach. We have established a ‘Procurement with Purpose’ ambassador network; these are people both within the procurement organization and others who are also making strategic buying decisions. They are the multipliers and they are the ones who help the organization identify opportunities for positive change.”</p>
  <p>Sustainable procurement has been a central part of the public sector agenda for some time, which is game changing since Canadian governments alone spend $200 billion on procurement. It is also gaining traction in the private sector, as businesses recognize that integrating social value into purchasing and supply chain decisions makes them more competitive and sustainable. SAP has a demonstrated commitment to scaling the sector through social procurement. Notably, SAP <a href="/2020/10/sap-launches-55by25-purposeful-procurement">launched a 5 &#x26; 5 by ‘25 initiative</a>, aiming to spend five percent of addressable spend with diverse enterprises, which are defined as businesses that are at least 51% owned and operated by an individual or group that is traditionally underrepresented, and social enterprises by 2025, and encouraging organizations across industries to join the pledge.</p>

  <h2 id="sap-and-buy-social-canada">SAP and Buy Social Canada</h2>
  <p>SAP co-innovates and co-develops programs with corporate social responsibility (CSR) partners, accelerating change and driving sustainable impact. Beyond internal commitments and Procurement with Purpose ambassadors, SAP fosters social procurement in partnership with social enterprise and social procurement intermediary <a href="https://www.buysocialcanada.com">Buy Social Canada</a>, supporting the development of social procurement across the country by working to connect buyers to certified social enterprise business sellers, unleashing the biggest untapped potential to create sustainable impact in our communities and for the planet.</p>
  <p>Buy Social Canada and SAP are working together to advance the social enterprise sector in Canada by collaborating on initiatives, like the <a href="https://www.buysocialcanada.com/services/social-purchasing-partnerships/">Buy Social Pledge</a>, that deliver better access to markets and buyers, as well as creating opportunities for employees to engage in growing the capacity of local social enterprises. One of the barriers preventing large-scale social enterprise investment is that social enterprises are often small businesses, thus lacking the capacity to be providers for large, multi-national companies like SAP. SAP has implemented a pro bono volunteering program to help build capacity for social enterprises, understanding that they need to grow to become true procurement partners.</p>
  <p>“If you don’t start small, there is no way to build capacity. Small steps but consistent steps will lead much further than trying to do really big leaps,” Garaba notes.</p>
  <p>Working with MovingWorlds, SAP launched the <a href="https://movingworlds.org/social-enterprise-revenue-accelerator">Sustainable Growth of Revenues for International Development</a> (S-GRID) program. The program recently acknowledged as an <a href="https://blog.movingworlds.org/world-changing-idea/">honorable mention for Fast Company’s 2021 World Changing Ideas</a>, helps social enterprises build revenue partnerships with the corporate sector to become more integrated into global value chains.</p>

  <p>Within the SAP existing procurement spend and purchasing power, the potential for change is massive. With increasing focus on consumerism, it is important to buy and sell responsibly. Where can doing good coincide with doing good business? With time, the hope is that by buying goods and services from organizations with a purpose-driven mission the cycle of good is perpetuated.</p>
  <p>Although there is a growing interest from corporations like SAP to “buy social,” the current supply is not strong enough to meet the global demand. As a result, we work with organizations like Buy Social Canada and invest in programs such as MovingWorld’s S-GRID to help ensure that more enterprises around the world are procurement-ready and can sustainably grow their revenue streams.</p>
  <p>This is not an overnight process. SAP has spent more than a decade accelerating and scaling the work of social entrepreneurs and it is only the beginning. SAP will continue to diligently invest in this for the foreseeable future; in 2021 specifically through partnerships and collaborative work with a continued focus on capacity-building ventures within the sector and expanding access to markets and buyers.</p>
