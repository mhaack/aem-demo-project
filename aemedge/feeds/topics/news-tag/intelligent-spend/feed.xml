  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>As a pioneer of spend management software, SAP has been on the cutting edge of how to best comprehensively manage company spend and supplier relationships.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Like at home, identifying every dollar you spend and getting the most out of it is more critical than ever for your business. And as we continue to roll out SAP Business AI technology, the teams behind SAP solutions are working on ways to help you reduce the time spent on mundane tasks so you can focus on executing your strategy, unlocking spend potential, and unleashing efficiency.</p>
  <p>The first quarter of 2024 was among the most productive in my 18 years at SAP. We debuted new AI capabilities in various SAP spend management solutions. Check out some of these highlights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SAP Ariba Category Management</strong>: We’ve incorporated <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/spend-management-blogs-by-sap/generative-ai-powered-content-recommendations-in-sap-ariba-category/ba-p/13640447?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">generative AI-enabled features</a> that can assist category managers by generating recommendations in the solution’s category segmentation, market dynamics, and cost structure tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Scoutbee Discovery</strong>: SAP partnered with Scoutbee, a leading AI-powered supplier intelligence and discovery platform, to launch <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-2001012892_live_v1/scoutbee-discovery?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">Scoutbee Discovery</a>. This SAP endorsed app can rapidly identify qualified suppliers that meet specific criteria and can help advance strategic business imperatives. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/7176993552332140544/comments/">Watch the recording</a> of me participating in a recent LinkedIn Live with the Scoutbee team.</li>
    <li><strong>Concur Request:</strong> Now, this service uses generative AI to help provide <a href="https://www.concur.com/blog/article/sap-concur-delivers-enriched-travel-and-expense-experiences-at-fusion-2024?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">intelligent cost estimates</a> for trip planning.</li>
    <li><strong>ExpenseIt</strong>: Users can upload receipt images to the ExpenseIt solution, which taps AI to help <a href="https://www.concur.com/blog/article/sap-concur-delivers-enriched-travel-and-expense-experiences-at-fusion-2024?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">automatically create a new expense</a> with several key fields prepopulated. Plus, ExpenseIt can now itemize hotel folios using generative AI.</li>
    <li><strong>Generative AI search</strong>: A new capability within Concur Support allows SAP Concur customers to type questions in natural language and get quick answers using generative AI, <a href="https://www.concur.com/blog/article/sap-concur-delivers-enriched-travel-and-expense-experiences-at-fusion-2024?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">without submitting a support ticket</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SAP’s market-leading spend and business network solutions are getting even smarter, working to unlock greater value for our customers. We have many resources devoted to spend management and that’s why we continue to deliver innovation in spend management.</p>
  <p>And we are only getting started. By the end of 2024, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">SAP Business Network</a> is planning the following enhancements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Generative AI RFI/RFP responses in SAP Business Network Discovery</strong>: With generative AI-enabled responses for postings in SAP Business Network Discovery, suppliers will be able to respond to RFIs promptly and more accurately, helping to save time and reduce costs associated with manual labor and resource allocation.</li>
    <li><strong>Catalog enrichment using ChatGPT recommendations</strong>: This feature can enable suppliers to generate and improve product descriptions and overall catalog quality based on prompts and keyword recommendations from ChatGPT.</li>
    <li><strong>Intelligent error simplification using generative AI</strong>: This feature uses machine learning and a large language model to interpret and categorize invoice rejection reasons, allowing suppliers to reduce the number of failing invoices, improve rapid invoice submission and payment, and optimize cash flow.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>
  <p>What’s more, G2 recently announced its <a href="https://www.g2.com/best-software-companies">2024 Best Software Award winners</a>, with SAP Fieldglass and SAP Concur receiving high honors:</p>

A big congratulations also goes out to Darcy MacClaren, CRO for SAP Digital Supply Chain, who received a Pros to Know Lifetime Achievement award.</p>
  <h2 id="driving-success-for-our-customers">Driving Success for Our Customers</h2>
  <p>Hearing me spotlight our direct and indirect procurement, external workforce, and travel and expense management solutions is one thing. Seeing them in action is something way more powerful. Here are a few recent customer success stories to take in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>American Eagle Outfitters</strong> (AEO), a leading global specialty retailer offering high-quality on-trend clothing, accessories, and personal care products through its portfolio of brands, needed to evaluate indirect purchasing processes and vendor relationships to maximize efficiency. See how <a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/10/2ed3b1af-917e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.htm?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124l">SAP Business Network for Procurement and SAP Ariba solutions</a> helped simplify processes and deliver compliant purchasing protocols across the company.</li>
    <li>Power provider to over 900,000 electric customers, <strong>Oklahoma Gas &#x26; Electric Company</strong> (OG&#x26;E) faced challenges with the complexity of third-party and cross-department management of contingent workers. After transitioning SAP Fieldglass solutions to internal management, OG&#x26;E <a href="/2024/02/oge-and-brightspeed-manage-employees-contingent-workers">gained the visibility</a> to make more informed financial decisions, like supplier negotiations.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/entries/2024-award.html#winners?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">2024 SAP Innovation Award winner</a> <strong>Vestas Wind Systems</strong>, the world’s largest manufacturer of wind turbines, launched a large-scale quality initiative powered by SAP Business Network to help mitigate product defects in a highly complex supply chain. Now, using SAP Business Network, suppliers complete predefined quality tests and document them before confirming or sending an order. This enables Vestas employees to be warned in advance of any quality issues further up the supply chain, so they can <a href="/2024/02/vestas-powering-quality-in-supply-chain">take corrective action</a>.</li>
    <li>Most <strong>KUKA</strong> employees are based in Germany, where tax regulation is complex and submitting hotel and entertainment expenses is anything but simple. The KUKA team worked together to develop a simple process using SAP Concur solutions, connected to SAP ERP, that allows employees to create hotel and entertainment expenses <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/casestudy/kuka?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">seven times faster</a> with fewer errors and fewer rejected expense reports.</li>
  </ul>

      <div>When Danielle Thomé was a teenager, she asked her father for a job. That’s not unusual, especially since her father was the founder of Projex Engenharia, a successful business in Brazil. But the business focused on civil and industrial construction, an industry where a 15-year-old girl didn’t fit the typical job description, despite her passion for civil engineering. Although Thomé would eventually take over her father’s business, her road to success was paved with many challenges.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“One of the biggest challenges I faced was the age-old problem of gender discrimination,” Thomé recalled years later. She is one of many women driven to lead businesses that reflect their life passions.</p>
  <p>Like other entrepreneurial women, she needed support. But where are the networks to help women turn their passions into successful businesses? Thomé found her network in an SAP customer. <a href="https://weconnectinternational.org/">WEConnect International</a> connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers around the world. As a result of becoming WEConnect International certified – and a lot of hard work by Thomé and her team – Projex Engenharia’s revenue grew by a staggering 200% in just two years.</p>
  <h2 id="many-challenges-huge-potential-impact">Many Challenges, Huge Potential Impact</h2>
  <p>Women who start and lead businesses face unique challenges. Cultural and social norms, or simply being underestimated by investors, can impede their entrepreneurial efforts. <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/02/for-female-founders-only-fundraising-from-female-vcs-comes-at-a-cost">Harvard Business Review</a> observes that “women are massively under-represented among both venture-backed entrepreneurs and VC investors.” It adds that companies founded solely by women receive <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">less than 3%</a> of all venture capital investments.</p>
  <p>Also, the pandemic exacerbated the imbalance in unpaid care work – managing the household or caring for children and aging parents – which disproportionally affects women in business.</p>
  <p>Women must also deal with the challenges other businesses face, including access to markets, information technology gaps, and the red tape involved with government programs designed to help new businesses.</p>
  <p>Yet despite these challenges, women-owned and women-led businesses offer the potential to make a significant impact on the global economy. The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/this-is-why-women-must-play-a-greater-role-in-the-global-economy/">World Economic Forum (WEF)</a> observed that “societies with greater gender equality not only offer better socioeconomic opportunities for women, but also tend to grow faster and more equitably.”</p>
  <p>The WEF also reports that advancing women’s employment <a href="https://initiatives.weforum.org/accelerators-network/gender-parity">could add US$12 trillion to global GDP and boost some countries’ economic output by as much as 35%</a>.</p>
  <p>Yet despite a clear business case, the WEF sees global progress stagnating.</p>

  <p>Traditionally, the <a href="/topics/procurement">procurement</a> function within larger organizations has held the power to fill supply chain gaps and build networks of suppliers. Yet today, other voices are making themselves heard. Consumers are expressing preferences to buy from women and other diverse businesses. Around the world – for example in the United States, Australia, and Canada – government regulations are requiring increased diversity and inclusion.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the C-suite is reframing corporate policy to reflect more sophisticated approaches to selecting suppliers. In my role as customer officer, SAP Intelligent Spend &#x26; Business Network, I see business leaders prioritizing inclusive sourcing metrics within their procurement strategies to help ensure they have access to all the world’s best suppliers, not just the ones they always buy from.</p>
  <p>Concerned about supply chain risks, procurement leaders are increasingly adopting localization strategies. While seeking new local suppliers, they also focus on inclusive sourcing. Of course, finding diverse suppliers is not easy – even local ones. Many women-owned businesses are small entities, not well-known in the business community. They often lack access to communication technology that would help them create greater visibility for the business.</p>
  <p>How can we make it easier to connect enterprise buyers and women-owned businesses?</p>
  <h2 id="creating-connections-with-sap-technology">Creating Connections with SAP Technology</h2>
  <p>As president, CEO, and co-founder of <a href="https://weconnectinternational.org/">WEConnect International</a>, Elizabeth Vazquez is a leader in women’s economic empowerment and global supplier diversity and inclusion. Through WEConnect International, she helps women around the world grow their businesses to create wealth, hire more people, and contribute to the prosperity of their communities.</p>
  <p>Last week, she participated in panel discussions during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The discussions focused on opportunities to direct more corporate spend to women-owned businesses, not only to do good but to close supply chain gaps.</p>
  <p>“Women-owned businesses are a valuable and under-utilized resource,” she said. “The women who run these businesses understand what their communities need most, and they are in a unique position to help solve them. In the process, they are creating entirely new industries.”</p>
  <p>WEConnect International recognizes that to compete in the global marketplace, women-owned businesses must be visible to potential customers. It developed the WECommunity platform, a global register of women-owned businesses that makes it easier for buyers to find women-owned suppliers.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the initial version of WECommunity relied on technology that delivered a poor user experience, making searching the register cumbersome. WEConnect International needed a scalable, global solution that offered smooth user experiences in multiple languages for buyers and suppliers.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/supplier-lifecycle.html">SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance</a> solution and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html">SAP Business Network</a> more than met these criteria. As an added advantage, many of the WECommunity member buyers were already transacting on SAP Business Network. SAP partner Premikati Inc., a women-owned business, was engaged to help deploy the SAP solutions.</p>
  <p>In its first year, the improved functionality of WECommunity produced dramatic outcomes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Buyer membership increased by 91%, a $2 trillion increase in purchasing power.</li>
    <li>Over 6,000 women-owned businesses experienced revenue growth, creating 24,000 new jobs.</li>
    <li>Over 7,800 new registered women-owned businesses joined the database, a 95% growth.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>“By making it easier for women to register their businesses and for large buyers to find them, our online portal based on the SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance solution, SAP Business Network, and SAP Business Technology Platform helps women compete in a global marketplace,” Vazquez explained.</p>
  <h2 id="breaking-through-the-barriers">Breaking Through the Barriers</h2>
  <p>Remember Thomé, the teenage girl who wanted to work in her father’s construction business? Today, she is owner-director of Projex Engenharia, the business her father founded.</p>
  <p><a href="https://weconnectinternational.org/success-stories/danielle-thome/">As a noted in a recent profile</a>, Projex Engenharia earned the WEConnect International Women’s Business Enterprise Certification. Thomé leveraged the global network of women suppliers and large buyers to become a more confident and assertive leader.</p>
  <p>The relationship has also helped produce significant benefits for her business. In just six years, Projex Engenharia landed six large corporations as clients. This enabled the company to hire more people, ensure their safety and well-being, and support social, health, and environmental campaigns.</p>
  <p>SAP is committed to helping all customers achieve their diversity and equity goals. And it is gratifying to know that our technology has become a valuable tool in making this happen.</p>

      <div>As eventful as 2020 was, 2021 has certainly been full of surprises too. This time last year we were anxiously awaiting the vaccine rollout and the return to life as we knew it before COVID-19.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Fast-forward to today and we are still witnessing the ongoing effect of the pandemic wreaking havoc worldwide with widespread supply chain disruption, the “Great Resignation,” and variants continuing to cause uncertainty.</p>
  <p>In 2020 we saw panic buying leading to toilet paper shortages; this year we’re grappling with the impact of the microchip shortage in the automotive and high tech industries. And for those of us who didn’t start holiday shopping before Halloween, we may not see our gifts arrive until the new year. On top of this, every industry from restaurants and retail to manufacturing and logistics are struggling to fill vacant jobs to meet growing business demand as COVID-19 restrictions continue to evolve.</p>
  <p>On the bright side, companies are continuing to rebound and are looking for solutions to manage their ongoing sourcing, supply chain and labor challenges. We asked our global leaders for their perspective on what to watch for in 2022. Here’s what they had to say.</p>
  <div class="footnote">
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>“The impact of the pandemic-driven lockdowns underscores how the global economy is a networked economy. Companies know that no business does business alone — success depends not only on one company’s ability to deliver, but the abilities of all companies in its entire supply chain. To adapt to ever-changing business challenges, procurement and supply chain leaders will increasingly look to cloud-based and network-aware solutions to deliver the innovation they need to continually align their spend strategy to their business strategy.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>–</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-wookey-786360b/">John Wookey</a>, president, Intelligent Spend and Business Network, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“Clogged cargo ports, backlogged rail yards, microchip and gas shortages: 18 months later and we are still feeling the economic aftershocks of the disruption brought on by COVID-19. We had hoped that business would get back to ‘normal’ in 2021. As we enter a new year, we realize that ‘disruption is the new normal’ and resilience is a top priority. In 2022, companies need to formalize resilience, building sustainable supply chain execution that supports business growth. Despite the volatility, organizations must take a step back and look at spend holistically. An integrated spend management approach spanning procurement, external workforce and travel and expense management, will provide customers with the visibility and agility they need to adapt to changes in their markets while continuing to drive their business objectives.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>–</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/etoshathurman/">Etosha Thurman</a>, chief marketing and solutions officer,</em><br><em>Intelligent Spend and Business Network, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“It has been nearly two years since the pandemic began wreaking havoc on the world’s businesses, exposing the fragility of linear supply chains and the need for a more networked economy. During this time, many businesses have changed their view of procurement from cost watchdog to that of a strategic enabler. As we enter 2022, many procurement leaders are tasked with aligning every spend decision to their overall corporate strategies. To best deliver on this responsibility, these professionals will need an integrated view of total spend across the enterprise and deep into their supply chain. This level of visibility will enable the necessary information sharing and collaboration needed to contribute to stronger business benefits, including better inventory management, more predictable lead times, alternative sources of supply, stronger supplier compliance, and, of course, continued cost savings.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>–</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffcollier/">Jeff Collier</a>, chief revenue officer, Intelligent Spend and Business Network, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“As global markets continue to face unprecedented labor shortages across industries, businesses will see an increased need to master external workforce management and maximize talent utilization. Tapping into contingent workers and service providers will continue to gain momentum beyond the pandemic as businesses are realizing the benefits: improved productivity, agility and resilience, reduced costs, increased access to quality talent, and flexibility. With an estimated 70% of executives anticipating they will hire more temporary workers and freelancers over the next two years, external workforce will remain a top priority across organizations. With this comes the need for leaders to have complete visibility into their usage of external workforce to make more calculated, timely decisions about who is doing the work, at what cost, where, and for how long. Digitalizing and automating external workforce management processes and improving visibility will help companies reduce inefficiencies and gain the most value out of its flexible resources.”</p>

        <p>“This has been the year of supply chain disruption. People who have never heard the term supply chain before are now talking about it as everyone is experiencing stock shortages in stores and lack of availability of the holiday gifts we had planned to buy. Recent events like COVID-19 and Brexit have shown that traditional, linear, fragmented supply chains no longer work, and no business can do business alone. Companies will look to move beyond enterprise-centric systems toward those that are designed for cross-company transparency and collaboration. A digital network approach can transform fragmented supply chains into unified, collaborative, intelligent networks for supply, logistics, asset management, and service. With tighter collaboration between trading partners on a trusted network, companies can better anticipate shifts in supply and demand, deepening their competitive edge in the face of profound disruption.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>–</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paigeweicox/">Paige Cox</a>, senior vice president and head of Business Network, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“If 2021 has taught us anything, it is that even the best of predictions failed to anticipate some of the challenges the world has seen. What did occur though was that procurement organizations moved away from simply managing and optimizing processes to becoming pivotal in solving critical business problems. In 2022 procurement professionals should be bold in embracing this mandate and propose solutions that help companies navigate troubled, uncertain waters. Creative procurement solutions can address some of the biggest challenges businesses continue to face today: managing supply shortages, rethinking a globalized supply chain, leaning on a vibrant external workforce in the face of the ‘Great Resignation,’ and focusing on working capital at a time of increasing global inflation. Let’s be bold and re-define traditional paradigms to tackle these challenges.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>–</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bfarooq/">Baber Farooq</a>, head of Market and Solution Strategy, Procurement Solutions, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“By now, it’s fair to assume that all the big gains to make the internal combustion engine more efficient have already taken place. There will always be a place for it in our world, but to make impactful change at this point a bigger pivot is needed, for example, to electric vehicles. I think about automated expense reporting in a similar way. Technology providers can spend increasing amounts of resources to make incremental gains, but a big pivot is needed to usher in the next wave of efficiency and innovation. That big pivot is a shift to settlement. Creating an expense report is never the ultimate goal; the goal is to settle payments for employee-initiated spend. While the expense report isn’t going away any time soon, more innovation will lead to bigger improvements in capturing, processing, and verifying expenses, driven by increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. With this pivot, we will shrink and evaporate expense reports, with a subset of expenses moving to automated settlement and skipping the traditional expense report process entirely.”</p>

        <p>“Sustainability and social responsibility are some of the most pressing issues we’re dealing with today. The recent <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties</a> (<a href="/topics/cop26">COP26</a>) brought representatives from nearly 200 countries together in the fight against climate change. Individuals and businesses alike must heed the urgent call to make drastic changes to help the environment and to stick to ethical principles. I believe that procurement can play an essential role in leading the charge to create a long-term strategy that embeds sustainable and ethical factors in the process from start to finish. While new and emerging solutions are on the horizon to enable these long-term plans, leaders will look to their digital procurement solutions in use today to support environmental, social, and governance goals like reducing carbon emissions or banning child labor. Over the next few years, we’ll see further investment in core procurement technology to help businesses achieve more than just operational efficiencies and cost savings, but also to drive risk mitigation and increased visibility into the supply base and supply chain processes to achieve ESG goals.”</p>

        <p>“Listening to understand customers’ business operations, goals, and expectations is the foundation to building a relationship as a trusted advisor. We have moved well beyond traditional inside-out views of a customer’s situation and transactional sales cycles toward outcome-focused experiences. With the lingering disruption and chaos caused by the pandemic, siloed approaches of solving problems reactively are no longer good enough. Especially as companies are embracing the cloud to increase innovation and propel their digital transformation journeys. Next year we will continue to see many more instances of agile customer-led engagements across channels. These will connect all interactions into an end-to-end solution that addresses customers’ holistic spending needs from procurement to managing an external workforce to capturing travel and expense.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>Holiday shopping is in full swing – at least for the consumers paying attention to supply chain trends.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Those of us in the <a href="/topics/supply-chain-management">supply chain</a> industry understand that disruptions have persisted since March 2020. This has created a mainstream perception of supply chains as increasingly volatile, expensive, and unreliable – but disruption has been more of an intermittent and confusing frustration for most in 2021, instead of the panic-buying and supply-hoarding catalyst it was in 2020.</p>
  <p>Going into the holiday season, some industry insiders are fearful that these disruptions will hit hard again. Supply chain disruptions are forcing companies to think twice about the timing of their holiday sales, and many retailers are warning consumers to get their holiday shopping done early this year to avoid shortages and shipping delays. In fact, many retailers such as Amazon and Target announced their holiday deals much earlier than usual this year, having started in early October rather than late November. Leaving the majority of holiday shopping to Black Friday weekend could lead to many consumers being sorely disappointed with bare shelves, empty online shopping carts, and delayed deliveries.</p>
  <p>With persistent challenges in procurement and the supply chain, SAP surveyed 1,000 American adults to help better understand how they view the latest supply disruptions and their sentiment around the industry overall. Some interesting findings surfaced:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frustration is growing as holiday supply chain challenges loom.</strong> Almost half of consumers (49%) experienced longer ship times during the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic, and 42% expressed frustration with how companies are managing their supply chains. The majority of consumers (83%) also reported experiencing out-of-stock items during the pandemic. Patience is wearing thin, as nearly two-thirds (65%) think companies should have found solutions to supply chain challenges by now.</li>
    <li><strong>Baby boomers have high expectations for gift availability and delivery while millennials and Generation Zers are more skeptical.</strong> Eighty-one percent of baby boomers expect holiday gifts to be available and in stock, compared to 75% of millennials and 60% from Gen Z. Furthermore, 78% of boomers expect gifts to arrive on time, while 63% of millennials and just over half of Gen Z respondents (54%) said the same. Overall, one-third of consumers are planning for the worst, expecting that gifts will <em>not</em> arrive in time for the holidays this year. Having the visibility in place to inform consumers of product availability and delivery timeline is crucial to avoiding disappointment this holiday season.</li>
    <li><strong>Most consumers are forgiving of supply chain mishaps, but not right away.</strong><br>One in 10 consumers say that if a gift they purchase does not arrive on time for the holidays, they would never shop at that retailer again. Another 47% noted that they would not shop with that retail company again immediately, but that they may in the future. No matter how or why it happens, supply chain disruptions hurt brand loyalty among customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivering gifts on time is not the only factor brands need to consider.</strong> Sustainability continues to play a bigger role in consumers’ buying decisions, even when it comes to holiday gifts. This is particularly true among younger consumers, as half of millennials said sustainability influences their gift purchasing decisions. Overall, 39% said they purchase from brands that tout sustainability, while 30% prioritize sustainable practices when making purchases, such as selecting slower shipping to combine packages and reduce waste. Brands can promote sustainability through their own procurement practices by ensuring the products and materials sourced are done so in a sustainable manner – from limiting carbon footprint to sourcing recycled/recyclable materials.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After last year’s chaotic holiday season that had more consumers buying online than ever before, proactive businesses and consumers are adapting their approach this season, especially with ongoing disruption anticipated this year.</p>
  <p>For consumers, as of early October, almost a third (29%) had already changed at least one gift purchase based on supply chain shortages, and only 24% of total respondents expressed that they do not plan to shift their buying behaviors this holiday season. Almost half (45%) are buying earlier, and 44% are buying more online. Millennials are changing their plans the most, with 55% buying earlier than in previous years.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For businesses, agility and visibility are the name of the game. We have all experienced so much disruption from all angles recently, and there’s no going back to “normal” as consumers – and businesses – continue to change buying behaviors.</p>
  <p>Businesses need to broaden visibility not only across their own operations but across those of their trading partners as well, with the dual objectives of <a href="https://www.sap.com/programs/resilient-supply-chain.html">reducing risk and instilling resilience</a>. To achieve this level of transparency, businesses are turning to <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html">digital business networks</a> to capture the widest possible view into the interconnected operations of their trading partners from buyers and suppliers to partners in logistics, finance, and contingent labor. Meanwhile, these digital networks – previously discrete according to function – are beginning to converge through cloud-based applications, unlocking exponential value in the process.</p>
  <p>Consumers and businesses alike have been burned by supply chain issues and shortages during the pandemic, but with the right approach to this holiday season, we can still make it a merry one.</p>

      <div>Discovering opportunities for a business to improve processes and operations does not have to be an exhausting adventure. Sometimes challenges can be seen in broad daylight. That was the case for SuKarne, a <a href="https://www.sukarne.com/">Grupo Viz company based in Mexico</a>, thanks to innovation and technology adoption.</div>

  <h2 id="world-class-and-northern-roots">World Class and Northern Roots</h2>
  <p>With corporate headquarters in Culiacán, Sinaloa, in northern Mexico, SuKarne is one of the four organizations established by <a href="http://www.grupoviz.mx/">Grupo Viz</a>. What emerged 52 years ago as a family initiative is now the third-largest beef fattener in the world and the fifth-largest beef supplier in North America.</p>
  <p>The company’s success has been sustained by an infrastructure consisting of five comprehensive livestock units, four in Mexican territory and one in Nicaragua; seven processing plants, with an installed capacity of 2 million head of cattle per year; 10 distribution centers across Mexico, the U.S., and Central America and 400 distribution routes; more than 220 livestock purchase and conditioning centers; and more than 300 owned stores. In addition, since its facilities have the necessary international sanitary and industrial certifications, SuKarne is a big exporter — its products are available in six countries on four continents. In fact, it is estimated that SuKarne is responsible for 70% of the meat exports of the Mexican economy.</p>
  <p>SuKarne today has 13,000 direct workers, collaborates with more than 100,000 agricultural and livestock suppliers, and serves more than 80,000 customers, such as supermarket chains, although most are micro-businesses like small butchers and restaurants.</p>
  <p>The numbers speak for themselves: the Mexican economy has a true powerhouse in the global market for animal protein.</p>
  <h2 id="first-steps-goodbye-to-paper-based-billing">First Steps: Goodbye to Paper-Based Billing</h2>
  <p>Before adopting SAP Ariba solutions, SuKarne’s Procurement department would not have surprised anyone from an innovation perspective. In fact, as in many organizations, it was a highly traditional corporate area serving a registry of more than 5,000 suppliers, 2,000 of them active, not including suppliers of livestock and raw materials for livestock feed, which are served by another area of ​​the corporation.</p>
  <p>In these circumstances, recalls SuKarne Chief Procurement Officer Gonzalo Padilla, the work was bureaucratic, prone to human errors, and without real business value. “Between 60 and 70% of the team’s time was spent on managing invoices: reviewing them, ensuring that none had been misplaced, and taking them in-person to a colleague’s desk in the Accounts Payable area. All this, despite the fact that electronic invoicing had been implemented in Mexico for a while,” Padilla shares.</p>
  <p>Common mistakes, derived from human execution, were not unusual in this environment: lost or misplaced invoices, which delayed payments and ignited the anger of suppliers; processes interrupted by the modification of a process or corporate policy, and even by the vacations of a person involved in the process; and long sessions at Accounts Payable desks to review and reconcile issues, which tended to cause friction between departments.</p>
  <p>“The Procurement area concentrated on management tasks that did not add business value; we dedicated ourselves to seeking payments and not seeking negotiations,” says Padilla.</p>
  <p>Aware of its challenges and taking advantage of a reorganization that brought Padilla’s team into the Finance department, the Procurement team set out on an innovation journey with the implementation of the <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/strategic-sourcing">SAP Ariba Strategic Sourcing</a> solutions, part of SAP’s Intelligent Spend Management concept.</p>
  <p>Initially, thanks to <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/strategic-sourcing/contract-management-software">SAP Ariba Contracts</a>, the billing processes were digitalized and automated, reducing the administrative and transactional burdens of the team while also reducing human errors and non-essential interactions with the Accounts Receivable area. In this way, the Procurement department was able to focus more on generating value for the business, including conducting strategic negotiations for the company.</p>
  <p>SuKarne’s suppliers were resistant to the new model at first. “They did not see the benefits, perhaps because we were in the initial process of discovering and understanding them, and therefore the process of supplier adoption was slower,” recalls Padilla. “Once the advantages were evident, a communication campaign was implemented that was very important since it showed the benefits: invoices from suppliers would not be parked on a desk and the payments would come out on time.”</p>

      <div><strong><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/e-procurement.html">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Billing was not the only area of improvement. SuKarne also began a digital transformation project encompassing the entire organization, which implied defining and rethinking processes, creating operation manuals, documenting transactions in the various areas, and establishing continuous improvement policies, among other tasks that are essential in these types of innovative initiatives.</p>
  <p>Within this framework, Padilla’s team, taking advantage of the end-to-end source-to-pay solutions – SAP Ariba Strategic Sourcing and <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/procurement/procure-to-pay">SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing</a> – expanded its digital procurement capabilities. After an internal analysis of the different tasks and goals of the Procurement area, multiple opportunities were detected to boost productivity to new levels:</p>
  <p><strong>Self-purchase catalogs</strong></p>
  <p>Taking advantage of the functions of <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/procurement/catalog">SAP Ariba Catalog</a>, self-purchase catalogs were created for items in which Padilla’s department uses prenegotiated contracts. At SuKarne, this tool is already being used for purchases of stationery, general services, materials, and some aspects of marketing. Catalogs are very easy to use, implement, and manage so the company has full visibility and control of transactions. Quality remains high since the catalogs include images of the product, price, characteristics, etc. In addition, the company was able to adapt this resource to its branding, so the catalogs today are known as the “Compras SK” portals.</p>
  <p><strong>Contract generation process</strong></p>
  <p>Before the implementation of SAP Ariba Contracts, when a contract was generated, Legal had to go through an internally developed tool, which provided very basic functionality and did not offer any certainty in terms of time. Now, with SAP Ariba Contracts, from the moment a supplier registers in the SuKarne system, the provider can find all the legal and commercial information they need on the platform. In addition to speeding up activity, this allows for timely monitoring of contracts and easy reviews.</p>
  <p><strong>Audits</strong></p>
  <p>Being part of the agri-food industry, SuKarne is constantly audited by authorities, industrial organizations, institutions, and even clients. An important part of these reviews focuses on suppliers — how they are evaluated, what criteria are used to qualify them, what policies and action plans do they have, etc. SuKarne found a solution in the <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/supplier-management">SAP Ariba Supplier Management</a> portfolio with <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/supplier-management/supplier-lifecycle-management">SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance</a> and <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/supplier-management/supplier-risk">SAP Ariba Supplier Risk</a>. In the past, when an audit was submitted, the company had to put in place a plan to address that specific item. Today, the evaluation of suppliers is carried out all the time, through very friendly, digital tools. When an audit is submitted, SuKarne now has real-time information accessible immediately.</p>
  <p>In order to achieve these advances, a decisive factor, according to Padilla, was the support of the SAP team. “Through seminars and constant support, the team not only explained the capabilities of the solutions to us, but also guided us in the task of adapting existing processes to the platform, how to get more out of the innovation we were adopting,” he says.</p>
  <h2 id="challenge-overcome-the-year-of-the-pandemic">Challenge Overcome: The Year of the Pandemic</h2>
  <p>From Culiacán, SuKarne’s Procurement department continues to explore – and discover – the benefits of investing in innovation. With the guided sourcing and guided buying capabilities within the SAP Ariba solution suite, the company hopes to improve other procurement and sourcing processes and increase the efficiency of Procurement interactions with other corporate divisions.</p>
  <p>These future projects will be led by a totally transformed department – a Procurement team with the capacity to provide value to the business in a new and strategic way. The solutions implemented help ensure SuKarne has complete visibility and robust analytical functions via <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/strategic-sourcing/spend-analysis">SAP Ariba Spend Analysis</a>.</p>
  <p>“The platform allows us to see how the organization’s spending moves; which categories grow the most; which supplier, especially if it is a strategic one, are we ceasing to serve,” comments Padilla. The data obtained is specified in reports, which are sent to SuKarne’s central corporate information system supporting decision-making in the organization.</p>
  <p>In 2020, the year in which the global economy was severely affected by the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>, SuKarne managed to protect its supply chain, which, in turn, safeguarded its business operations.</p>
  <p>“Through the platform, we detected that there were suppliers and categories that were falling. Thanks to the information, we discovered that they were companies facing financial difficulties due to the health crisis, which is why our purchase orders were declining,” Padilla points out. “With regard to strategic suppliers, this allowed us to detect risks to the operation and, in some cases, to think of ways to support them.” And in that sense, another benefit cannot be ignored: technology adoption in an unfavorable economic environment can help to guarantee punctual payments.</p>
  <p>With the support of its Procurement area, 2020 was difficult, but not catastrophic, and SuKarne succeeded in this new context. Beyond operational continuity, the power of technology had a positive impact on suppliers, who could have been most affected by the pandemic.</p>

  <h2 id="opportunity-creates-challenges">Opportunity Creates Challenges</h2>
  <p>After 16 years with Coca-Cola FEMSA, Torres Perez moved into a strategic procurement role about seven years ago. He noticed Coca-Cola FEMSA invested most of its money in direct materials like bottles, labels, caps, and ingredients. He realized an opportunity. “Indirect spend on things like trucks and transportation, industrial tools, and parts was done locally by many, many people.” Torres Perez explains that the process was fragmented and segmented between many suppliers, which did not result in the best prices. “So, I studied how to centralize all those indirect negotiations in a more intelligent way, to really take advantage of the scale that we have as a business,” he says.</p>
  <p>Torres Perez embarked on a challenging journey to integrate Coca-Cola FEMSA processes; it was a course of action that required leadership, patience, learning, and difficult course correction.</p>
  <p>“We needed to change the role of our teams and restructure the procurement employees. But this cannot be done without a technological tool. It was very difficult to convince our management to get the indirect spend all together and change the way we worked in the past. It took us more than a year to start. At first, we chose a competitor of SAP.” Torres Perez recalls that the technology was fraught with problems. “The integration of that competitor’s solution was not there.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Torres Perez found himself facing both personal and professional dilemmas.</p>
  <p>“I’d sold Coca-Cola FEMSA leaders on the idea of managing negotiations centrally, and they bought the idea. But when [the competitor’s product] didn’t work, it was really… I mean, my own reputation was at stake because I told them, ‘We can do this.’ But I was not able to deliver,” says Torres Perez. “I mean, it was a very difficult situation, because I had to go back to our management and ask them to switch gears again. This time to implement SAP Ariba instead of the other solution.”</p>
  <p>Coca-Cola FEMSA’s leadership ultimately trusted Torres Perez and suggested that he implement <a href="/topics/network-spend-management">SAP Ariba</a> in a limited capacity, in Colombia only. And this time? Success.</p>
  <p>“We implemented SAP Ariba on time and on cost, but the most important part: It worked and it worked fantastically. It was a very smooth transition and, once it was working, everybody was amazed.” Torres Perez soon got permission for a full rollout of SAP Ariba to all countries where Coca-Cola FEMSA operates. “This is a huge step forward.”</p>
  <h2 id="advice">Advice?</h2>
  <p>Torres shares his technology story with the hope of inspiring his peers. “Let me tell you one thing: No matter how challenging an enterprise can be, if you have the correct partner, you’re always flying with a tailwind. That’s the most important lesson that I got from this process. And, once we worked with SAP Ariba, things got better and we were able to implement the solution easily.”</p>

      <div>Today marks a big step forward in SAP’s mission to deliver the solutions organizations need to extend digitalization beyond the four walls of their businesses – transforming today’s fragmented supply chains into unified, collaborative, and intelligent networks.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Businesses can no longer focus on only digitalizing their internal processes. Achieving true agility and resiliency in today’s networked economy requires a network strategy that enables organizations to collaborate with their most critical trading partners and see into their supply chains.</p>
  <p>Today at SAPPHIRE NOW, <a href="/">we announced SAP Business Network</a>, an innovative new solution that reimagines how businesses collaborate with their network of trading partners and will empower companies to unify all the points of interaction and integration across that network to move faster and smarter than ever before.</p>

  <p>The unified experience provides trading partners with a holistic view into all their customer relationships and transactions on the network. On its home page, the all new workbench enables users to customize their experience and maximize their responsiveness to customer needs. Key capabilities of the new SAP Business Network trading partner experience available now include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Centralized access to explore and collaborate with customers</li>
    <li>Intelligent trading partner onboarding and registration and new collaboration scenarios</li>
    <li>Highly configurable workbench enabling user-based personalization by role</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to the new trading partner experience, buyers and trading partners can collaborate using shared data and workflows, applying network-wide intelligence to inform decisions. New services are also being made available to trading partners, such as working capital financing. Additional capabilities planned for availability later this year include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time global track and trace integrated to the purchase order application, enhancing supply chain visibility</li>
    <li>New working capital solution for trading partners with SAP Supplier Financing, providing access to a network of lenders to help improve cash flow</li>
    <li>Insights and benchmarking to compare performance with industry peers, improving customer service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And we will continue to execute on our vision for SAP Business Network, integrating SAP’s leading business networks — including Ariba Network, SAP Logistics Business Network, and SAP Asset Intelligence Network — to unify business processes across supplier collaboration, logistics coordination and traceability, and asset intelligence. This strategy will help customers and their trading partners to become more agile and resilient in the face of changing market dynamics and increasingly complex supply chains as well as drive better business outcomes.</p>
  <h2 id="trading-partners-report-success">Trading Partners Report Success</h2>
  <p>Customer feedback and input is crucial as SAP integrates and evolves the individual market-leading networks into a truly unmatched unified business network. We collaborated with our customers to guide the design and development of the new trading partner portal with their most important needs in mind. Their continued feedback has been invaluable and will continue to inform future innovations for SAP Business Network.</p>
  <p>Here is what some of them had to say about their participation in our early adopter program:</p>
  <p>“SAP Business Network allows us to communicate with our customers in real-time. The reliability of the platform gives us unparalleled visibility and connectivity with our most critical customers even in changing business environments.”</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><em>Ray Pan, IT Customer Technology Manager, Komatsu Mining Corp. Group</em></p>
  <p>“Technological change in the way of doing business has been happening for some time, and the current global situation has accelerated this process. Today more than ever we need to be at the forefront of this transformation. SAP Business Network has helped us develop more efficient formulas in order to better respond to the needs of the industry.”</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><em>David Labbe, Digital Business Manager, Reliper Comercial Ltda.</em></p>
  <p>A unified network will enable all trading partners to leverage combined intelligence to apply learning from past experiences to future decisions, ultimately driving success across the board. Because when a network reaches across functions, across industries, across the world, companies have the power to reshape how business gets done, including collaborating to solve some of today’s biggest social, economic, and environmental issues.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>April marks my first six months back with SAP, now leading the Product Engineering organization focused on our intelligent spend and business network solutions. I came back because of our strong foundation.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We continue to invest and innovate to help customers move to the cloud, with no better example than the tremendous value companies continue to gain from both our acquired and organically developed solutions across SAP Ariba, SAP Fieldglass, SAP Concur, and SAP S/4HANA Procurement. Each solution set in our business unit is market-leading in its own right.</p>
  <p>I’m also excited because we are in a unique position to deliver a next-generation network-driven spend management solution suite that addresses all spend — everything a company spends money on except for payroll — connected to a vast and growing digital business network.</p>
  <p>The past six months have been tumultuous for everyone, to say the least. There have been a variety of supply risks and business disruptions: the ongoing pandemic, geopolitical unrest, and severe weather that slowed supply in different parts of the world. Most recently is the reminder <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cargo-ship-stuck-suez-canal-egypt-d8b6696716ab45794cba583ecf0e4001">that even one single ship</a> can impact tens of billions of dollars of supply every day.</p>
  <p>While highlighting the importance of having resilient procurement and supply chain operations, these events have also emphasized the obligations of technology companies — we need to ensure that our customers have the tools to assess such risks and rapidly execute alternatives. The opportunities for digital transformation and leveraging business networks are at the heart of facilitating such data-driven decision-making, and it is why I believe SAP is best suited to deliver on this promise for our customers.</p>
  <p>These lessons learned during recent disruptions combined with new processes and ways for doing business will pay huge dividends in the long term. In many ways, they already have.</p>
  <h2 id="what-intelligent-spend-and-business-network-really-means">What Intelligent Spend and Business Network Really Means</h2>
  <p>My job is to make sure that SAP continues to pioneer and lead the market with intelligent spend management and business network solutions that solve our customers’ greatest pain points, while tapping into the broader SAP portfolio so customers benefit from a completely integrated suite. Our mission is to deliver the solutions our customers use to align every spend decision to their business strategy in the networked economy.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, that means we focus every day on developing the best possible solutions to help our customers spend smarter and drive impact for their organizations and communities. Along with delivering business outcomes, we also want to help our customers take a stakeholder view into how their overall spend management function works.</p>
  <p>This commitment is reflected directly in our capabilities, in which we continue to invest to meet customer needs. They are historically strong and market-leading individually and will be even stronger far into the future as we continue to integrate and evolve best of breed into a truly unmatched best of suite.</p>
  <p>Like our customers, we don’t only think for the short term. We have a long-term commitment to seamless capabilities developed over time.</p>
  <h2 id="our-commitment-to-capabilities">Our Commitment to Capabilities</h2>
  <p>At SAP, our vision for procurement is focused on three core areas: One Procurement, Travel and Expense, and Business Network.</p>

  <h3 id="procurement">Procurement</h3>
  <p>We introduced the concept of One Procurement last year and, quite frankly, it generated a lot of questions. It’s on us to set the record straight: One Procurement is our vision for the future of procurement, how we bring innovations like artificial intelligence (AI) and insights to our customers. The idea of One Procurement may have been misconstrued as a single product destination, when in reality it’s truly a journey, centered around our market-leading SAP S/4HANA, SAP Ariba, and SAP Fieldglass solutions. We cover all categories of spend — direct, indirect, and services, including contingent and external workforce — with one strategy for the continual innovation our customers want to solve their business pain points. Our recently released <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/strategic-sourcing/sourcing-solutions?campaigncode=CRM-IS20-PRL-OOCWA06">guided sourcing capabilities in the SAP Ariba Sourcing solution</a> is an example of innovation that falls into the One Procurement vision.</p>
  <p>We are committed to maximizing each asset in our portfolio to enable procurement to drive business productivity, an end state that we call autonomous procurement. Autonomous procurement is an essential part of our intelligent enterprise strategy, with end-to-end integration and embedded intelligence that allow customers to streamline and automate procurement processes and thereby focus on more high-value tasks.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, as part of One Procurement, we are committed to continued superiority in services procurement and <a href="https://www.fieldglass.com/solutions/contingent-workforce-management">contingent workforce</a> management with our SAP Fieldglass solutions. As we start recovering from the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>, it is expected that many of our customers will turn to leveraging flexible external workers. To support this, we recently launched <a href="https://www.fieldglass.com/solutions/assignment-management?campaigncode=CRM-PR21-FIP-FGAMLAUPRM">SAP Fieldglass Assignment Management</a>, a brand new solution that helps organizations manage contractors performing ad hoc work under existing supplier agreements. The most <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/9-future-of-work-trends-post-covid-19/">recent findings from Gartner</a> show that the external workforce is fast-growing and versatile, supporting organizational needs of all shapes and sizes. We continue to invest in SAP Fieldglass solutions and their ability to help companies streamline and scale external workforce management to help maximize their investments and meet business needs.</p>
  <h3 id="travel-and-expense">Travel and Expense</h3>
  <p>We are committed to continue leading the travel and expense management market, which has been significantly disrupted in the past 12 months. Similar to how we supported B2B spend via SAP Ariba solutions, we’ve developed capabilities in SAP Concur solutions to better manage organizational spend as well. Our <a href="https://www.concur.com/newsroom/article/leverage-expense-category-summaries-to-keep-spend-budget-on-track">spend management assessment</a> tool helps streamline and guide employee discretionary spend, helping keep budgets on track and align spending with business goals.</p>

  <p>We are committed to driving value through a digital business network, helping our customers connect with buyers and suppliers via <a href="https://www.ariba.com/ariba-network">Ariba Network</a>, connect asset operators with original equipment manufacturers and services providers with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/asset-intelligence-network.html">SAP Asset Intelligence Network</a>, and collaborate on logistics, including tracking and tracing goods and materials, on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/logistics-business-network.html">SAP Logistics Business Network</a>. These networks are all strong on their own, and their combined power enables customers to manage their global supply chains from start to finish. The integration among networks is a key area of focus for us going forward, offering customers the advantages of a common data model, set of services, intelligence, and analytics engine. In this environment, processes and data flow freely and securely across functions and workflows.</p>
  <p>No one can predict the future, but I am certainly optimistic. We are dedicated to helping customers on their journeys to achieve real-time intelligent spend management aligned to the business so they can best prepare to be agile in the face of disruption, because let’s face it: disruption is <em>expected</em>. We just never know when or from where it will come.</p>
  <p>All companies have unique challenges within the common context of today’s disrupted global business environment. Our technology has evolved alongside our customers and will continue to do so – whether that’s SAP Ariba, SAP Fieldglass, SAP Concur, or SAP S/4HANA solutions, elements of each, or all of the above. We are a long-standing leader in spend management because of the breadth and variety of our solutions and our deep expertise in business process transformation across industries. Our investments in providing outcome-oriented solutions to complex problems will continue to be guided by our customers’ needs.</p>

      <div>The workforce you need today isn’t the same as it was yesterday – and it will undoubtedly be different tomorrow. To <a href="https://insights.sap.com/importance-upskilling/">stay competitive</a>, organizations are capitalizing on a well-managed, dynamic, and flexible external workforce. And SAP Preferred Success can help reveal yours with the visibility and insight of SAP Fieldglass solutions.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>While navigating an economy that is reshaping customer demand, business models, and industries in unpredictable ways, executives are just as concerned about their company’s recovery readiness. Just days before the onset of the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/03/24/the-coronavirus-crisis-thrusts-corporate-hr-chiefs-into-the-spotlight">The Economist</a> revealed that four-fifths of CEOs worried about skill gaps, up from half in 2012.</p>
  <p>As the marketplace continues to evolve, concern over skill shortages is intensifying. In response, businesses are relying more on contingent talent, comprising 42 percent of the average workforce spend according to <a href="https://www.fieldglass.com/resources/research/contingent-workforce-insights-2019/download">Oxford Economics</a>. Sometimes, we even hear organizational managers say that their company couldn’t conduct business as usual without the support of independent contractors, freelancers, temporary staff, and service providers.</p>
  <p>Despite the importance of external workers, most CEOs and senior leaders do not have fast, easy access to information on them. This reality is not as uncommon as you may think. In fact, this lack of visibility that limits compliance, governance, cost control, and resource optimization prompts many companies to implement <a href="https://www.fieldglass.com/">SAP Fieldglass</a> solutions. And with the assistance of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/services/support-plans/preferred-success-cloud.html">SAP Preferred Success</a> offering, our customers are aligning their workforce practices with business needs in real time.</p>

  <h2 id="uncovering-workforce-value-outside-the-payroll">Uncovering Workforce Value Outside the Payroll</h2>
  <p>Every business wants the best talent – on the payroll or not – that can help see them through times of disruption, uncertainty, and prosperity. They need knowledgeable people who can get the job done efficiently, timely, and with an edge that further differentiates the brand. And most importantly, executives expect high-quality outcomes at a fair price and the ability to quickly identify talent that could be a valuable candidate for an open role or leadership position.</p>
  <p>Bringing these expectations to life requires a system of checks and balances when managing workers hired outside the payroll. This capability involves workflow automation that serves as a single point for compliance auditing, assignment administration, communication, and delivery of work items. External workforce information should also be integrated seamlessly with modern enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to trigger invoicing and payment; cost analysis; and HR processes such as onboarding, badging, security checks, technology access, and laptop distribution.</p>
  <p>Our customers find that SAP Fieldglass solutions are well-suited to support such a digital transformation. But to optimize their adoption of the vendor management system, they often want insight-driven, prescriptive, and personalized support to determine <a href="https://www.fieldglass.com/solutions/contingent-workforce-management">contingent workforce</a> goals that complement their business strategies and address talent management disparities.</p>
  <p>SAP Preferred Success gives the guidance that our customers seek. With a comprehensive portfolio of exclusive success plans and support expertise, organizations can identify opportunities for cost savings, process automation, and adoption of business networks to allow qualified contingent workers to bid against each other. Tailored functional learning, change management, and enhanced support capabilities are also offered to help implement new solutions, establish new processes and refine existing ones, and foster business-wide adoption.</p>
  <p>Perhaps as its most critical advantage, SAP Preferred Success offers continuous support throughout our customers’ transformation journey. We give organizations the freedom to fully understand emerging trends and consider how they relate to their business needs, workforce capabilities, and digital strategies. These developments may include recently passed labor regulations, rising demand for new skills, evolving market forces, and shifts in business direction.</p>
  <p>Semiannually, SAP Fieldglass solutions are updated to fulfill the changing landscape of external workforce management. However, we also understand that our customers must also strategically choose capabilities based on current requirements and scale the technology as the contingent workforce fluctuates. Access to the latest release notes, solutions road maps, and real-life best practices allows our customers to make informed decisions that meet their unique needs.</p>

  <p>Every workshop, design-thinking session, update release, and process change allows them to make connections between business goals, defined success metrics, and the role of external employees. This level of visibility enables them to look beyond the day-to-day minutia to think about their entire workforce on and off the payroll – opening the door to the talent they need.</p>
