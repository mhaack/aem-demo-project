  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Employee satisfaction is driven by more than paychecks and perks – it’s also about everyday work experiences. One often-overlooked aspect that can significantly impact how employees feel about their workplace is the benefits enrollment experience.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A confusing benefits enrollment experience is a significant source of frustration for many employees and can leave them feeling uncertain about their benefits elections. The majority of employees struggle to understand their benefits options and navigate through the enrollment process.</p>
  <p>As a result, many employees choose to simply roll over their previous year’s elections rather than review and update their choices to ensure they are getting the most out of their benefits. This often leads to missed opportunities to take advantage of lower-cost options or benefits that are a better fit for them and their family and can even lead to increased attrition of top talent.</p>
  <p>With <a href="/2024/04/sap-successfactors-first-half-2024-release">the first half 2024 release</a>, updates to the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-central-hris/features.html#benefits?url_id=ctabutton-us-hcm-EC-freetrial">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Global Benefits</a> solution can enable you to empower your employees to take control of their benefits with an intuitive guided enrollment experience.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Rapidly evolving technology presents endless possibilities for enhancing the user experience (UX). SAP is seizing this moment to usher in a new era of efficiency, productivity, and engagement for businesses and their employees by integrating HR processes into the flow of work.</div>

        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html#active_tab_item_1680651733277">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A prime example of this modern digital shift in UX is embedding high-value, critical HR tasks directly into the applications employees use daily. By integrating <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a> with other workplace technology solutions, SAP enables people to perform HR tasks without interrupting their daily work.</p>
  <p>All of us have seen how artificial intelligence (AI) can increase process efficiency and productivity, reduce human errors, and elevate user standards. But UX will change the most as the potential for new AI capabilities and models is expanded to address pressing business needs and employee expectations.</p>
  <h2 id="shaping-the-user-experience-with-a-purpose">Shaping the User Experience with a Purpose</h2>
  <p>Whether predictive, conversational, or generative, advancements in business AI are expected to bring the most significant shift in how people use technology at work.</p>
  <p>By investing in AI to strengthen SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite, SAP supports how people naturally interact, get work done, and leverage technology in the workplace. And best of all, we are doing it ethically by following our guiding principles to be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Helping users get greater insights and perform tasks more efficiently with AI designed with business context in mind to enhance the flow of work</li>
    <li><strong>Reliable:</strong> Using AI that is trained on the customer’s industry and company data and accessible in the solutions used each day</li>
    <li><strong>Responsible:</strong> Running responsible AI built on leading ethics and data privacy standards while maintaining full governance and lifecycle management across an entire organization</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By only employing AI technology that meets our stringent standards, we help our customers ensure the delivery of a meaningful and engaging UX for their entire workforce. Doing so allows employees to not only reach their full potential but also feel accomplished, supported, and engaged.</p>
  <p>For instance, HR professionals and their stakeholders are unlocking higher engagement and productivity for their employees, organizations, and businesses through their recruitment and talent development processes. One of the ways this is being accomplished is by unifying SAP SuccessFactors solutions with leading business productivity applications such as Microsoft Teams and further enhancing that integration with AI embedded in SAP SuccessFactors solutions to generate suggestions and recommendations using natural language.</p>
  <p>This business-oriented AI innovation represents some of the fundamental changes SAP is creating to transform how people will experience work in the years to come.</p>
  <h2 id="future-ready-hr-for-a-future-ready-workforce">Future-Ready HR for a Future-Ready Workforce</h2>
  <p>Our AI-enabled use cases for SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite are exceptional evidence of how HR tasks — from talent acquisition and talent management to core HR processes — can become a natural extension of people’s everyday work experience.</p>
  <p>Consider the value of these scenarios heavily used in the recruiting process:</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Creating Job Descriptions</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hiring managers and recruiters can fine-tune job descriptions with generative AI within the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting solution. This allows them to incorporate supplementary content, identify biased language, and help ensure alignment with business requirements. Once the final version is approved by the appropriate hiring manager and assigned recruiter, the job description can be published in SAP SuccessFactors solutions.</p>
  <p>Instead of starting from scratch every time a new position is created or requirements are updated, recruiters and hiring managers can draft job descriptions faster and stay in their normal flow of work. And more importantly, the final content is more meaningful, inclusive, and competitive — attracting a larger pool of qualified and interested candidates.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Interviewing Candidates</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hiring managers can construct unbiased and more effective interview questions by using AI-generated prompts, creating an exceptional impression on the candidate and leading to the right decision for both parties.</p>
  <p>Recruiters and hiring managers can also provide their assessment of candidates throughout the process through Microsoft Teams, which is then captured by SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting for further evaluation.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Innovation is built into the DNA at <a href="https://bluestonex.com/">Bluestonex</a> – it’s what makes it tick. As part of SAP AppHaus Network, it shifted its entire business processes to run on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), making this boutique team the perfect advocate for converting its own customers to the tech platform.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Recognized for design, innovation, and user experience, Bluestonex began using the application development and integration capabilities of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP BTP</a> in 2018, then known as SAP Cloud Platform, because of its speed and agility.</p>
  <p>“Being an innovation partner, we wanted to be able to move and deliver quickly for our customers,” explains Dan Barton, COO and co-founder. “SAP BTP allows us to do that. Plus, the low-cost, high-impact nature of the platform is always going to be an attractive proposition to customers. So, it was a clear route for us as a business and for our customers.”</p>
  <p>Bluestonex sees itself as a true integration of a client’s team, holding their hands as they shift to SAP BTP. They work with customers of all shapes and sizes and from cross-industry sectors, everything from food and drinks to aerospace. However, Barton is clear that SAP BTP breaks down any misconceptions that SAP is purely for larger-sized businesses.</p>
  <p>“It’s very, very well-suited to micro-businesses. It’s agile, it’s low-cost from an entry point of view, and it has a huge number of capabilities that can grow over time. SAP BTP has opened up new opportunities for us within the micro-business market because, typically, there isn’t another product out there to match it.”</p>
  <p>Barton says customers can often become “over-awed” when faced with all the different tech products available to run and manage businesses. He and the team use SAP BTP to “transform that user experience.”</p>
  <p>“It’s a really easy entry point: instead of people having to use multiple clicks and screen jumps, SAP BTP gets rid of that. It streamlines and strips away complexity to give a consistent user experience,” Barton explains. “And that transformation is key. When they realize what a nice platform it is, it opens the door to other experiences, such as chatbots and automation. It’s all there and plugs in really nicely. Lots of customers love the fact that they can start small and grow with the platform.”</p>
  <div class="promo">

      <div><strong><a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/network">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It also helps Bluestonex to grow as a business, driving its specialism in innovation and, in turn, encouraging customers to think in new ways. “This is a massive shift, not only are they going from running different processes into one, smooth, easy-to-use platform, we’re seeing a big cultural shift in the way our customers think,” he adds.</p>
  <p>Being part of SAP AppHaus Network means Bluestonex can access the latest, state-of-the-art design thinking methodologies, helping to move customers to new digital experiences.</p>
  <p>From its converted chapel office space, Bluestonex regularly invites customers in to co-innovate.</p>
  <p>“We invite our customers here and bring them out of their comfort zone,” says Barton. “And we have a usability lab where we get customer input on an idea as early in the development process as possible, so that key stakeholders know what they’re going to get and can be part of the iteration process. This helps to set expectations and build a better business case.”</p>
  <p>To sum up SAP BTP in three words? “Strategic, innovative, and responsive,” he says. “It’s opened a different angle for us. We would always go and speak to our existing SAP customers, but this is different. Now we go to a competitor’s customer, we go to micro-businesses, because it’s flexible and cost effective. SAP BTP is a very strategic platform: there’s a sense that whatever a business does in the future, that platform is going to be there and continue to add value. It’s future-proof and I’m a massive advocate for it.”</p>

      <div>Historically, exceptional situations always give innovations a nudge. When the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> hit, companies of all sizes and areas of business had to rethink the ways their workforce would work best in the ‘new normal.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Many companies have always been investing heavily in how their workforce can work best, whether they are developers, sales and services employees, or in administration. Each has individual needs, but what they all have in common is that they need access to a computer in order to fulfill their tasks. They use a keyboard, a mouse, and touch as the de-facto, standard interaction with the machine. This technology hasn’t evolved much over recent years.</p>
  <p>At offices, we are used to working according to ergonomic standards whereas in our home offices we may not have these standards available.</p>

  <h2 id="next-generation-of-user-experience--from-touch-less-to-touchless">Next Generation of User Experience – From ‘Touch Less’ to ‘Touchless’</h2>
  <p>Did you know that, on average, 25% of a work day is spent using a mouse, accounting for thousands of clicks and scrolls? We switch between the keyboard and mouse up to 2,000 times per day. In an internal pilot at SAP with 35 users from different departments, almost 500 kilometers of mouse-movement distance was measured within six weeks.</p>
  <p>This not only costs a lot of time but also causes stress-related diseases, such as repetitive strain injuries (RSI), also known as ‘mouse arm.’</p>
  <p>With the eye-tracking solution NUIA from SAP partner <a href="/2020/05/ai-gaze-control-help-businesses-reopen">4tiitoo GmbH Munich</a>, it is possible to provide an innovative tool to employees, working to address their ergonomic situation, reduce mouse movements and mouse-keyboard swaps, and improve efficiency and appearance during customer calls.</p>
  <p>All SAP colleagues can order this solution to use in the office and even their home offices.</p>
  <p>Following its <a href="/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2021/06/01/pledge-to-flex.pdf">pledge to flex</a>, SAP’s future of work plans include monitors equipped with eye-trackers by default and the ability to download necessary software just by scanning a QR code.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Mindset applied the design thinking process to reimagine the field service experience for Patterson Companies, a leading distribution and service company that serves the dental and animal health markets in North America and the UK.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It brought together field service technicians, business leadership, and IT experts to create a new mobile app that improved customer satisfaction, gave employees time back every day, and will continue to save Patterson over US$1.3 million annually. With just a few user experience (<a href="/topics/user-experience">UX</a>) champions, a diverse group of stakeholders was created to focus on empathy, find the real problem, and deliver an innovative solution.</p>

  <h2 id="modern-field-service-processes-require-access-from-anywhere">Modern Field Service Processes Require Access from Anywhere</h2>
  <p>The technical service team at Patterson spends much of its time at customer sites. Field technicians provide dentists and veterinary offices with the expertise, products, and services they need to keep their practices running smoothly and efficiently. Patterson’s customer experience sets it apart from other distributors. Not only does it sell and install products, but it provides services to make sure dentists’ equipment runs smoothly.</p>
  <p>Prior to working with Mindset to develop a mobile solution, the technicians needed to be back at the office or their home each night to load the information from their service appointments into the SAP system that ran the business.</p>
  <h2 id="walking-in-the-customers-shoes-and-riding-in-their-trucks">Walking in the Customer’s Shoes and Riding in Their Trucks</h2>
  <p>Patterson’s director of Technical Field Service and vice president of IT reached out to design thinking expert and UX champion, Mindset. To gain a complete understanding of the problem and underlying business processes, Mindset decided to team up with several field service reps for a series of “ride-alongs.” By riding in service tech vans, going on real service calls, and getting to know and interact with the service techs, Mindset project managers got a unique perspective on the pain technicians go through to deliver great service every day. This would prove very helpful when facilitating the design thinking sessions with a broader team.</p>
  <h2 id="with-design-thinking-people-focus-on-what-matters-most">With Design Thinking, People Focus on What Matters Most</h2>
  <p>After capturing the preliminary information from traveling to multiple sites in the field, Mindset set up a design thinking workshop at <a href="https://experience.sap.com/designservices/location/minneapolis">SAP AppHaus Minneapolis</a>, a space created specifically to cater to such workshops.</p>
  <p>The workshop included the technicians from the field research, business sponsors, IT experts, and Mindset facilitators. Jonathan Bragg of Mindset served as Patterson’s principal UX architect. Getting everyone together made a big difference in building empathy for everyone’s needs. The ability to ask “why” across roles led to a deeper understanding of the current situation and problems along the entire process flow.</p>
  <p>The design thinking workshop followed the typical steps for problem finding, problem solving, and iteration.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Empathize:</strong>– By bringing various stakeholders together, everyone was able to understand how their part of the process affected the entire company. In many cases, it was the first time the field service reps had a chance to speak with IT directly.</li>
    <li><strong>Define:</strong> Once everyone understood the overall situation with the current field service software, which was based on SAP Customer Relationship Management (SAP CRM), they were able to work as a team to narrow the scope and create a clear problem statement. Since the field service technicians spend most of their time at customer sites, one of the key requirements was that the solution needed to have a mobile-optimized design.</li>
    <li><strong>Ideate:</strong> With a clear problem definition, the cross-functional team suggested many ideas for improvement that spanned the entire business process. Not only did this make it easier to enter data during service calls, it also improved how Patterson used the information downstream to improve customer service and reduce company costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> During the workshop, the Mindset experts were able to create prototypes, gather feedback, and make improvements in an iterative and agile manner. With the insight from the design thinking session, they were able to develop an <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/">SAP Fiori</a> app that could be tested in the field.</li>
    <li><strong>Test:</strong> The initial pilot version went to a group of 17 technicians in 17 locations. This allowed for further refinement of the app, using agile methodology to put new functionality into people’s hands quickly to see what worked and what needed further refinement.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Throughout the process, a dedicated product owner from Patterson helped the Mindset team prioritize development and ensure the features they developed addressed the user stories that were documented during the workshop.</p>

        <p>The discussions in the workshop revealed that without a dedicated mobile app, field reps needed to return to the office or their home to enter details from their site visits. Besides being inconvenient, the complexity of a desktop screen sometimes led to data inconsistencies. During the prototyping phase, it became clear that adding validations into each step of a linear process would be successful in ensuring that only clean data can go into the system. Once they focused on this pain point, they were able to make small modifications to the app that accommodated the checks and balances they wanted to build into the new service process that weren’t available in the original system.</p>
        <p>The initial plan was to create a native iOS application. During the field observations, the team learned that not all the technicians had iPhones. Since SAP Fiori was already used in other areas at Patterson, the developers decided to create an SAP Fiori app that runs in a browser so it could be used on any device.</p>
        <h2 id="intuitive-screens-lead-to-high-adoption-and-measurable-business-benefits">Intuitive Screens Lead to High Adoption and Measurable Business Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The new app was so compelling to use, that over a four-month period, 85% of the field reps chose the new app over the old process. The number of clicks and associated time to complete various processes dropped by over 50%.</li>
          <li>Better visibility into order status allowed the company to focus its resources and reduce the number of orders open longer than 60 days from 13,000 to 4,000. This translated into $1.3 million in annual savings for Patterson.</li>
          <li>On the human side, technicians were able to complete the administrative part of their jobs more quickly, so they were happier. And, they were able to check on tasks from anywhere, so they could be more responsive to their customers’ needs, adding to their job satisfaction. With the ability to complete work remotely, people could bypass a trip to the office for “paperwork” and switch to relaxation mode when they got home, rather than staring at their computer to document tasks they had completed hours earlier.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="digitalization-will-drive-further-business-improvements">Digitalization Will Drive Further Business Improvements</h2>
        <p>The design thinking approach is more than just bringing a bunch of people into a conference room, either physically or virtually, and expecting magic to happen. If you have the right facilitators, who can ask the right questions, and the right development team, who can build apps quickly and make updates based on user feedback, along with the key business stakeholders, you greatly increase the chances of success. If you lack the skills in your organization, then bringing in an outside expert is a great way to gain the results you want while learning the process.</p>

    <div>
      <div>One of the key applications on the OP 4.1 platform prototype is the <strong>OP 4.1 dashboard</strong>. Designed to help provide surgical teams with relevant information at the right time, it leaves them free to focus on what matters most: their patients.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>At each phase of a surgical operation, the OP 4.1 dashboard displays data pulled from various sources according to need, providing surgical teams with vital information in a way that makes it easy for them to consume it. The data they need for an operation appears on a 47-inch touchscreen monitor placed between three and five meters from the operating table, where anesthetists, surgeons, and other medical and nursing staff can see it clearly.</p>
  <p>The monitor’s main function is to display all the information about a patient and the operation he or she is undergoing at the precise stage in the process when the medical team needs it – before, during, and after surgery.</p>
  <div class="promo">

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="end-user-focus-a-principle-of-ux-design">End-User Focus a Principle of UX Design</h2>
  <p>User experience (UX) design provides the foundation. UX designers start with the software user’s story and work backwards to create a design that will deliver maximum benefit. Thus the design and development process for the OP 4.1 dashboard began with a detailed assessment of how modern surgical teams work today.</p>
  <p>When a patient has surgery, the information the medical staff need about that patient comes from different sources and in different formats/ Medical records are usually paper-based; patients often supply visual material, such as CT and x-ray images and the like, on a USB flash drive or similar; lab results are displayed on a PC, like in Cerner i.s.h. med from SAP; and patient consent forms are submitted on paper.</p>
  <p>As a result, the medical staff have to draw together the information they need from multiple sources themselves. They can then plan the operation. Once at the operating table, the surgical team has to cognitively link existing patient data with the information that is generated during the operation as they work. This is where the OP 4.1 dashboard comes in – its aim being to bundle information and display it precisely as and when the operating team needs it. For that to happen, it is vital that the dashboard’s design is as user-centric as possible.</p>
  <h2 id="how-the-dashboard-was-developed">How the Dashboard Was Developed</h2>
  <p>The first task for the dashboard’s designers was to identify all the different sources of information and to find out – by holding user research sessions – what data was required at which point during surgery. Thanks to these sessions, the designers not only learned a lot of detail about surgical processes, they also discovered a great deal about the needs and wishes of the operating teams. On top of that, Heidelberg University Clinic arranged for the UX designers to sit in on operations and observe surgeons as they worked.</p>
  <p>Equipped with the input they had gathered, the designers were able to build a basic grid layout, which then passed through several iterations before achieving its current look. Using this design approach means that end users are involved in development processes and can provide validation along the way.</p>

    <li>On the left-hand side of the dashboard is an accordion drop-down menu listing the various phases of surgery.</li>
    <li>The shell bar at the very top of the screen shows the operating room logged on as a user. Here, the operating surgeon can also make the appropriate settings for the operation. The shell bar also contains the voice interaction icon.</li>
    <li>Directly below the shell bar is the header. This permanently displays key basic information – such as the total duration of the operation and a stopwatch – that is relevant for all the defined user personas.</li>
    <li>On the far right of the screen is the app drawer, a slide-out side panel displaying third-party apps that medical staff have defined in advance as relevant for the operation.</li>
    <li>The content area in the center of the screen contains various tiles that change dynamically at each stage of the operation. They summarize all the relevant information and make it visible at a glance. Some of the tiles can also be opened to display more detailed information. The content area is also scrollable so that content can be accessed quickly if the operating surgeon has activated more tiles in the settings than can be displayed simultaneously on the screen.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Further user research sessions were held to validate this layout with the medical teams. In this way, the dashboard was optimized in several iterations to meet the needs of the two main personas: anesthetists and surgeons.</p>
  <p>Once this process was complete, the design was discussed with the SAP UX team to help ensure that it aligned as closely as possible with SAP’s current design language and guidelines, in this case, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/fiori.html">SAP Fiori 3</a> Quartz dark theme.</p>
  <h2 id="app-guidelines-for-third-party-providers">App Guidelines for Third-Party Providers</h2>
  <p>In addition, special design specifications were developed for applications from third-party providers. These were implemented in the first apps built for the dashboard by the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and mbits imaging GmbH and validated with end users.</p>
  <p>The third-party apps deviate from the SAP Fiori 3 Quartz dark theme guidelines used in the dashboard because, unlike the dashboard, they require certification as medical products. Nevertheless, the app designs are closely aligned to the look and feel of the dashboard that end users do not perceive any difference.</p>
  <h2 id="focus-on-the-patient">Focus on the Patient</h2>
  <p>The aim in designing this clearly structured dashboard was to make it as easy as possible for users to work with, and to put patients front and center. The dashboard helps surgical teams focus their skills and energy on their core tasks and, as such, supports gentle, successful, and efficient surgery. And by leveraging digital technology and connectivity in the operating room in this way, it provides a compelling insight into future possibilities that could benefit everyone.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>When people think of user research, the first thing that probably comes to mind is conducting surveys on the usability of a product. Yet user research is much more than that.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To find out what user research really means for the IT business and how it can be beneficial for your work, I spoke to Uwe Betzin, a user experience (UX) design expert at SAP.</p>

  <h2 id="from-development-to-ux-design">From Development to UX Design</h2>
  <p>Betzin is someone you would describe as a change maker. When he first joined SAP in 2003, he began his career as a developer. For the next 12 years, he worked in development and was always looking for guidelines or best practices on how to get things done because he felt like he lacked the same “that’s the way to do it!” spirit his colleagues seemed to have.</p>
  <p>When asked to create a user interface (UI), Betzin came across a UX basics training. With it, he was not only introduced to user experience but as a result decided to become a UX advocate, dedicating half of his working time to that role. As a UX advocate for his development team, he brought together team, domain, and UX knowledge.</p>
  <p>Betzin soon realized his true passion wasn’t development but UX design, which is why he decided to do a six-month fellowship in the SAP Business Suite UX team. Eventually, this led him to change his user research career path. Ever since, his vision has been to get customers excited about using application software because it gets their job done easily.</p>

  <p>To create software that meets customer requirements, it is key to consider what end users really need. And what better way is there than to interact with them directly?</p>
  <p>One way to do so would be to establish a customer council led by an area product owner. A customer council allows an area product owner, product owner, developers, UX designers, etc. to be in constant contact with selected customers and to test a product while instantly receiving feedback from them.</p>
  <p>Betzin is part of such a customer council, comprised of 80 members from 40 different customers — most of them primary end users.</p>
  <p>There are regular Microsoft Teams calls, yearly workshops, and the typical usability tests. More importantly, there is on-site user research as well as one week of customer testing for each release. So far, this format has paid off for both parties, with customer feedback like “It’s great to see our feedback implemented” and “This software feels like it’s tailored to my needs.”</p>
  <p>Being part of a customer council is a great opportunity to see how customers work. “It requires minimal planning to do a customer visit and there are no formalities involved,” Betzin explained. According to him, this is the way to go for creating good software. Not only does it save costs, but it is also easier than developing software, delivering it to customers, and then dealing with customer incidents because something does not perform well. “Who’s going to change all the code afterwards?” he asked rhetorically.</p>
  <p>To avoid such a scenario, Betzin suggests product owners get user research done and include it in their road map. This is a key step that allows them to properly organize it, evaluate the results, work on designs, and finally validate the results, before delivering the product to the customer.</p>
  <p>Product owners being the interface between the development team and the customer will not only help ensure that the software turns out great, they will also benefit from it because they will need less capacity for development and more likely have less issues and customer incidents.</p>
  <h2 id="importance-of-user-research">Importance of User Research</h2>
  <p>Many people are not aware of what a user researcher or a visual/interaction designer can do for them and how they can benefit from conducting user research. According to Betzin, user research is important for anyone involved in software development — from product management to support. They all should have at least basic knowledge about what user research is, what it encompasses, and what kind of benefits it has.</p>
  <p>There seems to be a common misconception that software just needs to work. But when does it really work? “A developer takes care of how something should work, whereas a designer takes care of how a person works with it,” Betzin shared.</p>
  <p>To sum up, it is not enough to develop software or features just for the sake of somehow making it work. It’s important to improve people’s lives, and for that you need to listen to end users. To understand your users’ expectations, working processes, and routines, selecting the right research method is key.

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>SAP understands the login complexity that customers and partners experience while managing multiple SAP accounts and passwords. Therefore, SAP has launched <strong>SAP Universal ID</strong>, a key component of a Board-sponsored program kicked off in 2018.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Centralizing identity and user management, SAP Universal ID allows users to logon to SAP systems using <strong>one</strong> account, linking all existing SAP legacy accounts (S-/P-users).</p>
  <p>To date, SAP Universal ID supports access to more than 180 of SAP’s most popular customer and partner applications and platforms, such as <a href="https://me.sap.com/">SAP for Me</a>. In the future, additional SAP Universal ID features will complement most SAP login processes.</p>
  <p>The launch of SAP Universal ID is SAP’s commitment to significantly simplify user login experiences and by adopting SAP Universal ID, the user can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Take control:</strong> Own their personal SAP identity</li>
    <li><strong>Manage one account:</strong> In one universal account link all their existing accounts</li>
    <li><strong>Use it wherever they go:</strong> No matter where they work, their ID goes with them</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, SAP Universal ID:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is a personal and lifelong authentication for SAP portals now and in the future. Users enter <em>one</em> password and, once logged in, can choose from any of their linked accounts.</li>
    <li>Will allow SAP to deliver a compliant, sophisticated, and engaging user experience, including personalized offerings and automated communications, and to advocate for users more effectively. It will also help improve security overall due to the elimination of shared user accounts.</li>

    <div>
      <div>Last year, software designers at SAP took on an unprecedented challenge by facing <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> head on with the creation of the German <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/corona-warn-app/id1512595757">Corona-Warn-App</a>, a consumer-based application that supports contact tracing for one of the biggest health crises of the 21st century.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Facing skepticism from public media and working within a tight timeline, the SAP User Experience team built the app for the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), one of the German government’s central scientific institutions. The team learned to quickly juggle multiple expectations and requirements, drown out unnecessary noise, and focus on the “critical few” in order to create something highly usable and impactful.</p>
  <p>With six weeks from design to delivery, here are their stories.</p>
  <h2 id="constructing-a-plane-while-flying-it">Constructing a Plane While Flying It</h2>
  <p>When Emil Voutta, co-lead of the Corona-Warn-App design team, received an unexpected call over the weekend, he couldn’t have imagined what was in store for him and his team.</p>
  <p>“I heard about a startup initiative taking place and there was lots of fuss in the press. But I never thought it would end up on our desk,” Voutta said.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Describing the months of intensive design and development process that followed, as well as the rollout to the entire German population, Voutta said the experience felt akin to constructing a plane while flying it. That’s because SAP was designing a user experience on top of a brand-new API that Google and Apple were still in the process of building. Additionally, the SAP team needed to understand new processes, including how a chain of infection works, and learn how to leverage technology in new ways, such as calibrating Bluetooth for proximity detection.</p>
  <p>Juggling the different requirements from the Robert Koch Institute, the German Ministry of Health, Apple, Google, Deutsche Telekom, and the Fraunhofer Institute made it easy to feel overwhelmed. “You have to acknowledge the fact that it can just only be chaos with so many cooks in the kitchen. And then find your way in the chaos to still create something meaningful.”</p>
  <p>This meant channeling all the requirements into a design that prioritized usability above all.</p>

  <p>The initial design idea featured a simplified user experience with a very clear information architecture. It also imagined using elegant and modern illustrations along with descriptive text to facilitate onboarding and to provide users with end-to-end guidance throughout the application.</p>
  <p>With this solid concept in hand, the next step involved <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/21/testing-the-design-of-the-corona-warn-app-online-studies/">intensive user research</a>. For an app with which effectiveness depended on mass adoption and user persona consisted of nothing less than the entire range of the German population, it was critical to listen to end users very early on in the design process and work iteratively from there.</p>
  <p>The goal was to find a design that was as usable and inclusive as possible. Susann Graeff, mobile user experience designer, was deeply involved in the user research phase, moderating usability tests and collecting feedback from a wide array of users of different ages, genders, and social backgrounds.</p>
  <p>“The user research made us confident that our design was well liked and easy enough to understand,” said Graeff. “We were also able to uncover challenges and insecurities for the testers such as how to <a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/company/details/data-protection-creates-trust-for-corona-warning-app-601024">navigate the issue of data protection</a> and how to make the app more accessible.”</p>
  <p>Michael Krenkler was responsible for the illustrations ultimately featured in the app and recalls the initial feedback on the design concept: “The amazing part was seeing that the testers were excited by what they saw. We could see that the illustrations helped them understand the whole application better, created trust in regard to their data privacy concerns, and helped them to finish their tasks.”</p>
  <h2 id="constructive-approach-to-design-validation">Constructive Approach to Design Validation</h2>
  <p>Another layer in gathering feedback was working with the <a href="https://www.coronawarn.app/de/">Open Source community</a>. The design team actually published the in-progress design to the public in real time as a way to gather immediate feedback and guarantee widespread adoption.</p>
  <p>Christian Scheirmann, co-lead of the Corona-Warn-App design team, recalls the experience as being quite unnerving.</p>
  <p>“I had never been part of an experience like this,” said Scheirmann. “Typically, we only publish such results internally to the development team, not even for all of SAP, and now suddenly your work-in-progress was out and everybody got to see it and comment on it. The experience was a little bit strange in the beginning because suddenly our unfinished work was out there. On the other hand, the feedback that we got was really encouraging. It’s a truly constructive approach to validate our design.”</p>
  <p>Now that the application has been rolled out, feedback continues to pour in from all channels, and the designers are constantly gathering input from the Open Source community as they work on future iterations of the app. “I can just say thank you to the community,” Voutta said.</p>
  <h2 id="teamwork-wins-the-day">Teamwork Wins the Day</h2>
  <p>In the end it was the team dynamic that was unanimously credited for the success of the project. While the designers chalked it up to the close working relationship with the development team, developers in turn praised the solid design as the motivational boost that kept spirits up as the whole team worked day and night on the application.</p>
  <p>Teamwork meant not only collaborating well together as designers and developers, but being able to quickly incorporate feedback from product owners, accessibility experts, user assistance and communication teams, and various government stakeholders, as well as Telekom, Google, and Apple, in order to bring in all the requirements and expertise into a single app.</p>
  <p>“To be honest, it would be impossible to highlight a single aspect that I’m most proud of,” said Christian Kienle, Development Architect for Mobile. “At the end of the day, it was teamwork.”</p>
  <p>Gergana Savova, user experience designer for mobile, credits the team setup for their success: “We’ve all worked together before, and we had great trust in each other. We were able to play to each other’s strengths and start working at full speed from the get-go.”</p>
  <p>With <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/WarnApp/Archiv_Kennzahlen/WarnApp_KennzahlenTab.html">more than 25.2 million downloads</a> to date, the team is proud of what they’ve been able to achieve on a tight and critical timeline. And as they continue to fine-tune the app by expanding functionalities, their work is still far from over.</p>
