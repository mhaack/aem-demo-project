  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Hidden in the furor about disrupted supply chains is how the experience of the drivers delivering all those goods directly impacts the customer experience. That’s where <a href="https://www.wisesystems.com/">Wise Systems</a> comes in, offering an artificial intelligence (AI)-based delivery management platform that originated at the Media Lab at MIT, when three of the company’s co-founders responded to a professor’s challenge to find the best way to change one billion lives with data.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“The free flow of goods is the lifeblood of communities,” said Allison Parker, vice president of Marketing at Wise Systems. “We decided to apply machine learning to real-time data that captures what’s happening on the ground so organizations can better plan and continuously improve every last-mile route and delivery. Drivers have an intuitive, easier experience managing their schedule directly from their mobile devices, while fleet managers have up-to-the-minute plan tracking for resource allocation and utilization.”</p>

  <h2 id="data-intelligence-drives-seamless-delivery-experience">Data Intelligence Drives Seamless Delivery Experience</h2>
  <p>Fast forward to a post-pandemic world facing an 80,000 <a href="https://www.trucking.org/news-insights/ata-chief-economist-pegs-driver-shortage-historic-high">driver shortage</a> in the U.S. alone, and Wise Systems is leaving legacy “dispatch and routing” systems in the dust. Clients in the food and beverage industry, as well as courier companies, rely on Wise Systems to synthesize orders by product volume, location, and time frames into delivery stops for truck fleets and other vehicles. Fleet managers, dispatchers, and drivers can make tweaks, factoring in their knowledge, including customer preferences. The system monitors traffic and weather conditions in real time, alerting dispatchers to potential risks that could jeopardize scheduled deliveries.</p>
  <p>“Automating the routing process for the perfect, seamless experience requires intelligence up front, along with ongoing monitoring as each day unfolds,” said Parker. “Drivers appreciate having full visibility into all the data about every delivery stop, including the number of products they’re expected to deliver. All they need to do is swipe in and out when they arrive and leave. The system can also record proof of delivery. They can also leave notes for themselves or future drivers on our secure app, such as a passcode for a loading dock.”</p>
  <h2 id="machine-learning-perfectly-choreographs-route-plans">Machine Learning Perfectly Choreographs Route Plans</h2>
  <p>Contrary to misconceptions, behind the wheel is not necessarily where drivers spend the bulk of their time. It’s the on-site visits that eat up the greatest number of minutes during the course of a day. The machine learning models in Wise Systems calculate route plans based on historical and real-time data. Meantime, delivery companies can set delivery status notifications as well, allowing clients to receive updates at specified intervals.</p>
  <p>“The system can more accurately predict service times, taking into account the time it takes to complete a stop and factoring in the preferences of the retailer, hotel, medical institution, or other type of client,” said Parker. “The goal is route planning efficiency combined with customer service so people receive their inventory when and where they expect it; this is the number one priority of our clients.”</p>
  <p>From a fleet management perspective, machine learning also helps keep vehicles fully utilized to maximum capacity for both route efficiencies and more sustainable business. One global food and beverage client reduced late deliveries by 80, decreasing fleet mileage by up to 15%. On-time deliveries can contribute to a company’s carbon reduction goals as it reduces redeliveries.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Wise Systems also serves up analytics that managers and drivers find valuable. Fleet managers can immediately see everything from inventory volumes on the road and delivered, to driver times at any point in the workday. They can benchmark that data against the company’s performance metrics that typically vary depending on the type of vehicle and amount of goods. They can make fleet size adjustments to better meet vehicle utilization and sustainable business targets. Some clients have increased their fleet utilization on average by 20 percentage points. Data helps individual drivers see where they stand too, as many are compensated with performance premiums for on-time deliveries.</p>

  <p>When the Wise Systems team participated in the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> recovery cohort of <a href="https://sap.io/ny-demo-day-2021/">SAP.iO Foundry New York City</a>, they discovered new market opportunities.</p>
  <p>“We learned so much about customer needs from SAP experts,” said Parker. “Integrating information from Wise Systems with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> is a great example of how companies are using connected data between ERP systems, such as order and warehouse management, finance, and last-mile logistics operations and back, to become intelligent enterprises.”</p>

  <h2 id="modern-experience-can-help-solve-the-driver-shortage">Modern Experience Can Help Solve the Driver Shortage</h2>
  <p>Recruiting and retaining drivers for last-mile delivery is just one segment of the disrupted supply chain, but it’s a big one. Anything organizations can do to improve the quality of their day-to-day experience matters. As companies modernize the systems that power vast supply chains, don’t leave the truck driver’s experience behind.</p>

  <p>SAP’s solutions enable retailers to integrate sustainable business practices smoothly, which is critical to a fast-paced industry such as retail. According to Leslie Hand, IDC Group Vice President, IDC Retail Insights, <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fidc_emea%2F&#x26;data=04%7C01%7Cstacy.comes%40sap.com%7C32f20fbd808e403ebab108d9c18832a2%7C42f7676cf455423c82f6dc2d99791af7%7C0%7C0%7C637753612987837002%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&#x26;sdata=Avs0Ujbs1kRZqn0deU53aOOosGrbGrMddrMgbScdhSc%3D&#x26;reserved=0">IDC’s latest research</a> indicates that retail organizations report that, relative to political, social and economic risks, changing environmental targets and regulations will have the greatest impact on their digital transformation and tech investment plans in the next two years. Further, 80% (Asia Pacific) 59% (United States) and 64% (EMEA) of retail organizations agree that their digital technology strategy is an important enabler of their organization’s broader sustainability efforts.*</p>

    <div>
      <div>Clean water is one of the highest sustainability priorities worldwide, and industrial manufacturers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies to meet the challenge. In Australia, startup <a href="https://streamwisedi.com/">Streamwise D.I.</a> has developed an AI-powered intelligence platform providing industrial-grade digitization for wastewater treatment.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Manufacturers across a range of industries process water that is on the scale of megaliters per day,” said Abhyuday Bhartia, chief technology officer at Streamwise D.I. “Our devices and decision intelligence platform guide companies through collecting the right data and give them the tools to effortlessly find insights. This transparency lowers operational costs and risk while improving the organization’s ability to meet compliance regulations.”</p>
  <p>Streamwise D.I.’s blue chip customers include recognized brands in the food and beverage, mining, and chemicals industries, as well as municipal water authorities. Customers can gain business value early with smaller initial projects while making further improvements over time.</p>

  <h2 id="bubbling-up-process-inefficiencies">Bubbling Up Process Inefficiencies</h2>
  <p>The Streamwise D.I. platform collects real-time information from cameras, IoT-based sensors, and other instruments installed on machinery at the customer’s facilities. The data becomes a “digital twin” that feeds into a cloud-based dashboard, where it’s analyzed and shared as action items with designated team members. People have immediate access to the information through their mobile device or Web browser.</p>
  <p>“Within an hour of turning on the system, operations teams can quickly see water contaminant levels and if operations are out of compliance with regulations,” said Bhartia. “Over time, the algorithms calculate asset and process inefficiencies, as well as environmental compliance with that company’s municipal trade waste agreements.”</p>
  <p>Among the biggest regulatory mandates is the volume and type of chemicals that manufacturers use in wastewater treatment. The issue is as much about regulatory compliance as cost-savings.</p>
  <p>“Using the data, the operator can adjust mechanisms and treatment processes to stay in compliance and achieve great efficiencies,” said Bhartia. “With historical and real-time data, the platform can create what-if scenarios, and make automated operational control and management decisions. Companies may discover they’re using types and levels of chemicals that aren’t necessary.”</p>
  <p>One customer, an Australian cereal manufacturer, significantly lowered wastewater treatment operating costs by reducing unnecessary chemical usage. A dairy processing plant lowered trade waste charges by 26% and operator oversight by 80% for a total savings of over one-quarter of a million dollars each year.</p>
  <h2 id="data-reduces-operational-expenses">Data Reduces Operational Expenses</h2>
  <p>Addressing environment, sustainability, and corporate governance (ESG) imperatives also hinges on operational efficiencies. In monitoring and analyzing data from water treatment operations, Bhartia said that Streamwise D.I. delivers insights with far-reaching sustainable business impact.</p>
  <p>“Are operations working to their optimized efficiency? Are they working to agreed-upon specifications, or are they actually failing? Does equipment need maintenance or replacement?” he said. “Understanding and acting on all of these issues affects efficiencies for energy savings too.”</p>

  <p>Bhartia has been with Streamwise D.I. since it transitioned into a digital services platform. He agreed with the startup’s founder, Alastair Lockey, that AI had the power to modernize wastewater treatment, closing the gap between business exigencies and sustainability mandates.</p>
  <p>“Wastewater treatment systems are inefficient and extremely complex with unique environments and operations,” said Bhartia. “We knew intelligent digitalization could help simplify processes, providing operators with actionable insights to meet operational targets, budget objectives, and regulatory mandates. There’s enormous global potential to make a real difference for business and the environment worldwide.”</p>
  <h2 id="incredible-sustainability-partnership-with-sapio">Incredible Sustainability Partnership with SAP.iO</h2>
  <p>Streamwise D.I. was part of the energy and natural resource cohort of <a href="http://www.sap.io/">SAP.iO Foundry Singapore</a>. Bhartia found value in SAP’s hands-on product commercialization and go-to-market support.</p>
  <p>“It’s been an incredible opportunity working with SAP. We’ve learned so much from SAP’s experts, and their validation of our solution has provided us with greater market credibility and visibility,” he said. “Being integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/asset-intelligence-network.html">SAP Asset Intelligence Network</a> increases our collective sustainability impact for industrial water management customers globally.”</p>
  <p>Streamwise D.I. is available on <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000060292_live_v1/Streamwise%20D.I.%20Extender">SAP Store</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="tech-can-turn-back-the-water-pollution-tide">Tech Can Turn Back the Water Pollution Tide</h2>
  <p>Sustainable business demands technologies to head off increasingly dire predictions about our quality of life and very survival. The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/08/20/quality-unknown">World Bank</a> said that around 80% of the world’s wastewater is returned to the environment without adequate treatment. These experts predicted that two-thirds of the world’s population could be water stressed by 2025. But they also made it clear that “change is possible…Increased awareness, strengthened prevention, and smart investments using new technology are needed to turn back the tide of water pollution.”</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Artificial intelligence (AI) is shedding light on one of the most examined yet least understood experiences of modern life: the customer journey. From shopping malls and sports arenas, to train stations and city streets, <a href="https://www.c2ro.com/">C2RO</a> is an AI-powered video analytics platform that captures anonymized data about people’s movement so organizations can improve the customer experience.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“We analyze human behavior in physical spaces and transfer it into actionable data,” said Tim Heaney, vice president of Sales at C2RO. “With a fact-based understanding of the amount of people coming into a space, how they move through it with whom, where they linger, and what they touch and eventually purchase, organizations can manage physical environments more efficiently to improve the customer experience and business results.”</p>

  <h2 id="real-time-data-eases-commuter-experience">Real-Time Data Eases Commuter Experience</h2>
  <p>A transportation organization used data from C2RO to improve subway train and bus terminal planning.</p>
  <p>“Based on the number of people boarding and leaving trains at certain times and days, as well as which direction they’re headed at terminals, transportation managers could alleviate traffic crunches,” said Heaney. “They could reverse escalator directions to help people more easily exit or enter terminals. Aligning vehicle dispatches to actual passenger traffic flows reduced wasted trips. It also means fewer people waiting in the cold or forced to stand in crowded cars and buses.”</p>
  <p>Real-time data is particularly valuable to manage other operations such as shopping malls and entertainment venues during peak usage times like rush hour, holiday shopping, or performances. Companies can also use historical data for future planning.</p>
  <p>Heaney added that monitoring in-person occupancy levels has helped organizations meet social distancing mandates during the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="secure-anonymized-data-powers-informed-decisions">Secure, Anonymized Data Powers Informed Decisions</h2>
  <p>C2RO’s platform was designed to be fully <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> compliant. The metadata that customers receive on dashboards through a browser or mobile device is anonymized for privacy protection. Companies decide on the frequency of data updates, from real time to hourly, daily, or weekly.</p>

  </div>
  <p>There’s nothing trailblazing about counting customers – Heaney acknowledged that companies have been doing this for decades. However, C2RO provides highly accurate, granular, data-driven insights based on an organization’s KPIs.</p>
  <p>“The data shows when someone came inside the store after looking at a promotion,” said Heaney. “Did they visit the promotional display, examine the item, and visit the POS? Which entrance and exit did they use? This is valuable data to help companies quickly evaluate promotions and make adjustments if something isn’t working as expected.”</p>
  <p>Case in point was a convenience store that used C2RO to determine the relationship between high traffic displays, such as coffee, and other areas where product sales were lower. After discovering that 25% of the store’s space had no traffic at all, the management made layout changes to attract customers to overlooked areas and increase sales.</p>
  <p>“Many customers tell us that their physical spaces are a blind spot, and our data opens their eyes to the metrics of what’s going on in their space,” said Heaney. “Mall owners can quantify the number of people visiting anchor tenants and identify cross-shopping patterns in other stores. With these statistics, they can sell space at a proven premium and help tenants drive stronger sales.”</p>
  <h2 id="sapio-grows-market-opportunities-with-expertise">SAP.iO Grows Market Opportunities with Expertise</h2>
  <p>Heaney expected C2RO’s growth trajectory to continue, thanks in part to support from SAP that began during the company’s participation in the data and analytics cohort of <a href="http://www.sap.io/">SAP.iO Foundry Berlin</a>.</p>
  <p>“SAP’s brand is strong worldwide and providing us with introductions to their customers is a huge opportunity,” he said. “Our customer behavioral data is complementary to SAP solutions like <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/data-warehouse-cloud.html">SAP Data Warehouse Cloud</a>. We also valued SAP’s sales and marketing expertise, helping us with our product messaging, value proposition, and packaging.”</p>
  <p>C2RO is available on <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000059784_live_v1/C2RO%20PERCEIVE">SAP Store</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-intelligence-addresses-competitive-market-demands">AI Intelligence Addresses Competitive Market Demands</h2>
  <p>Originally founded as a cloud robotics startup, C2RO evolved to take advantage of existing video camera infrastructure worldwide. Heaney brings over 30 years of business experience to his position, having worked extensively in telecom, IT, electro-optics, and computer vision.</p>
  <p>Besides retail and transportation, he saw potential value for C2RO in industrial manufacturing for production efficiency improvements, as well as sports and entertainment venues, where fans could time food and drink breaks to avoid peak crowds at the refreshment stand.</p>
  <p>“Tough markets demand smarter, more scientific solutions to understand space management and visitor behaviors,” he said. “We’re at an inflection point where we can train intelligent algorithms much faster and have secure servers on-site while taking advantage of the cloud. AI-based intelligence is revealing the customer journey to achieve business results never imagined before.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>A call to action is changing the future of business. Regulatory committees, investors, consumers, and employees increasingly call for more socially, environmentally, and economically responsible goods and services.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The market is seeing consumers requesting sustainable products and services through their buying behavior — evidence to which we can see in the numbers. According to a STERN Center for Sustainability Business report, <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/NYU%20Stern%20CSB%20Sustainable%20Share%20Index%E2%84%A2%202019.pdf">products marketed as sustainable</a> grew more than five times faster than conventionally marketed products and three times faster than the consumer packaged goods (CPG) market. When given choice, today’s consumer is more likely to select the more environmentally responsible option.</p>
  <p>Sustainability has become a critical topic for enterprises to reduce emissions and waste, increase circularity, and use socially responsible practices throughout product life cycles. Simply put, business leaders are listening to the customers’ call to buy sustainable products and are looking to address how to make <a href="/2021/08/sustainability-journey-profitability-interconnected-nature">sustainability profitable</a>.</p>
  <p>Accenture’s CEO study confirmed that 99% of CEOs from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenues believe sustainability is <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-109/Accenture-UNGC-CEO-Study.pdf#zoom=40">important to the future success</a> of their business. When it comes to the workforce, research into workplace priorities of millennial and Generation Z employees has found they rank <a href="https://www.businessgreen.com/news/3074070/sustainability-top-priority-for-young-employees">sustainability as a leading concern</a> when evaluating the companies they choose for employment. Sustainability matters; from the products you make and how you make them to the type of talent you can attract can all hinge on your company’s sustainability model.</p>
  <p>Even federal governments are stepping in to take action. Recently an alliance of German companies that included SAP called for more tangible measures for climate protection from the federal government. The companies said in a <a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/klima-nachhaltigkeit/klimaschutz-appel-von-bayer-adidas-otto-und-co-an-neue-regierung-17579510.html">joint statement</a> that Germany must be put on a “clear, reliable, and predictable path to climate neutrality.” With governments requesting action, there is a huge opportunity to engage technologies that optimize carbon emissions, increase operational efficiency by activation of circular business processes, and connect with socially responsible partners to help organizations make better informed decisions.</p>

  <p><a href="https://sap.io/">SAP.iO</a> has the privilege of partnering with startups whose technology assists organizations as they shift their priority toward sustainability. During our work with these companies, we bring them together with SAP customers and can learn firsthand what resonates and what solutions meet the industry’s ever-changing needs.</p>
  <p>This year’s fall and winter cohorts alone support a wide variety of sustainability goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Future of Work program</strong> at SAP.iO Foundry Singapore focuses on helping customers increase the value of their workforce by developing, managing, engaging, and empowering their people to develop a skilled, healthy, and inclusive workforce.</li>
    <li>The <strong>New Mobility program</strong> at SAP.iO Foundry Munich helps customers manage connectivity in transport, fleet management, charging and battery management, and automated and autonomous driving.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Sustainability in Retail and Consumer program</strong> at SAP.iO Foundry New York helps customers in the retail, consumer products, and fashion industries drive sustainability across the value chain, including circular packaging and responsible and ethical sourcing, as well as responsible design and production.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Sustainability in Energy and Natural Resources program</strong> at SAP.iO Foundry San Francisco supports customers in the energy and natural resources industries build sustainable businesses, improve experiences, and manage their environmental footprint and sustainability goals, including compliance, regulation, tracking, and carbon trading.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Circular Economic program</strong> at SAP.iO Foundry Paris helps drive circularity for customers in service industries such as passenger and cargo travel and engineering construction and operations by helping redefine the design, production, demand, and supply of products through their use cycles for reusability, waste reduction, and new value creation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="how-customers-can-get-started">How Customers Can Get Started</h2>
  <p>Experience shows that the desire to impact sustainability goals coupled with the innovative technology needed to turn the tide must be looked at as a journey instead of a destination. Industries and companies are at different stages of maturity, with requirements in other areas across teams. The challenge is how to make sustainability profitable.</p>
  <p>To help customers get started on this journey, SAP.iO begins by initiating an innovation session to define and prioritize the critical sustainability areas. Then they leverage their experience and startup ecosystem to discover innovative solutions specifically for the customers’ business and provide the opportunity to meet with startups to learn about their solutions. Then the customer can pilot and implement startup solutions that will help achieve your sustainability ambitions.</p>

      <div>SAP’s newest employee-led venture Feather by SAP is coming to market, bringing an end-to-end recommerce solution. It will support brands and retailers that want to accelerate the shift from linear to circular business by taking ownership over their recommerce activities. It enables SAP customers to take back, manage, and resell pre-owned inventory as well as track key financial, customer, and sustainability performance indicators.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From consignment shops and other marketplaces popping up on social media pages to dedicated spaces on e-commerce websites, today’s consumers are shopping with the <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-circular-economy/">circular economy</a> in mind. The secondhand market is maturing. We anticipate that the next wave of growth is going to come from brands and retailers taking ownership over their pre-owned items and resell channels – which will drive incremental profit from secondary product ownership, attract a younger demographic at a lower customer acquisition cost, and increase frequency and loyalty and thus contribute to overall customer lifetime value while also contributing to sustainability.</p>
  <p>But, like any groundbreaking idea, the task of bringing brands into the circular economy can be easier said than done. That’s when <a href="https://sap.io/studio/">SAP.iO Venture Studio</a> comes in.</p>
  <p>Cultivating an environment for in-house innovation by investing in small, employee-led teams to build, launch, and scale products, SAP.iO Venture Studio has made solving some of enterprise’s biggest problems its mission. SAP employees are encouraged to channel their inner entrepreneur to pitch ideas for new products and solutions to the program. Following a selection process where teams work with mentors to refine their ideas, founders can develop and build their product from within the company.</p>
  <p>Feather by SAP received nearly US$3.5 million (EUR 3 million) from SAP.iO Venture Studio to tackle the challenge of bringing the circular economy to large premium apparel, fashion and luxury brands, and retailers.</p>
  <p>“Today, brands rely on partnerships with consignment marketplaces or outsource to white-label solution providers,” said Joanna Maryewska, general manager and founder of Feather by SAP. “In order to realize the full potential of recommerce and provide a great shopper experience, the ownership needs to come from in-house. We thought that as SAP, we are in a unique position to build a solution that helps brands fully tap into the opportunity of recommerce and control it on their own terms.”</p>
  <p>According to Maryewska, Feather is a cloud solution that enables businesses to pursue recommerce in-house and tap into services providers along the value chain where needed without losing control over the processes, data, and experience – a feat made possible by combining SAP’s vast experience in managing core processes for fashion, luxury, and retail with new innovative circular business processes.</p>
  <p>“That’s a winning combination for us and for our brand and retail innovation partners,” Maryewska said, adding that blending the two together can lead to transparency into the performance of recommerce and its impact on the broader business.</p>

  <p>Feather is one of the first enterprise-ready solutions that permits businesses to facilitate the in-house business processes, capture data, engage with the shopper, and own the end-to-end product life cycle – all in-house. It acts as an end-to-end managed recommerce solution with three key features: the recommerce experience (business processes), recommerce manager (tracking and reporting), and the recommerce take-back (product intake).</p>
  <p>First, the recommerce experience gives customers the ability to manage recommerce processes in-house. This includes back-end integrations and workflows required to receive, add, and track inventory, oversee product movements, then post items onto their own storefront. One checkout that shoppers already know enables a seamless experience.</p>
  <p>Secondly, recommerce manager includes analytics and performance tracking dashboards. This feature allows businesses to get a better view and understanding of operations and performance. That way, businesses can align on performance measurement and scale as needed.</p>
  <p>Lastly, recommerce take-back supports customers in taking items back from their shoppers. The feature helps create a dedicated journey for buy-back and warehouse routing. Not only that, but it can also manage store credit distribution for participating shoppers.</p>
  <p>“The vision for Feather by SAP is to provide a seamless, one-checkout experience that shoppers enjoy,” Maryewska said. “To deliver on that promise, we use intelligent features and solutions that integrate with leading commerce and returns solutions, and in doing so, we’re supercharging our customers’ commerce businesses to become more sustainable and intelligent.”</p>

      <div>Imagine getting immersed in your next corporate training program the same way you’ve binged watched your favorite Netflix series. That’s the kind of engaging employee training experience that startup <a href="https://www.hardskills.com/">Hardskills</a> has created.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Unlike traditional formats that rely on talking head lectures, Hardskills training programs are more akin to cinematic productions, featuring professional directors and actors who replicate real-world situations culturally aligned to global audiences. The objective is to serve up personalized content that builds someone’s human skills. As digital natives increasingly dominate the workforce, it turns out that skills such as being open to new ideas, critical thinking, and influencing people are prized just as much as technical know-how in the enterprise arena.</p>
  <p>“Our digital learning platform delivers the content, technology, administration, and metrics that provide personalized, interactive training for people to gain the behavioral and cognitive skills they need,” said Shoba Purushothaman, co-founder and COO at Hardskills. “With data-driven assessments, we deliver personalized coaching based on the skills graph of each employee.”</p>

  <h2 id="high-training-completion-rates-generate-roi">High Training Completion Rates Generate ROI</h2>
  <p>Hardskills’ enviable 94% enrollee completion and certification rates translate to tenfold improvements in return on investment (ROI). Customers have improved practical behavioral skills, such as communication and time management, by 63% within three months. One global tech organization achieved 97% training program completion rates among thousands of employees in 40 countries. That’s pretty impressive considering typical online learning completion rates clock in at less than five percent.</p>
  <p>“Customers find that employees can actually learn these skills quickly,” said Purushothaman. “This helps create a consistent set of operating behaviors because everyone is learning the same rules for open communication, time management, collaboration, professionalism, and more. In this way, we support the organization’s strategic growth initiatives.”</p>
  <h2 id="how-to-scale-individualized-digital-learning">How to Scale Individualized Digital Learning</h2>
  <p>The curriculum consists of learning modules covering “high performance fundamentals,” which is available on the <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000059110_live_v1/Global%20Business%20Skills%20%28GBS%29">SAP Store</a>. Employees learn a range of skills that typically do not make it into institutional classrooms. These include building the self-awareness to become more inclusive and open to ideas from people who thinking differently, or how to influence people who don’t report to you. A leadership program is under development.</p>
  <p>“We track people’s progress in every module, and reach out to offer help if someone is lagging behind,” said Purushothaman. “We’ve won over skeptics who thought learning was confined to school. People of all ages tell us they’re able to manage bigger teams, yet spend fewer hours at work. Women especially are prioritizing more by learning how to say no. That’s one of our most popular modules.”</p>

  <p>Like her two co-founders, Purushothaman channeled her expertise in media and B2B marketing technology content into Hardskills.</p>
  <p>“Our cool movie techniques and technology make the learning experience come alive,” she said. “We have fully interactive sessions with believable characters like the office underdog, bully, or annoying co-worker who takes credit for the work of others. People are drawn in to listen and learn because it’s persuasive storytelling. We contextualize modules around relatable, shared experiences such as sports and major world events.”</p>
  <p>Born and raised in Malaysia to parents of Sri Lankan origin, Purushothaman absorbed the classic migrant ethos that education was the passport to life. She’s lived in seven countries and brings a global mindset to everything she has done.</p>
  <p>“Although I never imagined I’d be living in America or building a company based out of Berlin and Singapore, where I am today is a natural combination of who I am and everything that I’ve done,” she said. “From being an outsider, I learned how to become an insider, be adaptable, and pick myself up.”</p>
  <h2 id="innovation-partnership-with-sap">Innovation Partnership with SAP</h2>
  <p>Landing in Berlin, Germany, four years ago to establish Hardskill’s European present, it was not until her company’s inclusion in the <a href="https://sap.io/startups-by-women-get-spotlight-in-sap-io-no-boundaries/">SAP.iO No Boundaries initiative Future of Work</a> cohort that Purushothaman jump-started her company’s next transformation. This cohort supported startups led by female and/or underrepresented founders.</p>
  <p>“I didn’t resemble the typical entrepreneur at the time, so this was quite transformative,” she said. “Our network expanded immediately as we forged relationships with SAP’s marketing and product experts. People took our calls, and talked with us at meetings. We changed how we thought about our product and go to market strategy, iterating POCs based on expert recommendations. We even hired great people through SAP’s network.”</p>
  <p>Today SAP is also a Hardskills customer. <a href="https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html">SAP Labs India</a> has incorporated the startup’s training modules into the company’s strategic commitment to collaborative working. In addition, Hardskills is integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/human-resources-hcm.html">SAP SuccessFactors software</a>.</p>
  <p>“Our partnership with companies like Hardskills reflects SAP’s commitment to not only nurture a startup culture in our organization, but also foster co-innovation across our vibrant ecosystem,” said Sindhu Gangadharan, senior vice president of SAP User Enablement and managing director of SAP Labs India. “Providing guidance and mentoring on using the latest SAP technologies, we’re building the next generation of innovators who are helping our customers become intelligent enterprises.”</p>
  <h2 id="online-learning-opens-career-opportunities">Online Learning Opens Career Opportunities</h2>
  <p>Since the first roll-outs of massive open online courses (<a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2013/04/30/the-democratization-of-education-can-online-education-help-business-innovate-faster/">MOOCs</a>), online learning was touted as the democratization of education. Fast forward a few years, organizations have discovered employees need personalized training that will open doors to their next career opportunity.</p>
  <p>As much as we prize technical knowledge, it’s the human skills that distinguish star performers.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Nobody understands the frustration of consumers who can’t find the products they’re looking for more than the experts at <a href="https://www.teamcore.net/en/">Teamcore</a>, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based startup with operations in Latin America and the United States. Teamcore’s cloud-based software platform uses machine learning to power intelligent workflow automation that tells consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies and retailers why products aren’t selling and what they can do about it fast.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“We help CPG companies and retailers make sure products are available when their customers are ready to buy,” said Sergio Della Maggiora, founder and CEO of Teamcore. “Whether someone is shopping online or in a physical store, our retail execution platform based on intelligent workflows helps connect data across the supply chain – from warehouse to shelf, virtually or in-store – so companies don’t miss out on sales opportunities.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="intelligent-automated-workflows-boost-cpg-sales">Intelligent Automated Workflows Boost CPG Sales</h2>
  <p>Based on sales data analytics, Della Maggiora said that Teamcore’s machine learning algorithm detects when products aren’t selling as planned and, in over 94% of cases, finds the root cause of the problem before assigning a task. Unlike garden variety alerts, Teamcore’s intelligent workflow notifications keep going until they reach the people who solve the problem. If someone in replenishment can’t find the product in the warehouse to restock virtual or in-store shelves, the workflow automatically routes that task to the appropriate store sales representatives, all the way up to regional store and supply chain managers.</p>
  <p>“Teamcore connects the whole CPG and retail team for opportunity detection sales and doesn’t stop until someone actually fixes the problem,” said Della Maggiora. “Over time, the collected data trains the model, improving its accuracy and ability to make predictions about potential issues.”</p>
  <h2 id="automated-retail-execution-leaves-no-opportunity-unturned">Automated Retail Execution Leaves No Opportunity Unturned</h2>
  <p>Teamcore tackles some of the biggest challenges retailers face. Consider the problem of phantom inventory, which happens when company systems show products at a location, but they aren’t actually there. Another issue is underperforming promotions. CPG companies can have the best intentions in giving discounts to retailers, but if the right-priced products aren’t available to customers for whatever reason, the items won’t sell. Addressing these problems is not as simple as it sounds.</p>
  <p>“Retailers deal with thousands of product-related issues happening every day in virtual and brick and mortar stores,” said Della Maggiora. “Data from our automatic workflows lets retailers see where the problems are and act faster to correct them. If the algorithm detects that a product is underperforming compared to the same promotions in other locations, sales teams can take appropriate steps, like prioritizing in-store visits, replacing missing signage, or other activities, to help the retailer take full advantage of the promotion.”</p>
  <p>Teamcore’s customers include well-known global brands in food and beverage, personal care, and other CPG sectors across Latin America and the United States. On average, these companies have increased product sales from 3% to 5% by improving on-shelf product availability from 4% to 9% and online product availability from 5% to 15%.</p>
  <p>“One major CPG company reallocated its field sales team to activities where they could impact greater sales,” said Della Maggiora. “Once our data revealed how much time reps wasted on low value store visits, the company shifted the same team to dynamic, higher-value activities that had bottom line business results.”</p>

  <p>Born in Chile, Della Maggiora initially studied business, then began exploring technology during his undergraduate work. He and his cofounders took advantage of a government grant program in Chile to start a software company that developed mobile solutions. Eventually, he applied his eight years of retail operations experience at Walmart to cofound Teamcore. After seeing huge process inefficiencies firsthand, he and his team conceptualized a mobile and desktop app based on data science. Then the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> hit.</p>
  <p>“We knew that designing a simple user experience on top of a solid data science platform would help retail operations become more efficient, selling what consumers want to purchase,” he said. “When COVID-19 disrupted supply chains, many CPG organizations shifted to e-commerce and faced customer demands in unexpected ways – everything from rising home cooking trends to spikes in uptake of particular products. Our solution helps brands better understand and adapt to these fluctuating sales cycles.”</p>
  <h2 id="sapio-hones-targeted-cpg-product-design-and-messaging">SAP.iO Hones Targeted CPG Product Design and Messaging</h2>
  <p>Della Maggiora and his team began working with experts across SAP while participating in the <a href="https://sap.io/foundry-berlin/">SAP.iO Foundry Berlin</a> data and analytics cohort. He saw alignment with SAP’s intelligent enterprise vision and expected Teamcore to deliver greater value by integrating with SAP solutions in <a href="https://www.sap.com/industries/consumer-goods-cpg.html">consumer products</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/industries/retail.html">retail</a>. Teamcore is already integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/sales.html">SAP Sales Cloud</a>.</p>
  <p>“We’ve learned so much from SAP’s consumer products and retail experts about how customers can generate value from our data when it’s integrated with their enterprise resource planning (ERP), financial, and supply chain systems,” said Della Maggiora. “These insights have helped us in product design and crafting our messages for stronger market resonance on a global scale.”</p>

  <p>The SAP.iO Foundries program was created as a strategic business unit in 2017. “We saw a need to work more closely with startups in a curated way, as startup innovation was becoming increasingly important for our customers in their digital transformation journeys,” Gorman says. “With SAP.iO Foundries, we are offering them the innovative power of pre-selected startups whose solutions can integrate seamlessly with SAP solutions. And while most of the startups are at an early stage, we do a lot of due diligence to ensure that they will be long-term, viable partners of SAP.”</p>

  <p>Gorman joined the team in 2017 and set up SAP.iO Foundry Berlin, the first of its kind in Europe. Located across 10 locations today, SAP.iO Foundries make up a global network of top-tier startup programs, including accelerators, that can enable startups to build and scale innovative software solutions that deliver value to SAP customers.</p>
  <p>Over the past four years, Gorman and her team have been working with over 330 early-stage startups to bring them into the SAP ecosystem and make them the next generation of SAP partners.</p>
  <p>“We encourage the startups to use or integrate with SAP technology and support them in doing so,” she explains. “In exchange, the startups expand their ability to scale more quickly through access to our customers and fast-track support to becoming an SAP partner. Thus, we can ensure that our customers have access to the latest and best startup innovation that increases the return on their investments in SAP.”</p>
  <p>The SAP.iO Foundries program has received numerous awards and, most recently, took the lead in GlassDollar’s corporate-startup innovation rankings.</p>
  <p>Currently, 135 startup solutions are available on SAP Store. “Every week, new startup solutions are being added to SAP Store where they become available to SAP’s sales teams and our customers,” Gorman says.</p>

      <div><strong><a href="https://sap.io/foundries/">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In her new role, Gorman, who led the SAP.iO Berlin Foundry and subsequently SAP.iO in EMEA until the end of April, will be globally responsible for the combined startup activities of SAP as well as for <a href="/2019/03/keeping-entrepreneurial-spark-alive-intrapreneurship">intrapreneurship within SAP</a>.</p>
  <p>“These two units are two sides of the same coin,” she says, “as they both work closely with entrepreneurs and the scaling of ideas or solutions – SAP.iO Foundries with external startups, the intrapreneurship team with startup ideas that originated here with SAP employees. There are actually many synergies between the two teams that we are now in the process of building out and leveraging.”</p>
  <p>The intrapreneurship team has currently just started its acceleration program with over 25 internal teams for different parts of SAP, developing their ideas to minimum viable products (MVP) in order to try to secure financing just like an external startup would do with a venture capitalist. Once a team receives an initial investment, they then move into SAP.iO Venture Studio, where they can focus on the development of their startup. “Our approach to intrapreneurship is seen as best-in-class, but we are in the process of looking at how we can take intrapreneurship to the next level.”</p>
  <p>Gorman considers scaling what they are doing today to be the major challenge in the near future. “Our unit is moving from being a ‘startup’ within SAP to ‘scale-up,’” she says. “The first few years were all about establishing our brand and curriculum. Now that we have good traction, we have to redefine the processes to be able scale our activities across more geographies.”</p>
  <h2 id="fostering-diverse-talent">Fostering Diverse Talent</h2>
  <p>Being able to combine a family and a career is a key benefit of working for SAP, according to Gorman: “Lots of companies claim to provide an environment where you can have a family <em>and</em> a career, but SAP is walking the talk – and I want young women to see the possibilities our company offers to them.”</p>
  <p>About two-thirds of Gorman’s team at SAP are women. With their offices located around the globe, team members also come from a total of 20 countries. “We like to think of ourselves as the most diverse team in the corporate world that works with startups,” she says. “In our team, we live the diversity focus that we have set for SAP.iO Foundries and deliver outstanding results.”</p>
  <p>Increasing the number of historically underrepresented founders in their programs is something SAP.iO Foundries set as a goal in 2019 with the SAP.iO No Boundaries initiative. “We’ve increased that number every year, so by now we come close to 50%,” Gorman says. “We make sure to tap into the networks where these founders are so that we are able to access the kind of innovation that is created by diverse teams, which is proven to be the most successful kind.” This focus was also given to the intrapreneurship program this year, with a lot of emphasis given to role models.</p>
  <p>Gorman’s enthusiasm for working with female and diverse founders led her to work with a number of like-minded businesswomen in Germany to create the nonprofit network <a href="https://encourage-ventures.com/">encourageventures</a>, which is dedicated to increasing diversity in the startup sphere and among investors.</p>
  <p>“There were 12 of us in the beginning and it took us six months of weekends and evenings to launch <a href="https://encourage-ventures.com/">encourageventures</a>,” she says. “We created a platform bringing female Angel investors and mentors together with female-founded companies.” In less than 90 days after the launch, over 260 startups had reached out to the network and over 300 experienced female managers and professors joined ready to open their networks, share experiences, and make investments.”</p>
  <p>To Gorman, this aspect of her work is particularly rewarding. “I strongly believe in diversity, in difference of backgrounds and opinions leading to excellent results, and I want to further encourage that. I would call this a major motivator for my work both in and outside of SAP.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>Once upon a time, we easily traded off product sustainability for reasonable prices, quality, and safety. Now we expect companies to bake sustainability into business as usual, and startups like <a href="https://simreka.com/">Simreka</a> have the technology to make it happen. Its cloud-based simulation software helps manufacturers experiment faster to create more sustainable products.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“We are accelerating the design and manufacture of products that are both cost-effective and sustainable,” said Dr. Akshay Patel, co-founder and CEO at Simreka. “Companies can quickly collect and analyze data including materials, manufacturing processes, quality and performance standards, pricing, safety and compliance, and carbon emissions to simulate design options. With these insights, leaders can make product design decisions that will best meet business targets.”</p>

  <h2 id="scaling-sustainability-with-cost-and-time-savings">Scaling Sustainability with Cost and Time-Savings</h2>
  <p>Simreka’s customers are primarily consumer packaged goods (CPGs) and chemical materials manufacturers in the United States, Europe, Middle East, and Mexico. Professionals in product research and development (R&#x26;D), supply chain, materials, quality assurance, sustainability, and manufacturing operations are relying on the software’s artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to answer critical questions like should we develop this new product, redesign an existing one, select this particular material, or take another manufacturing approach? The company also provides data from public sources to support customer decisions.</p>
  <p>“Companies may decide to manufacture the same product, but in a different way. Or, they realize it makes sense to create an entirely new product,” said Dr. Patel. “Our name comes from our simulation software and that ‘eureka moment’ our customers have when they see what’s possible and the best action. They can run a lot more experiments during a shorter timeframe, reducing time wasted, increasing their chances of success, and speeding up commercialization of products that meet cost, safety, and sustainability criteria.”</p>
  <p>One manufacturer reduced R&#x26;D experiment timeframes by over 80%, saving time and costs. Another customer was exploring alternatives to animal leather in their products. Another was experimenting to find climate-friendly options for petroleum-based plastics and other materials. One company used simulations to remove a component expected to be regulated in the future and replaced it with a safer material while maintaining the product’s quality, cost, and sustainability.</p>
  <h2 id="scalable-sustainability-worldwide">Scalable Sustainability Worldwide</h2>
  <p>Although he’s based in the Netherlands, Dr. Patel grew up and studied in India, where the company also has an office in Bangalore. Long fascinated by alternative fuels and materials, his undergraduate and graduate studies focused on biofuel alternatives and chemicals.</p>
  <p>“I wanted to turn the product ideas in my PhD thesis into a solution that could scale across the globe so that manufacturing companies can speed up sustainable product development and design from the earliest stages through production,” said Dr. Patel. “Some of this comes from my parents, who instilled in me a lifelong commitment to do something meaningful in the world.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Unlike conventional AI and machine learning bots, Dr. Patel said that Simreka’s technology generates predictions by analyzing a wide range of data from raw materials and manufacturing processes, through external market data. The startup continuously iterates algorithms with customers as they simulate product design and production scenarios.</p>
  <p>“The only way we’ll see wider production and adoption of sustainable products is if they are also affordable and just as high performing and safe as before,” he said. “We can address climate change, and it’s good for business too, saving time and resources in R&#x26;D and manufacturing.”</p>
  <h2 id="working-with-sapio-foundry">Working with SAP.iO Foundry</h2>
  <p>As an alumnus of <a href="https://sap.io/foundry-berlin/">SAP.iO Foundry Berlin</a>, Dr. Patel appreciated the access to SAP experts in <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-product-lifecycle-management/">product lifecycle management (PLM)</a>, industries, and other cloud-based solutions, including introductions to customers.</p>
  <p>“We valued SAP’s openness, especially conversations with its customers, which helped us fine tune our value proposition and gain a better understanding of how we can work together to address market needs,” he said. “We can integrate data from <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> and other SAP solutions with our simulator to help customers generate new insights so that they can create more sustainable products.”</p>
  <p>Simreka’s growth over the past 18 months reflects larger climate change trends for business everywhere.</p>
  <p>“Sustainable products used to be something separate, but now customers are telling us that it’s core to their business,” said Dr. Patel.</p>
  <p>Sustainability should not be the purview of a limited few who can afford higher priced, exclusive goods. It’s for all of us and the future of our planet.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Whether it’s your favorite pizza place that treats you to Italian flair and flavor anytime, the local bookstore with the best curated selection, or the creative agency that really understands your business, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are considered the backbone of the world economy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/smefinance">World Bank</a>, MSMEs make up roughly 90% of businesses globally — there are approximately 400 million of them — and employ 50% of the workforce.</p>
  <p>While smaller businesses tend to be more flexible and quicker to change than larger corporations, they are much more vulnerable to deterioration in the business environment. The <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic has unleashed extensive socioeconomic impacts, putting millions of companies worldwide at risk of being forced out of business.</p>
  <p>The crisis has hit MSMEs and their workers particularly hard. A significant challenge for them can be access to working capital to run and grow their business. This was already an issue for many small companies before the crisis started. The International Finance Corporation estimates that 65 million firms in developing countries have an unmet financing need of <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/Industry_EXT_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Financial+Institutions/Priorities/SME+Finance?CID=IFC_TT_IFC_EN_EXT">$5.2 trillion</a> every year — almost twice the GDP of the UK.</p>

  <h2 id="getting-access-to-cash-is-tough">Getting Access to Cash Is Tough</h2>
  <p>MSMEs in particular rely on funding from banks, since they typically do not access capital markets. Over the last decade, <a href="https://www.bis.org/review/r210302g.pdf">43%</a> of external finance for MSMEs in the euro area has come from bank loans, double the share for large firms.</p>
  <p>However, getting a loan can be difficult for MSMEs. Rejection rates have always been higher due to the costs of serving customers and higher risk profiles for banks, as well as a lack of traditional data to accurately evaluate the creditworthiness of MSMEs. This lack of information about the applying business and the limited transaction history are among the concerns and why their lending requests get turned down.</p>
  <p>How can this funding gap be bridged?</p>
  <h2 id="no-business-can-do-business-alone">No Business Can Do Business Alone</h2>
  <p>Over 5.5 million companies conduct business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce on the newly unified <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html">SAP Business Network</a>. Between buyers and suppliers, $3.75 trillion of B2B commerce activities transpire. The next phase of evolution is to integrate the physical and financial supply chains. Historically, siloed or inaccessible information from vendors and disconnected systems and teams across the organization posed challenges for companies to react to changes quickly.</p>
  <p>Leveraging <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kC67yRBjVU">SAP Supplier Financing</a> enables an open ecosystem of financial institutions to integrate and embed relevant financial solutions within the context of every business transaction executing on SAP Business Network.</p>
  <p>SAP Supplier Financing leverages the data that was traditionally locked within an SAP system to unlock new ways for banks to distribute finance to MSMEs and bridge the funding gap.</p>
  <p>Available since 2018 and started as an internal venture in the <a href="https://sap.io/">SAP.iO</a> program, SAP Supplier Financing adds capabilities to SAP Business Network with a new working capital solution for trading partners, providing millions of transacting suppliers with simplified and cost-effective access to a network of lenders to help improve cash flow. Suppliers can use this free extension as part of their existing <a href="https://www.ariba.com/ariba-network">Ariba Network</a> subscription. At the same time, their corporate buyers that are already part of SAP Business Network will not be charged with IT implementation costs, nor with additional software commitments.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Connecting a stack of applications, data, and business processes gets more complicated by the minute as today’s businesses operate in an increasingly complex IT environment. MSMEs are no different. Data is king, but with the rapidly growing number of data sources, types, and volume, creating value from data is getting tougher. Aware of these challenges, SAP Supplier Financing was built on SAP BTP from the ground up. It leverages Ariba Network data such as the supplier profile, invoice, and purchase order and turns it into real insights and business value for the suppliers by matching their financial needs with curated funding partners.</p>
  <p>With SAP BTP, suppliers can review multiple offers from funding partners without sending paper and scanned PDF documents usually required for due diligence process and funding events. Once they choose an offer and establish the relationship with the funding partner, SAP BTP automates the exchange of electronic data between the supplier and their funding partner, thereby improving the daily sales outstanding (DSO) from a few months to only a couple of days.</p>
  <p>Since its inception in the <a href="https://sap.io/studio/">SAP.iO Venture Studio</a> in 2017, SAP Supplier Financing has facilitated more than $70 million in funding to Ariba Network suppliers. During the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>, the former SAP.iO venture facilitated access to over $40 million in financing for MSMEs in the U.S., supporting a steady cash flow in times of crisis.</p>
  <h2 id="enable-financial-partners-to-get-the-full-picture">Enable Financial Partners to Get the Full Picture</h2>
  <p>Providing suppliers with access to capital via Ariba Network is one side of the coin. On the other side are financial institution partners in need of verified data to assess the financial situation of these supplier businesses. With SAP Supplier Financing on SAP BTP, financial partners get unified access to consolidated data across different trading partners along with the ability to integrate data from non-SAP data sources on a single platform for improved transparency into the financial health of the MSME. This turns raw data into real business value, allowing banks to serve smaller firms effectively and efficiently and to limit the risk of investing in a failing business.</p>
  <p>Started with the successful integration into Ariba Network, SAP Supplier Financing now aims to scale the matching solution outside of the U.S. and eventually offer it as part of SAP Fieldglass, SAP S/4HANA, SAP Commerce Cloud, and SAP Concur software.</p>

  <p>Even though using only one set of log-on credentials offers great advantages for SAP customers, it also means that if this password is compromised, the attacker may gain access to multiple SAP services and accounts at once. That’s why SAP Universal ID developers were searching for a more secure solution that prevents fraud but doesn’t impact usability.</p>
  <p>Authenticating with <a href="https://insights.sap.com/biometrics-sensing-healthy-society/">biometrics</a> has been proven to be the most secure way to protect user accounts and devices without impacting user experience and conversion rates. But until now, biometric authentication could exclusively be used in native apps on mobile devices. This recently changed with a brand-new Web standard called “WebAuthn” that makes it possible to use biometrics on Websites.</p>
  <p>But developing a biometrics-based authentication process, combining it with a secure cryptographic challenge-response two-factor authentication protocol, and integrating it into an existing tech stack takes a lot of time, knowledge, and developer resources.</p>

  <p>That’s why SAP decided to realize this project together with Hanko. The young <a href="https://www.hanko.io/">authentication-as-a-service provider</a> was invited to participate in a three-month startup accelerator program at SAP.iO Foundry Berlin in 2019. In a joint proof of concept, the SAP team tested password-less authentication with Touch ID and Windows Hello for SAP Universal ID.</p>
  <p>With their managed cloud application programming interface (API), Hanko enabled SAP developers to access a fully-fledged and certified WebAuthn infrastructure right from the beginning of the project. Hanko accompanied the SAP team, providing demo code and ready-to-use client and server software development kits. To create an optimal user experience (UX), Hanko also supported the UX team in the development and implementation of the new user flows for the password-less authentication methods.</p>
  <h2 id="the-outcome">The Outcome</h2>
  <p>The result of the proof of concept is a fully functioning SAP Universal ID test environment supporting password-less two-factor authentication with WebAuthn authenticators, such as Windows Hello, Apple Touch ID and Face ID, as well as FIDO Security Keys. Since Hanko supplied the main code components, SAP was able to integrate the password-less technologies into SAP Universal ID with a small team in just one-third of the estimated</p>
  <p>time. The test environment will be leveraged for further user testing until the feature is released to SAP customers.</p>
  <p>Thilo Brandt, IT senior manager for SAP Universal ID, confirms that internal tests have produced a consistently positive response, from developer and QA level up to top management. “The development effort for introducing password-less authentication was significantly reduced through the use of Hanko. The team helped us to successfully navigate implementing password-less authentication into our application stack and user interfaces.”</p>
  <p>Michael Braun, IT chief product owner of Identity and User Management at SAP, is happy with the outcome of the project as well: “With the help of Hanko, we were able to prove the feasibility of our vision for a password-less log-on for SAP Universal ID in terms of technical implementation as well as usability on all major operating systems such as Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.”</p>
  <p>Felix Magedanz, founder and CEO of Hanko, is pleased to see that Hanko’s authentication-as-a-service solution is so well received at SAP and that the deployability of Hanko’s API has been successfully proven. “Our project with SAP demonstrates the power and the benefits of our password-less API. Seeing our solution being used by one of the largest software companies in the world makes us proud and strongly validates our approach. Through the close cooperation and feedback from SAP developers, we were able to improve our solution to make it even more convenient for future customers.”</p>
