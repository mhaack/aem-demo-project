      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>According to a recent <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/10/92351eae-017e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP and Alpha Sense survey</a>, most businesses have not embedded sustainability into their core strategies. In some cases, corporations see sustainability management as a regulatory and compliance challenge rather than a strategic opportunity for economic and social growth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Therefore, businesses run different technologies and end up operating in silos, which prevent them from connecting financial outcomes with non-financial metrics. Additionally, companies can view sustainability as an after-the-fact reporting activity without any influence in its executive decisions.</p>
  <p>Today, more than ever, businesses need to holistically manage their business models across their supply chains, operations, and people agenda.</p>
  <p>At the recent COP26 climate conference, <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">business and government leaders agreed on the urgency</a> to reinvent their business models to accelerate sustainable business performance. Business leaders want to meet regulatory requirements, improve efficiency in their processes, and create responsible products and services.</p>
  <p>As the leading enterprise resource management company, SAP has committed to help customers in their digital transformation to make sustainability profitable and profitability sustainable.</p>
  <p>In this digital transformation, SAP’s approach is based on providing visibility and transparency to make sustainable decisions from the CEO’s office to the end user, connecting business processes to embed sustainability into all business functions — from carbon accounting to gender equality — and providing a global ecosystem of partners than can help SAP to scale impact through businesses of all sizes and across all industries around the world.</p>
  <p>Providing a global ecosystem to help businesses is core to SAP’s DNA.</p>
  <p>Julia White, chief marketing and solutions officer and member of the Executive Board at SAP SE, points out: “<a href="/">Sustainability is a team sport</a>. No company or organization can do it alone. We work with many of the world’s best companies who support our vision and work together with us every day to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers.”</p>
  <p>Working with SAP, <a href="https://www.sap.com/partner.html">partners</a> advance market development for sustainable solutions. They turn ideas and imperatives into compelling paths to action that leverage SAP solutions. Together, we advocate with thought leadership and galvanize collective efforts and methodologies in industry forums like the World Economic Forum, World Business Council on Sustainable Development, and United Nations Organizations.</p>
  <p>SAP and its ecosystem accelerate sustainable innovation as a central element of the intelligent enterprise. Through co-innovation as well as solution and content partnerships, SAP brings more complete solutions to market faster, benefiting our customers and the planet. More broadly, SAP serves as a key player in a thriving ecosystem of sustainability innovation — helping customers more easily capitalize on emerging solutions that tie closely to their digital core. With its robust network, SAP can deliver a path to sustainability innovation that no other individual competitor can match.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The typical understanding of what “design” means to many of us is the way something looks or feels — for example, the look of an iPhone, a movie poster, furniture, or everyday appliances. But what if design was a way of looking at the world with an eye toward changing it?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By adopting a fundamentally different approach in the way we create and design products, services, and solutions we can, for instance, take finite resources to design infinite, regenerative systems that can work sustainably in the long run. In doing so, we can apply circular design as a shorthand for the practice of applying <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/about/company/purpose-and-sustainability/economy.html">circular economy</a> principles at the design stage of everything and enable the way design changes and redefines our relationship with the world.</p>
  <p>Today, we face a devastating pandemic, new levels of global warming, extreme ecological degradation, and continuous setbacks in our work toward global goals for more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable development. Simply put, the state of the planet is broken, where every tenth of a degree of warming matters and those who have done the least to cause the problem are suffering the most.</p>
  <p>Making peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century. With recently concluded <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">COP26</a>, nations, along with businesses, negotiators, and citizens came together to address the burning issue of climate change.</p>
  <p>While the focus at COP26 was mostly on climate action, to ensure progress on our sustainability ambitions, we need a systemic approach that looks at the complete big picture. <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/completing-the-picture-climate-change">Research from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a> finds that our transition to renewable energy “can only address 55% of emissions. The remaining 45% comes from producing the cars, clothes, food, and other products we use every day.”</p>
  <p>In acknowledging that ambitious goals require ambitious action, <a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/g20-2021/">SAP has made its position on what governments need to do at COP26 clear</a>: to take decisive action and provide a mandate to business to drive solutions to achieve our shared global goals.</p>
  <p>As a part of our sustainability journey, we believe we can design and provide highly innovative and viable solutions that will not just repair the damage to the earth humans have caused so far, but actually prevent more harm. Eighty percent of a product’s environmental impact is baked in at the time of its design, proving that the only way we can create a successful circular economy is with a focus on how our products are designed, sourced, made, and delivered.</p>
  <p>I previously <a href="/2021/09/sap-s4hana-core-sustainable-intelligent-enterprise">discussed the sustainability portfolio in SAP S/4HANA Cloud</a> and how SAP is addressing four dimensions, including climate action, circular economy, holistic steering and reporting, and social responsibility. SAP has announced the availability of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a> — an embedded, cloud-native SAP S/4HANA solution — to help customers with the sustainable design and responsible management of materials and products so that they can accelerate their transition to a more circular economy.</p>
  <p>With SAP Responsible Design and Production, businesses can embed circularity principles into core business processes, helping to eliminate waste, circulate products and materials, and regenerate natural systems to unlock new value. The new solution gives companies better visibility into how materials flow through their processes, including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations for things like packaging and plastics.</p>
  <p>They can also keep pace with increasingly strict regulations like extended producer responsibility standards, which can put significant financial and physical responsibility on the company about how they manage the disposal of their products. These standards differ across regions and countries. For example, a shampoo brand manager has visibility into the full product life cycle, including extended producer responsibility obligations and the plastic taxes of different markets. These costs can be very expensive. This visibility helps the brand manager make design changes to eliminate waste and decisions on how to reduce the costs of re-use and recycling systems.</p>

    </picture>Technology solutions like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCUoogKpbYk">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a> are a fundamental step in enabling businesses to become intelligent, sustainable enterprises and drive global impact at scale. But business should not commit only to doing less harm, but to doing more good. Business has the power to not only reduce and reuse, but also to regenerate. We need to go from seeking to reduce our ecological footprint and “chasing zero,” to becoming net- or nature-positive, building not just a circular economy, but a regenerative economy.
  </p>
  <p>The regenerative economy implies a circular approach beyond the narrow view of products to one that includes the social, natural, and built environment. It is an approach similar to natural ecosystems that find synergies and balance. The regenerative business is intelligent, using innovative technology to gather insight and apply it to scale change. It measures impact, holistically and in real time.</p>

  <p><a href="/2021/11/sap-accenture-help-organizations-embed-sustainability">Accenture shares SAP’s vision</a> of zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality. To achieve a sustainable world, organizations must transform into intelligent enterprises, and intelligent enterprises must form a network of intelligent enterprises.</p>
  <p>In addition to the accepted top line and bottom line, a new “green line” covering the environmental, social, and governance aspects needs to be established as another dimension of success across business processes and along value chains. This way, organizations achieve transparency and influence that span beyond company borders.</p>
  <p>The recently published <a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/4795-10-31-2021">United Nations Global Compact–Accenture CEO Sustainability Study</a> shows that many global industry leaders are already demonstrating behaviors that are critical to achieving a competitive advantage from sustainability. Accenture and SAP are ready to help organizations accelerate in their journeys to become sustainable intelligent enterprises.</p>
  <p>According to Peter Lacy, chief responsibility officer and global sustainability services lead at Accenture, “With the circular economy we have an unprecedented opportunity to transform some of the challenges we face into opportunities, creating economic value and sustainability impact for business and society. In fact, our research shows the value at stake is massive: $4.5 trillion of upside, even at conservative estimates. We are proud to partner with SAP to seize the circular advantage, as we believe business can spur innovation, create new markets, and set our current global direction toward one that is more sustainable and resilient.”</p>
  <p>Just as the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, <a href="/2021/11/sap-io-foundries-north-america-accenture-sustainability-cohorts">SAP and Accenture recently welcomed two new cohorts</a> for the external startup accelerator SAP.iO Foundries North America. Thirteen startups were selected for the cohort among hundreds of applicants by a jury of SAP and Accenture experts, partners, and customers. They are building innovative solutions to drive sustainability for consumer and retail companies across the value chain in areas including reusable packaging, responsible and ethical supply chain, and emphasizing a circular economy.</p>
  <p>With the launch of SAP Responsible Design and Production, SAP aims to address two critical challenges: managing complex extended producer responsibility regulations and plastic taxes, which vary from country to country, and enabling every organization to reduce their use of plastic, thereby contributing to sustainable and profitable growth through less plastic and less exposure to regulatory costs.</p>
  <p>Because SAP Responsible Design and Production directly leverages data from core enterprise resource planning (ERP) processes, it enables determining material compositions and calculating extended producer responsibility fees across numerous product lines as well as adhering to a growing number of different extended producer responsibility declaration schemes.</p>
  <p>To date, we have four clients testing the beta version of the new solution, released at the end of August, and they will be closely involved in assessing new releases. We are co-innovating with many of the world’s largest consumer products organizations in the solution development to support long-term industry success and delivery of the zero waste ambition.</p>
  <p>To this end, our joint teams are ready to deliver. We are helping our clients to define their road maps, identify priorities, and accelerate their journeys through the selection and implementation of relevant SAP S/4HANA Cloud capabilities and new SAP solutions. Our sustainability management portfolio is enabled by a modular SAP S/4HANA Cloud, helping us to drive a positive planetary impact in a holistic manner while incrementally expanding it along further aspects, including water, energy, land use, and social dimensions.</p>
  <p>When sustainability is embedded in its DNA, building software that helps companies measure, account, and take the right action in dynamic and heterogeneous environments is the final step in managing environmental impact.</p>
  <p>As Sir David Attenborough rightly said, “If working apart we are a force powerful to destabilize our planet, surely working together we are powerful enough to save it,” before concluding, “In my lifetime I’ve witnessed a terrible decline. In yours, you could and should witness a wonderful recovery.”</p>

        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announces the availability of SAP Responsible Design and Production, a solution for designing products sustainably and transitioning to a circular economy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is the latest offering in a growing portfolio of sustainability-specific software applications that help businesses increase their measurement and data management capabilities.</p>
  <p>As sustainable business regulations, such as plastic taxes, are put in place, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production solution</a> enables brands to accelerate their transition to circular-economy business practices. The new solution helps companies gain better visibility of material flows through their processes including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations, especially those concerning product packaging and plastics. As businesses increasingly develop sustainable products, managing materials and regulatory data is becoming one of the most complex challenges across the consumer industry today.</p>
  <p>“The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design — eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature,” said Andrew Morlet, CEO, <a href="https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a>. “Digital solutions play an important role in the transition to a circular economy. They enable businesses to embed circular practices across their operations, from designing products to reduce waste from the outset, to tracking the lifecycle of the materials they use.”</p>
  <p>With SAP’s new solution, businesses can embed circularity principles into core business processes, helping eliminate waste and unlock new value by designing products to be sustainable from inception. For example, a shampoo brand manager has visibility into the full product lifecycle, including their extended producer responsibility (EPR) obligations and the plastic taxes of different markets. This visibility helps the brand manager make design changes to reduce waste and decisions on how to lower the costs of the downstream reuse and recycling systems.</p>
  <p>“Every year, we use almost twice the amount of resources than the planet can regenerate,” said Scott Russell, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and head of Customer Success, “Business can play a crucial role in keeping value in our systems for longer through smart, responsible product design that reuses resources rather than disposing of them. There is inherent complexity in designing products that eliminate waste and use responsible materials, but SAP Responsible Design and Production tackles that complexity and offers a ‘gold-standard’ solution to our customers, helping to deliver circular products and achieve a regenerative economy.”</p>
  <p>SAP Responsible Design and Production, a cloud-native solution co-developed with <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-and-sap-extend-partnership-to-help-companies-accelerate-sustainability-transformation-drive-new-sources-of-value-and-lead-in-the-circular-economy.htm">Accenture</a> on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, provides tailored intelligence that enables businesses to keep pace with EPR regulations and plastic taxes, embed circularity principles into core business processes and optimize design for sustainable business.

    <div>
      <div>As we <a href="/2021/04/sap-and-accenture-sustainability-better-business">covered previously</a>, Accenture and SAP are focused on helping companies embed sustainability in their core business, as well as collect and analyze the data they need to optimize their sustainability performance right across the value chain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With <a href="/topics/cop26">COP26</a>, as organizations gear up to take on their sustainability ambitions more seriously than ever, this collaboration becomes critical to effectively support our customers. Here, we’ll bring you up to date on progress across a number of key initiatives driven jointly by our organizations.</p>

  <h2 id="key-pillars-for-our-partnership">Key Pillars for Our Partnership</h2>
  <p>This graphic highlights the pillars where we are concentrating our efforts. In each of these areas, we are developing targeted solutions to empower companies’ sustainability performance.</p>
  <p>Crucially, all our work together aims to provide relevant support for specific industries, as companies in different sectors need to meet the needs of customers, regulators, and other stakeholders. As customers increasingly demand real progress, we are helping companies deliver on the promises they’re making.</p>
  <h2 id="un-global-compact-partnership-on-sdg-ambition">UN Global Compact Partnership on SDG Ambition</h2>
  <p>We are continuing to accelerate our collaboration with the United Nations (UN) Global Compact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Ambition. The momentum of the <a href="https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/sdg-ambition">SDG Ambition Accelerator program</a> continues to grow, with more and more companies now mobilized to accelerate both their adoption of ambitious corporate targets and integration of the 17 UN SDGs into core business management.</p>
  <p>By embedding SDG-aligned practices deep into their business operations and across their value chains, these companies can make more rapid progress toward achieving the goals of the 2030 agenda.</p>
  <p>The first round of the program successfully concluded in June, with over 600 companies across more than 65 countries participating and more than 1,200 company leaders taking part in accelerator workshops. The results were overwhelmingly positive, with 89% of participants satisfied with the program and 88% agreeing that the accelerator helped them identify new ways for their company to contribute to the SDGs. Additionally, we are about to launch a second round of the program, with an enhanced curriculum and multiple additional local tracks, including in Australia, Korea, Kenya, Argentina, and Canada. So far, more than 700 companies from over 80 countries have signed up.</p>
  <p>Accenture shares SAP’s vision of zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality. To achieve a sustainable world, organizations have to transform into intelligent enterprises, and intelligent enterprises have to form a network of intelligent enterprises.</p>
  <p>In addition to the accepted top line and bottom line, a new “green line” covering the environmental, social, and governance aspects needs to be established as another dimension of success across business processes and along value chains. This way, organizations achieve transparency and influence that span beyond even company borders.</p>
  <p>Accenture and SAP together want to help organizations to become sustainable intelligent enterprises. To enable this, SAP is developing new solutions and embedding sustainability into existing solutions along the dimensions climate action, the circular economy, and social responsibility, as well as holistic steering and reporting. Accenture is helping organizations to design and implement strategies for achieving ambitious sustainability goals by leveraging the growing portfolio of sustainability management solutions from SAP.</p>
  <h2 id="climate-action-enabling-our-customers-to-move-to-low-carbon-business-models">Climate Action: Enabling Our Customers to Move to Low-Carbon Business Models</h2>
  <p>SAP and Accenture work together to help organizations design and deliver carbon intelligence strategies that are powered by SAP solutions and technologies and address both direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We help our clients to define their decarbonization strategies and road maps. These go beyond simply achieving a target but are also intended to help sustain and monitor future ways of working. Our objective is to empower organizations to move beyond a compliance and reporting mindset, and instead harness emission-related intelligence in their businesses as a lever for growth and strategic transformation.</p>
  <p>With the SAP solutions coming out of its Climate 21 initiative, we’re helping companies to accelerate their journeys to net zero, to kick-start the decarbonization of their end-to-end processes, and to integrate carbon emissions management into their business decision-making. All this is possible through SAP Environment, Health, and Safety Management (emissions management), whih allows tracking and managing environmental footprints on a corporate level, and the recent release of <a href="/2021/09/sap-product-footprint-management-redesign-sustainability">SAP Product Footprint Management</a>, which allows calculating environmental footprints on product level at scale.</p>
  <p>In addition, numerous SAP solutions — including SAP Ariba Procurement, SAP Concur, and SAP E-Mobility — will provide additional levers in the future for reducing scope 3 emissions.</p>

  <p>We have co-developed a new solution that SAP intends to make generally available this month, SAP Responsible Design and Production. The solution aims to address two critical challenges: managing complex extended producer responsibility regulations, which vary from country to country, and enabling every organization to reduce their use of plastic, thereby contributing to sustainable and profitable growth through less plastic, fewer fines, and lower cost.</p>
  <p>Because SAP Responsible Design and Production directly leverages data from core enterprise resource planning (ERP) processes, it enables determining waste compositions and calculating EPR fees across numerous product lines as well as adhering to a growing number of different extended producer responsibility declaration schemes. To date, we have four clients testing the beta version of the new solution, released at the end of August, and they will be closely involved in assessing new releases.</p>
  <h2 id="expanding-sapio-sustainability-cohorts">Expanding SAP.iO Sustainability Cohorts</h2>
  <p>We have already seen 13 startups selected and moving ahead through the <a href="/2021/03/sapio-sustainable-future-cohort-accenture">Sustainable Future program</a> (<a href="https://sustainablefuture2021demoday.splashthat.com/">see the demo session here</a>). We continue to build on that momentum together, jointly mobilizing <a href="https://sap.io/foundries/programs/">additional cohorts</a> through SAP.iO Foundries locations in New York, San Francisco, Paris, and Singapore, where we identify, select, and mentor new startups that will bring new ideas to help solve our customers’ sustainability challenges in energy and natural resources, retail, and consumer goods.</p>
  <h2 id="enabling-better-esg-reporting-and-steering">Enabling Better ESG Reporting and Steering</h2>
  <p>Together, we are helping our customers achieve greater transparency in how they report on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. This includes addressing the data capture and integration challenge so they can successfully build an ESG capability and choosing the most appropriate reporting framework for their organization. Our objective is to help them achieve integrated reporting that captures both financial and non-financial metrics, keep up with fast-evolving regulatory demands, and create differentiated ESG value propositions for stakeholders across the various frameworks, including GRI, SASB, TCFD, and others.</p>
  <p>The World Economic Forum Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics promotes the adoption of universal and common standards and disclosures, unlocking long-term value through greater transparency, accountability, and business transformation. Based on these metrics, SAP is developing the SAP Sustainability Control Tower solution, which leverages SAP’s leading data integration, data management, and analytics solutions. SAP intends to make the solution generally available in December 2021.</p>
  <h2 id="ready-to-deliver-together">Ready to Deliver Together</h2>
  <p>Our joint teams are ready to deliver. We are helping our clients to define their road maps, identify priorities, and accelerate their journeys through the selection and implementation of relevant SAP S/4HANA capabilities and new SAP solutions.</p>
  <p>As we look ahead, we’re all focused on COP26 and the recommendations that emerge from it. To join us, <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/3d5c95bc-44d3-4c92-a775-9c5ec28ebf2d/websitePage:e228e71e-3c87-40fe-bd1a-f1a6fd7d9a52">register for the virtual session</a>s:</p>

    <div>
      <div><em>Where there’s a will, there’s a way</em>. This proverb dating back to the 1600s could not be more appropriate today as enterprises around the world grapple with the biggest business challenge of our lifetimes: creating a sustainable future.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Unsurprisingly, many companies are daunted by the seemingly insurmountable challenges, so SAP and Accenture are taking action to help them.</p>

  <h2 id="the-right-time">The Right Time</h2>
  <p>By now, we all know we must radically change the way businesses run, our impact on the environment, and the inequalities in society. That’s the only way to ensure a lifestyle that allows us to meet our current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.</p>
  <p>The signs are everywhere. Consumers are increasingly aware about the negative environmental impact of products and services, such as fast fashion, single-use plastics, food waste, and excessive packaging. They are demanding accountability and responsible business models from their favorite brands. Governments are increasing regulations around carbon emissions and waste management and are demanding manufacturers to take responsibility for their impact on the environment.</p>
  <p>Enterprises are under pressure from investors to include their environmental, societal, and governance (ESG) factors in their financial performance reports. And finally, employees are increasingly vocal about the environmental policies and actions of their employers. Businesses know they need to act, but few are rising to the challenge.</p>
  <p>A study by Accenture found while the United Nations (UN) Global Compact’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) program has challenged companies to enhance their commitment to the UN SDGs, only 25% have set goals aligned to societal or environmental needs. Although CEOs acknowledge the universal call-to-action to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, less than 50% have implemented sustainability into their operations.</p>
  <h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
  <p>As a survey of business drivers and actions to improve the environment at planetary scale conducted by SAP Insights revealed there are numerous barriers. Almost 7,500 CEOs and other business leaders from 16 industries around the globe participated in the survey. The top three reasons they cited for not moving ahead were lack of clarity on how to embed sustainability in business processes and IT systems, lack of clarity on how potential actions would align with strategy, and difficulty proving return on investment. Other factors include lack of funding, lack of expertise, or lack of support from senior management.</p>
  <p>The challenges are daunting, which is why solving sustainability issues is not something individual corporations or governments can do alone. The way ahead involves <a href="https://insights.sap.com/government-business-civil-society-fast-track-circularity/">cooperation and collaboration</a>. In this decade of delivery, partnerships are crucial.</p>

  <p>Accenture and SAP, for example, <a href="/2021/04/accenture-sap-partnership-accelerate-sustainability">have just announced they are expanding their long-term engagement</a> to help companies embed sustainability across the full spectrum of their business operations. This will help unlock new value and realize long-term growth.</p>
  <p>By combining SAP technology with Accenture’s <a href="http://www.accenture.com/sustainabilityservices">Sustainability Services</a>, the partners plan to jointly create new solutions that can empower companies to accelerate their progress on decarbonizing their supply chains and capture their share of the projected $4.5 trillion economic growth that the <a href="https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781349959679">circular economy could bring</a>.</p>
  <p>Together, Accenture and SAP will develop the new SAP Responsible Production and Design solution, which will help companies consume fewer resources and build sustainability within the design process. It will also enable companies to apply analytics to the operational, asset, and process data collected across the value chain. Such an integrated view will help them determine clear sustainability goals and metrics across business processes.</p>
  <p>As a result, companies will be able to reduce the costs of compliance and extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulation by designing and producing products with <a href="https://insights.sap.com/circularity-creates-value-from-waste/">more recycled content and less waste</a>.</p>
  <p>Accenture also supports SAP’s <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/climate21">Climate 21</a> initiative, which allows companies in any industry to use analytics to measure and minimize carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions and lower the carbon footprint across the product life cycle. Adding sustainability metrics across the supply chain provides an integrated view of environmental savings and helps optimize operations.</p>
  <p>This type of co-innovation could help solve some of the barriers cited in the SAP Insights survey. Embedding sustainability in business processes and IT systems and measuring return on investment (ROI) gives enterprises a better understanding of how to fund their sustainability efforts. With time and success companies can gain expertise, set aside funds, and engage senior leadership to support their sustainability journey.</p>
  <h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
  <p>The Accenture study identifies three things leaders anywhere in any industry can do to start implementing and scaling plans of action to address climate change, social inequalities, and resource availability.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Raise ambition and impact:</strong> Leaders must drive change in their own organizations, and through the disruption of market systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Change collaboration:</strong> Key players must connect in new ways because meaningful transformation is not a solo sport.</li>
    <li><strong>Redefine responsible leadership:</strong> Leaders must embrace their role as change agents to champion the sustainability agenda.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To learn more about the SAP and Accenture partnership for a sustainable future, join the virtual <a href="https://events.sap.com/sap-sustainability-summit/en/home">SAP Sustainability Summit</a>, taking place April 28-29. The event will focus on how companies are reducing their environmental footprints and managing limited resources productively while steering and reporting their businesses holistically.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Sustainability is the business challenge of our lifetimes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Customers are increasingly educated and demand products and services that minimize negative environmental impact. Investors are integrating climate risk in their portfolio strategies. Government regulation is on the rise around the world, affecting carbon emissions, waste management, product design, and producer responsibility. Employees are increasingly vocal about their employer’s environmental policies and actions, making it challenging for businesses to recruit top talent without a genuine environmental vision and track record.</p>
  <p>Based on Accenture research*, enterprises with high ratings for environmental and social governance (ESG) performance attained operating margins nearly four-times higher than those with low ESG ratings and generated annual total returns to shareholders that were double their peers. According <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/ungcceostudy">Accenture and United Nations (UN) Global Compact research</a>, 54% of CEOs agree sustainability is critical to the future success of their organizations, and 71% of investors believe the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> will accentuate global policies to tackle risks related to climate change.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="from-periphery-to-core">From Periphery to Core</h2>
  <p>Enterprises must show accountability through ESG performance and manage end-to-end operations responsibly. By reimagining its business model, any company can operate in an intelligent way, minimize negative environmental impact, and unleash a new dimension of enterprise resource planning (ERP). Decision-makers can use this intelligence to design better products, create engaging experiences, and equip employees to do their best work by eliminating busywork. They can create an efficient, ethical, and adaptable supply chain, reaching beyond organizations and first-tier suppliers to proactively manage performance and risks with trading partners around the world.</p>
  <p>Just like any other core business function, sustainability performance must also be managed in real time and integrated into wider business decision making. True, integrated reporting will go hand-in-hand with ESG management, and information transparency will provide a solid foundation to optimize financial results and sustainability performance together.</p>
  <p>Most companies have a long way to go before they move beyond the basics of simply reporting ESG performance to actively steering their business operations toward ambitious sustainability goals. While the UN Global Compact’s SDG Ambition program has challenged companies to enhance their commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), only <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/ungcceostudy">25% have set goals</a> aligned to societal or environmental needs. Although CEOs acknowledge the universal call-to-action to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/ungcceostudy">less than 50% have implemented sustainability</a> into their operations.</p>

    </picture>If we plan to deliver on the UN SDGs by 2030, the performance of every process and product must be measured, managed, and delivered against sustainability goals. It is an imperative that spans across the value chain – from companies’ key design decisions to product lifecycle management.
  </p>
  <p>SAP and Accenture believe that steering a company holistically – by looking not only at financials, but also at the social and green bottom lines – leads to better management decisions and more resiliency in their value chain. SAP S/4HANA helps companies to drive bottom line profitability through operational efficiency, top line growth and adaptability. It offers flexible business model innovation and transparency into its green line environmental responsibility. SAP and Accenture’s goal is to make sustainability profitable and profitability sustainable.</p>
  <p>To achieve this, enterprises must integrate sustainability into the heart of their strategy and core business systems. This is the rationale behind the collaboration between SAP and Accenture, which focuses on innovation, development, and scaling sustainability across four go-to-market sustainability initiatives:</p>
  <p><strong>SDG Ambition: Scaling Business Impact for Decade of Action</strong></p>
  <p>The first of these initiatives is our partnership with the UN Global Compact on the SDG Ambition. Announced at the World Economic Forum 2020 in Davos with 3M as Patron Sponsor, SAP and Accenture are rolling out the SDG Ambition <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/un-global-compact-in-partnership-with-accenture-and-sap-and-with-3m-as-patron-sponsor-launch-sdg-ambition-guidance-to-accelerate-business-action-to-achieve-the-sdgs.htm">Benchmarks and Guidance</a> through the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/08/2170997/0/en/New-programme-to-accelerate-business-action-on-the-Sustainable-Development-Goals-starts-with-600-companies-in-65-countries.html">UNGC Accelerator Program</a>. This includes how to implement these goals at a systemic level and how to develop new capabilities powered by SAP technologies. As of today, more than 600 companies have already signed up for the program.</p>
  <p>SAP and Accenture are working together to co-innovate and develop new SAP solutions that address sustainability and enhance existing core technologies. Both new and existing systems have a role to play in the other three joint sustainability initiatives.</p>
  <p><strong>Circular Economy: Taking Action Toward a Zero-Waste Economy</strong></p>
  <p>The power of SAP and Accenture’s partnership enables their customers to better manage material flows through their supply chains and innovate business processes to accelerate the circular economy. The initial focus is on packaging in the consumer goods and retail industries, specifically accelerating the development and delivery of the SAP Responsible Design and Production solution. Designing and promoting reusable products to address waste management is a fundamental principle of the circular economy.</p>
  <p><strong>Decarbonization: Enabling Our Customers to Contribute to a Zero-Carbon Economy</strong></p>
  <p>SAP and Accenture are working together to offer intelligent technologies that help companies – especially in natural resources, energy, and utilities – account, analyze, manage, and ultimately reduce carbon emissions. If companies cannot account for and manage total carbon emissions, they could lose their competitive edge. Solutions such as the <a href="/2020/06/decade-delivery-climate-21">Climate 21 initiative</a> and SAP Product Footprint Management help companies to embed sustainability as a new dimension of success into their analytical and transactional applications to enable ERP and intelligent enterprise to optimize their resources not only of an individual enterprise but across value chains for the entire product life cycle.</p>
  <p><strong>Startups: Collaborating with Innovators to Create a Positive Impact on Both Society and Business</strong></p>
  <p>Accenture and SAP are also tapping into their respective global innovation networks to nurture and engage startups through a <a href="https://sap.io/sustainablefuture/">sustainability focused startup program</a> to help address climate action, carbon reporting, and circular economy challenges across industries. Together, SAP and Accenture will leverage this rich source of creativity to help solve our customers’ biggest sustainability challenges.</p>
  <h2 id="helping-companies-become-twin-transformers">Helping Companies Become “Twin Transformers”</h2>
  <p>Untapped value exists at the intersection of digital technologies and sustainability, though only a few companies – referred to <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/european-double-up">as “Twin Transformers” by Accenture</a> – already link the two.</p>
  <p>From now on, twin transformation – directing innovation investment to initiatives that combine sustainability impact and the power of technology as opposed to splitting resources between advancing sustainability and technology deployment – will be critical to success. Companies that harness emerging technologies while finding new sources of value and pushing for green operations will gain a competitive advantage.</p>
  <p>Our customers provide daily proof of just how relevant our solutions are. Together, SAP and Accenture are committed to working with customers to make their sustainability ambitions a reality.</p>
  <p>We are showcasing our vision to jointly build a sustainable future at the <a href="https://events.sap.com/sap-sustainability-summit/en/home">SAP Sustainability Summit</a> on April 28 and 29. Stay tuned for updates!</p>

      <div>What do hard workers on the job site have in common with A-list celebrities? <a href="https://www.carhartt.com/">Carhartt</a>. From construction workers and farmers to firefighters and tradespeople, some of the hardest-working people on the planet rely on Carhartt. Now, perhaps surprisingly, rappers, movie stars, and models are also choosing Carhartt to make a fashion statement.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“When a celebrity wears our product, it certainly creates a buzz around the company,” said Carhartt CIO John Hill. “It raises brand awareness and exposes products that some consumers may not be aware of.”</p>
  <p>Behind the scenes, technology transformation became crucial for Carhartt to keep up with fast-paced growth. So, after more than 130 years in business and continued growth in popularity, it became imperative for U.S.-based company to transform both its apparel offerings and its business foundation.</p>
  <p>“It’s important to realize that Carhartt was as far away from a virtual company as you could be,” Hill said. “We quickly realized that not only did we need to transform our technology, but also the processes that the technology was enabling. We identified hundreds of pain points that existed across that value chain. And if we can get rid of those pain points with SAP technology, ultimately we were going to provide a better experience for our associates and our customers.”</p>
  <p>After thoroughly researching different options, Carhartt realized tapping the power of SAP’s intelligent enterprise was the best solution. Yet this hugely innovative upgrade coincided with one of the biggest challenges of our time; believe it or not, Carhartt went live during the worst of the pandemic.</p>

  <p>It was a top priority for Carhartt to remain open and provide a frictionless shopping experience for customers, ensuring there was no downtime and no negative impacts on business. “At the end of the day, the brand needs to be able to react to the demands of those customers. Ultimately the customer doesn’t care what it takes to deliver,” said Hill.</p>
  <p>With his office closed, Hill’s technology team prepared to go live while they worked from their homes.</p>
  <p>“You can’t underestimate the challenge of doing a large scale of digital transformation, while you’re growing the business at the pace we are, and still serving customers,” said Hill.</p>
  <p>Yet, he shares that bringing SAP technology online proved easy.</p>
  <p>“Frankly, the harder thing in dealing with a pandemic has been there’s no blueprint of how to plan,” Hill shared. “We were taking down our revenue on a weekly basis, and then increasing it the next week. So it was a very difficult year from that perspective. The actual technology transformation felt like a more normal course of business during the year.”</p>

  <p>Businesses across the planet share Carhartt’s forecasting challenges.</p>
  <p>“People know what they want and they want it when they want it,” said President of SAP North America DJ Paoni. “And they know how they want it. Every customer in every industry has acknowledged that <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> has put the maturing of the global economy on fast-forward. So those companies that have a more sophisticated digital technology are certainly able to pivot faster and connect with their customers on a whole new level.”</p>
  <p>Carhartt believes further investment in digital technologies is a winning strategy that will also provide a fantastic experience for customers.</p>
  <p>“So far, we implemented SAP solutions to support our retail businesses,” said Hill. “This year, we will be implementing solutions to support our wholesale and our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. I believe that the marketplace has continued to reward those customers that deliver not only a great product, but also a digitally native experience.”</p>
