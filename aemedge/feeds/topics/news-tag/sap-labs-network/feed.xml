      <div>For shoppers who’ve yearned for an immersive, personalized experience that’s open 24/7, mobile <a href="/topics/augmented-reality">augmented reality (AR)</a> technology is the real-time deal of the next era. Bangalore-based startup <a href="https://www.adloid.io/index.php">Adloid</a> is leading the charge with a platform that turns two-dimensional search and discovery into a full-fledged 3D experience, whether someone is in the market for automobiles or bikes, household furniture, consumer electronics, or personal lifestyle products.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Our AR platform gives consumers and companies personalized virtual shopping and training experiences, expanding the horizon of what AR can do for any brand or company,” said Kanav Singla, founder and CEO of Adloid. “We’re making the benefits of this technology more accessible and contextual to create an immersive experience for customers or employees on an e-commerce Website or within applications, directly from someone’s mobile device.”</p>

  <h2 id="convenient-try-before-you-buy-shopping">Convenient ‘Try Before You Buy’ Shopping</h2>
  <p>Unlike earlier AR tech that relied on clunky headsets with varied compatibility, Adloid’s AR platform runs on any smartphone, allowing customers to experience products at scale, in context. Once the online shopper logs in through their phone, the device’s camera scans their real-world surroundings and virtually mirrors the retailer’s or manufacturer’s product.</p>
  <p>“People can see how a new sofa or chair would fit into their home or apartment with a click of their smartphone,” said Singla. “Consumers can virtually try on jewelry, makeup, and other products. Remote workers can see if that laptop, screen, and desk configuration will fit in their home office. It’s as if the actual products are in front of you.”</p>
  <p>He added that manufacturers were interested in using the AR platform within training modules for industrial machinery service technicians, providing them with hands-on learning in a virtual setting.</p>
  <h2 id="immersive-product-discovery-experience">Immersive Product Discovery Experience</h2>
  <p>On the consumer side, AR technology is tailor-made for online shoppers who can’t get enough information about products they might purchase.</p>
  <p>“For someone trying to decide between different car models, AR lets them virtually go inside the trunk to see how much space is in there,” said Singla. “They can open and close the sunroof or try out the controls on the entertainment console, experiencing various car options before going to the showroom.”</p>
  <p>Automotive manufacturers are among the startup’s biggest customers, along with e-commerce platforms of all sizes, retailers with or without brick-and-mortar stores, and manufacturers located in the U.S., Germany, and India.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Some customers using Adloid have increased sales conversions from online channels up to 200%. One online retailer tripled the number of online customers who purchased consumer items after using the tool. AR also boosts customer engagement time viewing product images and videos from an average of 30 seconds to a whopping eight minutes.</p>
  <p>“Instead of being limited by a finite number of pre-posted images or videos, AR allows people to interact longer with products in a more personalized way, creating a powerful sales channel that’s always on at the customer’s convenience,” said Singla. “People can better understand how a product would fit into their lives, in many cases motivating them to make a purchase decision during that single online session.”</p>
  <h2 id="connected-data-for-intelligent-enterprise">Connected Data for Intelligent Enterprise</h2>
  <p>Adloid securely anonymizes all customer data and doesn’t store any personal images or other information once someone ends their AR session. However, organizations can extract valuable insights from the tool’s analytics.</p>
  <p>“A car might come in six colors, but which ones are customers viewing the most? Companies can see what options people are most interested in, then connect back to inventory management to make sure they can meet market demands,” said Singla.</p>
  <p>Indeed, one of Adloid’s biggest strengths is working with the SAP Startup Studio for India, <a href="https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html">SAP Labs India’s</a> startup accelerator program. Singla said that his team gained validation for product iterations, along with access to SAP solutions, including <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, and the company’s enterprise customers.</p>
  <p>“Working with a global leader like SAP gives our product immediate credibility because we learned what customers were looking for,” he said. “Adloid is integrated with <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/e-commerce-platforms.html">SAP Commerce Cloud</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp/pricing.html">SAP S/4HANA</a>, helping companies connect data to become intelligent enterprises.</p>
  <h2 id="ar-bridges-gap-between-e-commerce-and-cx">AR Bridges Gap Between E-Commerce and CX</h2>
  <p>Singla’s entrepreneurial spirit was initially sparked by his family, all of whom own businesses. He founded his first startup at age 21 during his undergraduate studies in engineering, then saw a major selling gap as e-commerce took off.</p>
  <p>“Companies went online with their catalogs, but customers couldn’t more fully experience these products,” he said. “I launched Adloid to turn e-commerce into 3D commerce where customers can try out products virtually on their mobile device. We expect AR will provide immersive experiences in more consumer and B2B online sites including fashion, travel and tourism, and large industrial machinery.”</p>

    </picture>In the role, Franc will prioritize building upon the foundation laid over the past year in California and further unite the research and development teams across the U.S.
  </p>
  <p>“I think it is about really engaging deeply with employees and understanding what drives them both inside and outside of their careers,” she says.</p>
  <p>Franc’s career at SAP began almost two decades ago on the Corporate Strategy team. After leaving to gain further experience in the tech industry in Silicon Valley, she returned to SAP in 2014, assuming leadership roles across development, design, and sales.</p>
  <p>“She brings a strong strategic perspective on the market, an operator’s mindset, and a fierce dedication to this company, its employees, and our customers,” SAP Executive BOard Members Thomas Saueressig and Juergen Mueller shared in an e-mail to the SAP development community.</p>
  <p>Most recently, Franc held the role of chief operating officer (COO) for SAP Labs in California, where she focused on motivating and connect people across different functional areas.</p>
  <p>“This role really prepared Anamarie for her new position as managing director for SAP Labs U.S.,” says Clas Neumann, head of SAP Labs Network. “All those years of experience and the different roles she held helped her become an empathic and authentic leader paired with customer centricity in everything she does.”</p>

  <p>Innovation at SAP happens everywhere, reflecting the success of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/labs.html">SAP Labs Network</a> of 20 development centers across 17 countries. However, the San Francisco Bay Area remains the densest hub of enterprise software innovation in the world and acts as a magnet for the most sought-after engineering talent. Through her experience working with enterprise technology and software as a service (SaaS) companies, Franc understands the strong influence Silicon Valley’s ecosystem of innovation has on the technology decisions made by global companies, particularly those based in the U.S.</p>
  <p>“Some of our most innovative customers are based here, adopting the latest technologies and pushing the envelope the furthest from a market perspective,” she says. “If you can win in the U.S. market, you’re primed to win in any market around the world, both as a line of business and as a company.”</p>
  <h2 id="cloud-mindset-as-basis-for-customer-centricity">Cloud Mindset as Basis for Customer-Centricity</h2>
  <p>The U.S., particularly the West Coast, is home to many of the world’s leading cloud application companies along with SAP’s major acquisitions in the cloud that maintain a presence within the region — Sybase, Ariba, SuccessFactors, Concur, Callidus Cloud, Gigya, and Qualtrics. Development teams in the Bay Area are spearheading cloud-based application development and cloud-native best practices for the SAP development community. Franc says this is expected to remain the case for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <p>Developing for customers with a cloud mindset is a clear priority for the new managing director; she is committed to ensuring the dots are connected from the end user to deep in the development organization. “To me it’s simple, but certainly not easy,” Franc says. “We need to understand our customers’ goals and what will make them successful and extend that understanding directly into every role and every function within the organization.”</p>

  <p>Franc is passionate about recruiting and developing young talents and has been instrumental in growing the <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/careers/students-graduates/graduates/next-talent.html">SAP Next Talent</a> program, an 18-month early talent rotation started on the West Coast. Under her leadership, the program tripled in size and now receives up to 12,000 applications. SAP Next Talent has developed into a high-performing, diverse, and inclusive program, with 50% women and 10% of participants from non-traditional backgrounds. At the conclusion of the program, 90% are hired as full-time employees.</p>
  <p>Achieving a truly inclusive workplace is especially important to Franc. As the daughter of a first-generation Mexican American father, she saw firsthand the obstacles he faced and was motivated by the thirst for education that he instilled in her. Franc sees her diverse background, both personally and professionally, as a strength that allows her to evaluate situations from multiple perspectives and build bridges among employees.</p>
  <h2 id="bringing-out-the-best-in-employees">Bringing Out the Best in Employees</h2>
  <p>As COO for SAP Labs in California, Franc orchestrated the launch of a new future of work pilot program that puts SAP’s new <a href="/2021/06/pledge-to-flex-future-of-work-at-sap">Pledge to Flex</a> work model into practice. The seven-week program currently underway at the Palo Alto campus draws from the collective wisdom of employees to gather feedback on hybrid working arrangements.</p>
  <p>“Bringing out the best in our 4,500 employees in ways that helps them achieve great results leads to successful teams and happy customers,” she says. Franc emphasizes the critical role played by company leaders in supporting a new balance between home and office.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Intelligent chatbots are proving that there’s no talent shortage when you know how to personalize employee recruitment. Just ask Bipul Vaibhav, founder and CEO of Skillate, a startup in India with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based talent intelligence platform.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“We help organizations quickly find the most qualified candidates, using intelligence to speed up hiring while improving the candidate experience and addressing diversity and inclusion objectives,” said Vaibhav. “Candidates appreciate having clarity on where they stand and what to expect next, reflecting well on the organization’s culture and improving its ability to attract top talent over time.”</p>
  <p>Using AI-powered algorithms, the technology automates previously time-intensive screening conversations between recruiters and candidates to significantly speed up hiring. Unlike last-generation tools, personal data is anonymized to prevent bias and candidates automatically receive updates throughout the process – whether they advance to the next screening step or not.</p>
  <p>The intelligent technology tackles the entire talent acquisition process, from job profile writing to ranking candidate applications against an organization’s job description parameters such as education, experience, and special skills. When recruiters and hiring managers receive the ranked candidates, they decide which people to move forward with for scheduled interviews. The chatbot blocks the calendars of both interviewers and candidates, automatically managing rescheduling and cancellations.</p>
  <p>Skillate’s customers span industries including IT, manufacturing, automotive, and pharmaceuticals in India, the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Organizations, on average, have reduced screening timeframes from initial job posting to scheduled candidate interviews by 60%. One customer in IT services reduced time to hire by 50% and improved the quality of candidate applications by a factor of three.</p>

  <h2 id="intelligence-saves-talent-sourcing-costs">Intelligence Saves Talent Sourcing Costs</h2>
  <p>Drawing from global, role-based skill profiles, Skillate’s algorithm can help recruiters write job descriptions that are likelier to attract the most qualified candidates. The tool also sources candidates already in the company’s database who have previously applied for other jobs. This has saved some organizations as much as 30% in sourcing costs.</p>
  <p>“We’re helping companies build a cost-effective future talent pipeline,” said Vaibhav. “They can become less dependent on expensive job boards and quickly collect a candidate’s updated information, speeding up recruitment and hiring as new positions become available.”</p>
  <h2 id="chatbot-guidance-to-make-the-candidate-shortlist">Chatbot Guidance to Make the Candidate Shortlist</h2>
  <p>Job seekers on an organization’s career site can get immediate answers to their burning questions during pre-screening exchanges. The chatbot asks candidates to upload their résumé, then provides job openings that best match that person’s qualifications. Instead of wondering and waiting for a response to their submitted application, people have greater transparency into the entire process.</p>
  <p>“The chatbot helps candidates find opportunities most suited to their qualifications,” said Vaibhav. “During screening for particular positions, the chatbot collects data from candidates in a natural conversation, asking relevant questions. People can also ask questions like whether or not they can work remotely or if travel is required.”</p>

  <p>The algorithm helps organizations address diversity and inclusion, masking personal data on résumés, as designated by the company. This could include someone’s name, e-mail address or telephone number, location, education, and other details that could reveal gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or other sensitive identifying information. What’s more, historical recruitment data reveals hiring patterns, helping track diversity and inclusion efforts.</p>
  <h2 id="growth-opportunities-from-sap-startup-studio">Growth Opportunities from SAP Startup Studio</h2>
  <p>Skillate is among the fast-growth companies that have worked with SAP Startup Studio at <a href="https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html">SAP Labs India.</a> Vaibhav acknowledged the expertise of SAP’s executives in supporting Skillate’s product design and go-to-market efforts.</p>
  <p>“We learned what enterprises were looking for based on their recruitment challenges and designed our solution so that it’s integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/human-resources-hcm.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management Suite</a>, giving recruitment teams an additional layer of intelligence,” he said. “We really appreciate the access to SAP customers, which directly supports our global growth plans.”</p>
  <p>Skillate is available on the <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000057630_live_v1/Skillate%20%7C%20AI-powered%20recruitment%20platform">SAP Store</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="personal-experience-leads-to-recruiting-innovation">Personal Experience Leads to Recruiting Innovation</h2>
  <p>Viabhav launched Skillate after struggling with recruitment for employees at an AI-based startup where he worked as a data scientist.</p>
  <p>“We weren’t attracting the right people despite receiving numerous résumés and applications,” he said. “I applied my AI expertise to the global talent recruitment challenge and came up with Skillate. It’s also aligns with my commitment to impact many people in a positive way. I wanted to create something that people love to use and businesses find valuable.”</p>
  <p>Eventually, Viabhav hopes to create a complete AI-based talent intelligence platform that includes recruitment, management, experience, and succession planning.</p>
  <p>In a post-pandemic job market, finding the most qualified candidates and hiring them as fast as possible is not a trend, but a must-have for global growth.</p>

      <div>After the earliest clinical trials in India for <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> plasma therapy went live using <a href="https://www.symetricsystems.com/">SyMetric’s</a> cloud-based analytics solution, the startup hasn’t looked back. With 10 completed COVID-19 studies behind them, SyMetric is on a mission to modernize the <a href="https://www.sap.com/industries/life-sciences.html">life sciences industry</a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“We are providing a holistic solution for clinical trials management, what we call ERP for clinical research,” said Uma Janapareddy, founder and managing director at SyMetric. “Having easily accessible data on one unified platform helps researchers develop more effective drugs with stronger study results so they can bring pioneering medicines faster to people.”</p>

  <h2 id="people-driven-clinical-trials">People-Driven Clinical Trials</h2>
  <p>Physicians, researchers, project managers, investigators, and biostatisticians are using SyMetric Trial Analytics to conduct studies at global pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations in a variety of therapeutic areas such as neurology, respiratory illness, oncology, and dermatology.</p>
  <p>Running on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, the solution captures and analyzes historical and updated clinical trial data in one system. This includes patient information indicating initial eligibility to participate in a clinical trial and progress monitoring through rigorous statistical analyses at trial completion for regulatory submission. The tool captures and analyzes electronic data from anywhere, such as a patient’s activities tracked on a mobile device or artificial intelligence (AI)-based imaging that shows medical progress.</p>
  <p>“If you’re starting a lung cancer study, you can easily find out disease prevalence rates and research histories by geography, experience of the investigators, availability of skilled coordinators or pharmacists, and other factors. Our solution brings this data together for informed planning that leads to more efficient execution,” said Janapareddy. “Once the trial is underway, our easy-to-use solutions help researchers accurately track patient recruitment, study progress, make necessary amendments to the clinical study on the fly, and conduct any other activities.”</p>
  <h2 id="time-saving-clinical-data-analytics">Time-Saving Clinical Data Analytics</h2>
  <p>According to Janapareddy, the solution gives clinicians cost-savings foresight and flexibility. Built-in algorithms automatically monitor data, for example, rejecting potential patients who don’t fit certain parameters based on gender, age, or certain health and lifestyle conditions. Real-time data saves time in data clean up at the project completion stage.</p>
  <p>Customers have reduced clinical trial setup and completion timelines by 20%. Some have saved up to 30% wastage of drug supplies during the trial manufacturing phase. One customer saved thousands of dollars using the solution to calculate the number of patient volunteers, as well as the number of drugs and testing kits required to meet randomization objectives with greater precision.</p>
  <p>“With real-time data and built-in algorithms, companies can quickly adapt protocols in response to continuous patient recruitment,” she said. “Researchers can conduct interim analyses at any time before study completion, adjusting drug dosages, delivery mechanisms, and packaging quantities. The system automatically incorporates protocol adjustments and amendments, sans any downtime and without jeopardizing overall study timelines.”</p>

  <p>While most of SyMetric’s customers are based in the United States and India, Janapareddy has set her sights on Europe, inspired by the strength of SAP’s innovation ecosystem. An alumni of SAP Startup Studio at <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/labs-india.html">SAP Labs India</a>, Janapareddy appreciated the design thinking workshops her team used to develop use cases from their collective experiences. She also valued the co-innovation relationships her startup has forged with other members of the program. These include biopharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and cosmeceutical and nutraceutical manufacturers.</p>
  <p>“We have a shared passion with SAP for the power of life sciences and integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) data on a single platform – where every company becomes an <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-enterprise.html">intelligent enterprise</a>,” said Janapareddy. “SAP is a global leader in life sciences including pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and ERP, and its leaders generously share their expertise with us. We also appreciate the significant exposure to SAP customers from this partnership.”</p>
  <p>SyMetric Trial Analytics and the SyMetric Clinical Trial Platform are available on <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/industries/try-and-buy-life-sciences-apps-and-software">SAP Store</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="connected-clinical-trial-supply-chain">Connected Clinical Trial Supply Chain</h2>
  <p>Before she founded SyMetric, Janapareddy held leadership positions at an international non-profit organization that provided funding, education, and other opportunities for underprivileged women. She developed the concept for SyMetric with input from her family and friends at SAP and in the life sciences industry.</p>
  <p>“I wanted to do something big in life, contributing to the community in a way that would have lasting impact,” she said. “There was no integrated system for clinical trials anywhere in the life science industry, so I founded SyMetric to help manage the entire supply chain for people-centric research.”</p>
  <h2 id="from-data-centric-to-patient-centric-trials">From Data-Centric to Patient-Centric Trials</h2>
  <p>Janapareddy envisioned a fully interconnected data platform for everyone involved in life sciences clinical research and manufacturing.</p>
  <p>“The industry is looking ahead to patient-centricity, where people can control their data using the latest technologies to share information and act on it on secure, compliant cloud-based platforms,” she said. “It began with informed consent and now connected data brings researchers and patients even closer together.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>In a world struggling to recover from <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-technologies.html">intelligent technologies</a> like the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming supply chain logistics and quality assurance for groundbreaking innovations. Indian-based startup <a href="https://www.tagbox.co/">Tagbox</a> has developed a cloud solution that dynamically tracks shipments on the move.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>IoT-based sensors capture the temperature and other critical parameters of products in real time, using machine learning and AI algorithms to automatically send alerts about risk anomalies so people can take corrective action and head off damages.</p>
  <p>“Our vision is to make supply chains more holistically intelligent for greater reliability and resiliency,” said Adarsh Kumar, co-founder and CEO of Tagbox. “Organizations have full visibility into shipment risks like shocks, temperature changes, tampering, or pilferage at any point along the supply chain. Our technology shares that data to the cloud, sends shipment risk alerts to relevant stakeholders, and logs data into the ERP system. People can immediately see when something’s gone wrong and take fast action.”</p>
  <p>Most Tagbox customers are located in India, but the startup is gaining traction with organizations in other parts of Asia-Pacific, including Singapore.</p>

  <h2 id="automated-triggers-for-quality-control">Automated Triggers for Quality Control</h2>
  <p>Traditional supply chain quality management was typically one dimensional and tracked shipment risk post-delivery. In contrast, Tagbox’s technology monitors products at every step of the journey with small battery-powered sensors attached to product packaging by individual SKU, box, or pallet. Hosted on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, the tool uses SAP Internet of Things (SAP IoT) and is integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/india/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP ERP</a>. Data sharing includes product or order information with designated employees in order management, transportation and logistics, quality parameters, warehouse and inventory metrics, and first to last mile delivery.</p>
  <p>For example, after downloading a mobile app, a delivery person driving a refrigerated truck transporting medication would be alerted to temperature changes in the vehicle and receive recommended actions to prevent spoilage.</p>
  <p>“People can immediately intervene when they’re notified of a temperature change or other risk, while managers can spot systemic issues and address those,” said Kumar. “Reports reveal patterns, such as where temperature excursions happen regularly. The company may decide to improve product packaging or select different transportation routes.”</p>
  <p>One pharmaceutical customer saved thousands of dollars by reducing post-delivery assessment times by up to 72 hours. Having collected real-time data throughout the shipping process, the company eliminated time-consuming reports after delivery.</p>
  <h2 id="business-growth-from-sap-partnership">Business Growth from SAP Partnership</h2>
  <p>Kumar credited his company’s recent growth partly to his team’s experience at SAP Startup Studio, an accelerator program at <a href="https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html">SAP Labs India</a> for early- and growth-stage tech startups.</p>
  <p>“Our IoT sensors collect and send data to supply chain, SAP IoT, and other SAP ERP systems that provide the business context for product shipments and locations, making this an ideal partnership,” he said. “We’ve accelerated our time-to-market because SAP experts have provided us with industry-specific opportunity guidance and introductions to a wide range of SAP customers.”</p>

  <p>While pharmaceutical companies are obvious candidates for fully traceable quality control of vaccine and other medicine cold chains, numerous industries can also benefit from real-time insights. These include food and beverage companies and consumer electronics. One e-commerce grocery company using Tagbox improved its cold chain temperature compliance while reducing missing inventory rates by 20%.</p>
  <p>“They have end-to-end traceability of real-time temperatures for products like meats and dairy products from warehouse to consumer,” said Kumar. “They can track what percentage of orders were delivered at the right temperatures, cascading to employee performance metrics and training, as well as infrastructure and other supply chain decisions.”</p>
  <p>Appliance, home electronic, and glass manufacturers have also found benefits from Tagbox when it comes to product damage prevention during transport.</p>
  <p>“Any combination of factors can damage fragile goods on the road, whether it’s bad driving and accidents or because products weren’t packaged or loaded properly,” said Kumar. “With our sensors, companies can see precisely what kind of shock happened and when it occurred. Our algorithms translate the data into meaningful metrics such as if the product was in freefall, turned upside down, tilted, or unsecured. In the moment, they can repack the item, adjust the temperature, and keep going without damage.”</p>
  <h2 id="turning-data-into-business-value">Turning Data into Business Value</h2>
  <p>Kumar, Saumitra Singh, and Sameer Singh co-founded Tagbox, drawing from 25 years of collective experience in IoT, data analytics, AI, and integrated circuit and chip design.</p>
  <p>“We realized that despite all the talk about IoT as a data generator, there wasn’t enough focus on using that data for concrete business decisions,” he said. “We wanted to tackle supply chain inefficiencies and product quality control for high-value, fragile goods traveling across cold chains. There are so many diversification opportunities in B2B operations using IoT and machine learning.”</p>
  <p>Kumar said future international expansion plans for Tagbox included the United States, providing dynamic intelligence for supply chains worldwide, long after the pandemic recedes.</p>

      <div>The <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> has been a catalyst for change, accelerating the demand for digital experiences and opening the way for new innovations across industries.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In retail, hit particularly hard in 2020, customer engagement is now largely defined by the digital experience of the consumer. As the economy reopens, consumers who remained loyal to their favorite brands throughout months of lockdowns now expect an omnichannel experience that seamlessly merges their online shopping preferences with a personalized and rewarding in-store experience.</p>
  <p>Retailers face the additional challenge of having lots of assets to manage. In a grocery store, for example, there are freezers, coolers, and HVAC systems. At the distribution center, there are those same assets plus conveyor belts, forklifts, and more. Keeping all of this equipment running smoothly is critical to ensuring products stay fresh and are delivered on time.</p>
  <p>Savvy retailers now understand that digital transformation is the key to managing a complex supply chain and providing a superior consumer experience that generates brand loyalty. Increasingly, retailers are looking to fifth generation (<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers/82400/what-is-5g">5G</a>) technology in combination with edge services as a powerful differentiator to deliver consumer experiences and leapfrog the competition to greater profitability. They are turning to SAP to help bring these 5G experiences to life with SAP’s data platform and supply chain services.</p>

  <h2 id="5g-advantages">5G Advantages</h2>
  <p>For intelligent enterprises, the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers/82400/what-is-5g">advantages of 5G</a> over the current standard 4G include greater bandwidth for faster data processing; lower latency for greater responsiveness, which produces even greater benefits when combined with edge computing; and the ability to have more devices connected to the network simultaneously, which has huge implications for IoT-enabled sensors and smart devices. The greatest benefits come from 5G’s capacity for <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GSMA-An-Introduction-to-Network-Slicing.pdf">network slicing</a>, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/5g-latency">low latency</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/edge-services.html#:~:text=SAP%20Edge%20Services%20enables%20powerful,edge%20with%20SAP%20Edge%20Services.">edge computing</a>.</p>
  <p>GSMA Intelligence, the research arm of the global trade organization for the mobile industry, forecasts that 5G will bring <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/">1.8 billion</a> connections by 2025 and a contribution of <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GSMA_MobileEconomy2020_Global.pdf">$2.2 trillion</a> to the global economy between 2024 and 2034</p>

  <p>SAP now offers a solution architecture and monetization platform that enables retailers to gain efficiencies, provide amazing consumer experiences, and unlock new revenue streams with 5G. From the supply chain to the in-store experience, SAP is helping the retail industry realize the exciting possibilities for the store of the future.</p>
  <p>“SAP is uniquely positioned to serve as the glue pulling these pieces together – from the retailer, the brand, and a fintech – and covering that last digital mile,” says Frank Wilde, vice president, Global Center of Excellence, SAP Labs in Palo Alto, who has been working with SAP customers to integrate 5G technology into their digital strategy. “That’s what we’re very excited about when we think about how is 5G coming to life.”</p>
  <p>For example, when consumers enter a shop that leverages 5G, they will see digital signage for a more personalized in-store shopping experience. When they pick up a product like a box of cereal from a store shelf, they will be able to use their 5G-enabled smartphone to have an immersive experience while learning about the ingredients and product information. After placing that product in their cart, the store’s smart shelf system will trigger a reorder notification to a distribution center and later align the product to a planogram to ensure that new stock is displayed on the shelf correctly, ultimately freeing up the shop’s staff from low value-add activities. To cap off the outing, the consumer’s mobile fintech vendor will streamline the checkout with a frictionless 5G experience.</p>
  <p>While consumers enjoy a state-of-the-art shopping experience, retailers can be confident that everything is running smoothly behind the scenes. For example, food spoilage is a vexing problem for many retailers that costs the industry billions of dollars a year. When freezers or coolers breakdown, the retailer has to remove saleable product from the store floor and arrange repairs which can take hours if not days, depending on the problem. Unless there is alternative cooling available, any food removed will be considered spoiled and must be thrown away.</p>
  <p>SAP and 5G technology provide a solution. Internet of Things (IoT) devices for monitoring equipment can check the temperature, vibration levels, and other metrics of assets to provide a 24×7 health status to <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/predictive-asset-insights.html">SAP Predictive Asset Insights</a>. If an anomaly is detected, an alert can be sent to the store operations manager in advance of the cooler breaking down. This early notification provides the time needed to either fix or replace the aging unit, saving thousands of dollars of lost food while keeping customers satisfied.</p>
  <p>Any of these experiences also can be monetized as a service with the use of <a href="https://blog.sap-press.com/what-is-sap-brim">SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/convergent-mediation.html">SAP Convergent Mediation by DigitalRoute</a>, generating additional income for retailers and brands. SAP customers can explore the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> offering and digital transformation as a service as a means to take control of their digital journey with the right technologies for their business.</p>

  <p>Code Unnati is among SAP’s global <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/sustainability-csr.html">corporate social responsibility (CSR)</a> programs, in this case, supporting India’s digital readiness commitment. SAP Labs India works with partners in government as well as the non-profit and private sectors, including customers and education, to bridge the immense digital divide between people in the country’s urban and rural communities. In addition to a digital-rich learning curriculum, the program offers students the opportunity for internships and employment at SAP.</p>
  <p>“We have the incredible opportunity to help transform India from a developing to a developed economy,” said Sindhu Gangadharan, senior vice president and managing director of SAP Labs India. “We’re driving significant engagements to support the digital-first mindset that’s reflected across numerous government initiatives. Code Unnati builds digital literacy among youth and equips them with employable skills for workforce readiness, particularly beyond large, metropolitan areas.”</p>
  <p>A total of over 6,000 youth have participated in the vocational curriculum, which includes learning future IT skills, such as data science and analytics, and next-gen technologies like <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-machine-learning/">machine learning</a>. Most importantly, an average of over 40% of program graduates obtain jobs after program completion.</p>
  <h2 id="responsible-inclusive-use-of-technology">Responsible, Inclusive Use of Technology</h2>
  <p>Code Unnati reflects just about every one of the Indian government’s “digital readiness for the next billion” commitment, notably talent development, amped up investments in research and development, innovations for both India and the world, and inclusiveness. <a href="https://nasscom.in/">The National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM)</a> is among the groups leading this initiative, working with the government and companies like SAP.</p>
  <p>“We want to leverage technology as best as possible to solve some of India’s biggest challenges,” said Debjani Ghosh, president of NASSCOM. “As we bring technology into pretty much everything we do, it can become an equalizer, as long as we start at the design stage to make sure that it’s truly inclusive across sectors, regardless of rural or urban, gender, culture, or religion.”</p>

  <p>Although India is digitally transforming like the rest of the world, the magnitude of its revolution is much bigger in scale and scope compared to many other regions. Ghosh said that talent development is among the government’s highest priorities, helping to build the population’s digital skills through public-private sector partnerships that provide training and education, mentoring, and internships.</p>
  <p>“Whether you call it a challenge or an opportunity, India has an amazing diversity of socioeconomic levels, cultures, religions, and languages,” she said. “We’re committed to partnering with the government and companies like SAP to build and foster ecosystems that use accelerators, mentorships, hackathons, and other opportunities to drive the IT charter for India.”</p>
  <h2 id="community-wide-purpose-plus-business-profit">Community-Wide Purpose Plus Business Profit</h2>
  <p>More than anything, Code Unnati reflects a commitment to purposeful business that positively impacts people’s lives.</p>
  <p>“It’s not just about bringing technology into pretty much everything we do to make things easier and personalized, but also that we build and use the technology responsibly,” said Ghosh.</p>
  <p>Democratizing technology education is also central to SAP’s purpose-driven mission, helping organizations become intelligent enterprises using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-technologies.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>. Spearheading Code Unnati with funds and resources from customers, partners, and its own employees, SAP is also at the forefront of India’s mission to provide disadvantaged students with digital skills for their future, as well as India’s.</p>
  <p>“We’ve been able to quickly scale and achieve meaningful business outcomes with partners focusing on purpose plus profit,” said Gangadharan. “We’re helping everyone lift up society for the sustainable change that’s much needed in India.”</p>
  <p>In this context, Naganur’s singular educational experience is a shining example of the tremendous opportunities in store for India’s next billion people with digital empowerment.</p>

    <div>
      <div>The push for electric vehicles (EVs) may have shifted into overdrive, but it is going to take a serious overhaul of the entire transportation ecosystem to build a profitable and sustainable e-mobility business model.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Having sufficient charging stations is just the tip of the iceberg. The transportation network is facing a major reboot, forcing automobile original equipment manufacturer (OEMs), utilities, corporations, regulators, and retailers to collaborate for innovation as never before.</p>

  <h2 id="networks-power-e-mobility-innovation">Networks Power E-Mobility Innovation</h2>
  <p>Compared to gas-powered cars, EVs and the services around them are far more interconnected. This demands a new kind of collaboration across the e-mobility value chain from corporate fleets, regulators, and smart cities to service providers and consumers.</p>
  <p>“The e-mobility network consists of multiple players from different industries and sectors with intertwined supply chains,” said Ulrich Scholl, vice president of E-Mobility at SAP. “To operate with flexibility and cost-efficiency they need to collaborate across stable, cloud-based <a href="https://www.sap.com/industries/industry-cloud.html">industry networks</a> that foster sustainable innovation around standardized processes, including invoicing and billing, as well as overall e-mobility management among partners.”</p>
  <h2 id="evs-spark-new-business-models">EVs Spark New Business Models</h2>
  <p>As sustainability mandates and promises grow, one central question is how to make EV battery recharging as easy and convenient as refilling a gas tank. Utilities are drawn to bi-directional charging that simultaneously recharges EVs while adding the battery’s stored energy back into the electrical power grid. This turns drivers into energy producers and cars into mobile power storage. Retailers are starting to monetize their solar panel energy, offering consumers free car charging while they shop, increasing customer loyalty. Meantime, corporate fleet managers are taking action by increasing EV and charging infrastructure investments that support company sustainability commitments.</p>
  <p>For example, Hanno Klausmeier, managing director of SAP Labs France, received a <a href="https://www.automobile-entreprise.com/CONNECT-fleet-Awards-derniers,9679">Fleet Manager of the Year</a> award for leading the electrification of the company’s fleet of cars for hundreds of employees located across three sites.</p>
  <p>Converting to EVs has been a seven-year journey at SAP, grounded in the company’s global commitment to sustainability, as well as the initial battery limitations of early EVs. After eliminating gas-fueled vehicles as a choice for employees several years ago, over 90% of the cars in the company’s fleet in SAP Labs France are now EVs. Convenient access to charging stations along with new fleet management operations were critical to the successful roll-out.</p>
  <p>“We knew that employees would need more stations to charge their cars so we installed super-fast charging stations conveniently located across our facilities,” Klausmeier said. “We revamped fleet management to make sure we could supervise and optimize charging stations for uninterrupted operations. Connecting the e-mobility ecosystem on one transparent platform is the only way for organizations to keep pace with the rapidly-changing industry.”</p>
  <p>Indeed, SAP Labs France developed new software to remotely manage the status of its charging stations, installing it on-site and at employee’s homes. Now available publicly, the solution helps corporate car fleet operations manage relationships with fleet management service companies, OEMs, and other suppliers that are involved with charging stations. Managers have real-time visibility into e-fleet charging station status and can quickly solve problems remotely for an easier experience.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Entirely new competitors are emerging with EVs, including “roaming” providers, which help consumers locate reliable charging stations and pay for the electricity as validated users. This is likely a temporary stop gap because it is unnecessarily complex and more costly for drivers.</p>
  <p>“We need to shorten the e-mobility value chain for cost efficiencies to charge point operators and an improved experience for customers,” said Scholl. “There’s no need to have another layer between energy providers and customers. With an open mobility platform, the whole ecosystem has the ability to build relationships for service convenience and affordable innovation, especially incorporating the use of renewable energy that’s produced locally and stored in EVs.”</p>
  <h2 id="transforming-the-transportation-sector">Transforming the Transportation Sector</h2>
  <p>Just like the iPhone disrupted the cellphone industry, e-mobility redefines the purpose of a vehicle. Already some manufacturers tout EVs as self-powered RVs. Even bigger are the implications for large-scale innovations, such as vehicles that are able to provide uninterrupted power for tools at remote construction sites.</p>
  <p>Similarly, transformations could be in store for energy retailers if OEMs bypass them to become energy providers themselves. On the corporate side, shared EVs could be part of an organization’s mobility budget for employees to spend as they see fit.</p>
  <p>EVs’ star is rising as sustainability nears the top of many consumer, corporate, and government priority lists. Over 80% of automobile manufacturers have committed to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/auto-us-2020">electrifying</a> their lineup in the near future, and some plan to go all electric within the decade. Modernizing the transportation industry means rethinking mobility as concept to make sure EVs pay off on the sustainable promise.</p>
