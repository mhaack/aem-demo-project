        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that Capstone Mining Corp., a Vancouver, Canada-based copper and metals mining company, has selected the RISE with SAP offering as part of a company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) consolidation initiative.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Capstone is committed to responsible mining practices, including its approach to sustainability, which embraces technological innovations. Through the implementation of RISE with SAP, Capstone aims to modernize its IT infrastructure and lower costs. The company plans to implement SAP S/4HANA Cloud on Microsoft Azure, moving from SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC) by the end of 2021. Capstone selected RISE with SAP not only for consolidation but also for improved flexibility and ability to scale.</p>
  <p>Capstone’s CFO, Raman Randhawa, said, “As commodity prices soar, we need to keep our operations competitive to maximize our output and opportunities. Consolidating our IT platforms and moving to a more secure, low-cost cloud option will allow us to modernize and streamline our business.”</p>
  <p>Capstone chose to implement RISE with SAP, SAP’s business transformation as a service, to leverage the success it enjoyed with its legacy SAP software that was active at its Pinto Valley mine. The implementation will help to smooth the transition of SAP services across its other mining operations and will provide Capstone with a unified view of its overall business operations.</p>

  <p>Revlon, which last year saw e-commerce net sales soar approximately 40%, remains focused on enhancing its end-to-end digital capabilities to support continued acceleration in this channel. By tapping RISE with SAP on an AWS infrastructure, Revlon expects to bolster its <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2021-06-75752-hd-cx-retail/index.html">digital infrastructure in order to help its e-commerce operations</a> become more nimble and innovative. Revlon also plans to use the SAP Analytics Cloud solution to incorporate predictive analytics across its business processes.</p>
  <p>“RISE with SAP provides Revlon with numerous opportunities to support our continued digital acceleration through modernizing our core back-office infrastructure and applications while reducing our total cost of ownership,” said Revlon Chief Information Officer Jose Urquijo. “Additionally, RISE with SAP will enable increased flexibility and agility in support of our Revlon Global Growth Accelerator program, which we announced with our Q1 2021 earnings.”</p>
  <p>“Revlon is an iconic and trusted brand that has long been known for innovation in the beauty and personal care industry, always with a keen focus on the customer experience,” said SAP North America President DJ Paoni. “We are honored to be a part of Revlon’s incredible transformation journey and provide solutions to help the company continue to scale and grow share of market.”</p>

SAP has been recognized as a Leader based on its “ability to execute” and “completeness of vision” after evaluation of 13 vendors.</p>
      </div>

  </div>
  <p>According to Gartner, “Multiexperience development platforms provide software engineering leaders and teams with a unified way to create rich, interconnected user experiences across web, mobile, conversational, digital twin, IoT and AR applications. This research evaluates 13 MXDPs based on ten critical capabilities and five use cases.”</p>
  <p>“In a world that is more connected than ever, customers expect a harmonized digital experience across all of their applications to stay innovative and competitive,” said Juergen Mueller, chief technology officer and member of the Executive Board, SAP. “SAP Extension Suite is part of SAP Business Technology Platform and delivers consistent, personalized and unified experiences across multisensory touch points and modalities. Customers such as CLAAS benefit from accelerated time to value, increased engagement and productivity, and greater business resilience.”</p>

      <div><strong><em>DUBAI</em></strong> — Expo 2020 Dubai has implemented SAP Ariba solutions to provide a real-time, unified, digital procurement and payment platform for its more than 25,000 local and global suppliers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview">SAP Ariba solutions</a> fully digitalize and automate the procure-to-pay lifecycle to streamline the process and help provide transparency and efficiency across the event organizer’s global supply chain. The cloud-based procurement solutions run on SAP’s UAE public cloud data center and connect to <a href="https://www.ariba.com/ariba-network">Ariba Network</a> where buyers and suppliers connect and transact.</p>
  <p>Through this collaborative and mobile-friendly platform, registered suppliers can receive tender invitations, negotiate and sign contracts, and submit invoices and track payments in real time. Expo 2020 Dubai has already transacted more than AED 1 billion on the platform, highlighting its commitment to driving long-term business growth in the region, with a particular focus on small and midsize enterprises (SMEs).</p>
  <p>“Expo 2020 is a long-term investment in the future that aims to enhance opportunities for sustainable business connectivity and growth in domestic and international economies,” Expo 2020 Dubai Chief Technology Officer Mohammed AlHashmi said. “Our work with SAP is an example of what can be achieved with the invaluable support of our technology partners to host one of the most digitally advanced World Expos ever. The implementation of SAP Ariba solutions has transformed our end-to-end procure-to-pay cycle and helped set new standards of procurement automation for projects of this scale.”</p>
  <p>Expo 2020 Dubai runs from October 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022, and is the first World Expo and the second mega-event to secure a Procurement Excellence Award from the Chartered Institute of Procurement &#x26; Supply.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that refrigeration and air conditioning technology manufacturer BITZER has implemented the <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/procurement/guided-buying">SAP Ariba Buying solution with guided buying capability</a> to help streamline and digitalize its procurement operations.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With the SAP Ariba solution, BITZER, based in Sindelfingen, Germany, aims to drive a more efficient, paperless, transparent process from sourcing to payment as it executes on its global expansion plans.</p>
  <p>“To overcome challenges and thrive in today’s business environment, visibility, resiliency and agility in our procurement operations are critical,” said Christian Stenzel, BITZER director of organization and IT. “Until now, our employees have procured indirect materials through manual processes. By standardizing on a digitalized procurement process, we are increasing efficiency and transparency across our operation to deliver value for our business.”</p>
  <p>The company has implemented SAP Ariba solutions to help centralize its procurement operations on a single cloud-based platform, and with help from consulting firm apsolut GmbH, it can continue its digital transformation journey.</p>
  <p>For BITZER, SAP Ariba solutions, integrated with SAP S/4HANA, help to drive a more efficient procurement process and tighter collaboration with suppliers. The guided buying capability in the SAP Ariba solution will help BITZER reduce maverick spending, provide an intuitive purchasing experience and drive more consistent compliance with purchasing policies such as budget limits, minimum bids and preferred suppliers.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that Arapahoe County, part of the Denver metropolitan area, has completed its migration to SAP S/4HANA on time and under budget, cementing it as a technology leader in the public sector.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Arapahoe County’s move to SAP S/4HANA shows how state and local government agencies can quickly seize emerging technologies and digital capabilities to transform internal operations for the benefit of the citizens they serve,” said Brian Roach, SAP North America senior vice president and managing director of Regulated Industries.</p>
  <p>The initiative is part of the 5-year strategic plan Arapahoe County developed to increase visibility into budget and spend trends, improve budget forecasting and reduce time to prepare reports and process expenses, as well as enhance user experience within the systems that support the county’s financial, HR and payroll processes.</p>
  <p>“We owe it to the citizens to manage county funds responsibly and operate as efficiently as possible,” Arapahoe County Finance Director Todd Weaver said. “Getting to the new platform will enhance our ability to do that.”</p>
  <p>The migration to SAP S/4HANA is intended to enable Colorado’s third-largest county to continue to operate efficiently and effectively, fulfilling the needs of its citizens, employee, and stakeholders while positioning the county to make further improvements in analytics, grants and funds management, budget processes, back-office process automation and user self-service going forward.</p>
  <p>“Going to SAP S/4HANA was motivated by many factors including demand for financial analytics and forecasting tools, the upcoming end-of-standard-support that would increase our maintenance costs, and a timeline of other projects that would require the same resources planned in the coming years,” said Jon Rajewich, Arapahoe County SAP business operations manager. “With SAP S/4HANA, we have a platform we can leverage to make improvements to business processes and immediately take advantage of the new features available with SAP S/4HANA.”</p>
  <p>Arapahoe County migrated its entire financial history to allow for trending and reporting over almost 20 years of financial activity. Moving from a legacy system to SAP S/4HANA allows the county to offer employees and decision-makers greater access to operational and analytical reports as well as a better user experience navigating and leveraging historical data.</p>
  <p>ABeam Consulting and cbs Corporate Business Solutions designed an innovative and affordable approach to overcome budget and technical challenges, while bringing in many new benefits of SAP S/4HANA. This includes using selective data transition for flexible data migration with minimal disruption to operations.</p>
  <p>The county also implemented self-service procurement functions from SAP, integrated business partner customer and vendor systems, and brought in embedded analytics with simple-to-use report development. These reporting enhancements equip the county government with real-time data on budget forecasting, long-term budget analysis, spending analysis and budget-to-actual analysis.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that hundreds of companies across the globe, including Toyota Material Handling U.S.A., in the first quarter chose <a href="http://www.ariba.com/?campaigncode=CRM-IS20-PRL-OOCWA01">SAP Ariba</a> and <a href="https://www.fieldglass.com/?campaigncode=CRM-IS20-PRL-OOCWF02">SAP Fieldglass</a> solutions to digitalize procurement and external workforce management.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hundreds more renewed licenses for SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass solutions and went live with the solutions to accelerate spend management optimization. Key highlights from the quarter include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Grupo Empresarial Colombina</strong>, one of the leading Colombian food conglomerates with more than 90 years of operations, selected SAP Ariba solutions for digital procurement. The company aims to standardize and automate its end-to-end source-to-pay processes to help enhance visibility into its spend, increase efficiencies and compliance, and better align its spend management strategies with corporate goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Expo 2020 Dubai</strong>, a six-month World Expo set to begin in October 2021, digitalized its procurement operations with SAP Ariba solutions to help gain visibility into its spend, tighten collaboration with over 25,000 global suppliers and achieve process automation, including completely paperless invoicing. Already, in just two months, the Expo brought some $1.4 billion in spend under management on Ariba Network.</li>
    <li><strong>Grupo Ageas Portugal</strong>, a leading insurance company, rolled out SAP Ariba solutions for sourcing, buying, contracts, commerce automation and supplier lifecycle performance. The company modernized its procurement processes and looks forward to increasing efficiency and spend transparency, improving cost controls and savings, and enhancing compliance and competitive advantage. In setting up a world-class procurement function, Grupo Ageas Portugal will improve the experience for staff and suppliers.</li>
    <li><strong>Unisys</strong>, a global IT services company, implemented SAP Fieldglass solutions to help modernize its external workforce management program. The U.S.-based company now has a solution with strong localization capabilities, self-service configurability and flexible API support. By standardizing and automating its end-to-end contingent worker processes, Unisys expects to increase visibility into this important workforce segment and improve overall efficiency.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>“The pressure on companies to strengthen alignment between corporate goals and what they spend money on and who they do business with is only increasing,” said John Wookey, president, Intelligent Spend and Business Network, SAP. “That challenge is elevating our commitment to helping customers navigate their journeys to intelligent spend management in a networked economy so they can be agile in the face of disruption.”</p>

  <p>With the implementation of SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, FC Bayern has moved from spreadsheets and manual processes to a fully integrated platform. This allows for consistent and digital HR processes and will unify data across recruiting, onboarding and performance management in the future. In addition, reports can be generated easily and efficiently for optimized workforce planning and analytics.</p>
  <p>“The SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central solution enables FC Bayern’s HR team to do what it does best — focus on strategic, value-added HR rather than transactional processes,” FC Bayern Executive Vice Chairman Jan-Christian Dreesen said. “Before implementing the solution, we worked with legacy, time-consuming processes. The integration has enabled us not only to digitalize our processes but also to innovate and redesign them. By creating a more efficient environment, our HR team can prioritize on delivering the best employee experience possible.”</p>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central includes self-service options to help increase employee engagement at FC Bayern. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/oth/sapsuccessfactors-mobile-app/index.html">SAP SuccessFactors Mobile</a> app provides all employees — including players, coaches, managers and office employees — with a modern, intuitive mobile experience. They can access their personal data and update their employee profiles as well as enter, approve and record absences such as vacations — all tasks that previously required them to reach out to HR for approval.</p>

        <p><strong><em>ABU DHABI</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that <a href="https://www.ariba.com/resources/library/library-pages/al-dahra-testimonial#video">SAP Ariba solutions</a> have helped Middle East agribusiness Al Dahra save 10% to 15% in procurement, while helping the region avoid a potential food shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The Middle East and North Africa region is among the world’s largest food importers, according to a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/07/14/middle-east-food-security-amid-the-covid-19-pandemic/">recent report</a> by the Brookings Institution.</p>
  <p>Over the past two years, Al Dahra has doubled its workforce from 2,500 to more than 5,000 employees and now operates in 15 countries across four continents. As part of its digital transformation road map, Al Dahra digitalized its end-to-end procurement processes with SAP Ariba solutions, increasing cost savings, better managing categories, and enhancing compliance and transparency.</p>
  <p>“Al Dahra’s massive global growth meant we needed to build on our economies of scale and enable our local teams to engage with global buyers to drive procurement process improvement,” said H.E. Khadim Al-Darei, Al Dahra vice-chairman and co-founder. “Despite the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> era disrupting the global agribusiness supply chain, our digital transformation with SAP Ariba solutions has enabled us to mitigate risks, maintain food security and drive agribusiness innovation. SAP Ariba solutions are the cornerstone of our future Procurement Center of Excellence, one of the key strategic initiatives for 2021 and beyond.”</p>
  <p>With access to <a href="https://www.ariba.com/ariba-network">Ariba Network</a>, which connects millions of companies around the world, Al Dahra can tap into new suppliers and host competitive e-auctions, requests for quotations (RFQs) and requests for proposals (RFPs).</p>
  <p>“Al Dahra’s digital transformation is streamlining its source-to-pay process, helping the company discover new sources of supply and strengthen its relationships with existing preferred suppliers,” said Carlos Mercuriali, senior vice president and general manager of SAP Intelligent Spend Management, EMEA South. “As a result, Al Dahra has achieved cost savings, increased its spend under management and delivered value to shareholders — and more important, kept communities fed.”</p>
  <p>Digitalization has helped Al Dahra ensure proper governance for sourcing and procurement, maintain a seamless payment process and manage recurring purchase items through catalogues. Moving forward, the company is exploring further solutions for invoicing, supplier management and performance, and analytics from SAP.</p>

  <p>With proven solutions that increase efficiency, control, compliance and cost savings, SAP is helping many of the world’s most well-known brands transform and reinvent spend management to help shape and realize business goals.</p>
  <p>During the fourth quarter of 2020, companies across the globe continued to roll out new solutions and accelerate their digital transformation journeys. These include the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DeLaval</strong>, a Swedish leader in dairy farming equipment, implemented the <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/procurement/sap-ariba-buying">SAP Ariba Buying</a> solution with <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/procurement/guided-buying">guided buying</a> capability to help streamline its purchasing process across the organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Home Shopping Europe GmbH (HSE</strong>) is a leading omnichannel retailer in Europe with three TV channels (HSE, HSE Extra and HSE Trend) reaching around 45 million households in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

    <li><strong>Swiss Federal Railways (SBB),</strong> the national railway company of Switzerland, went live with the first phase of its implementation of SAP Ariba solutions for strategic sourcing as outlined in its digitalization strategy necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging standard integration between SAP Ariba solutions and its SAP ERP solution will help SBB achieve its strategic vision for a standardized, harmonized procurement process with over 15,000 suppliers and more than 5,000 contracts under management.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, hundreds of companies chose SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass solutions in the fourth quarter, including <strong>Chevron, Duratex, Esselunga S.p.a.</strong>, <strong>General Motors LLC</strong>, <strong>Gilead Sciences Inc., Nestlé S.A.</strong>, <strong>Nomad Foods Limited, Sony Picture Networks India</strong> and <strong>Wieland-Werke AG.</strong> Others selecting these SAP solutions in the fourth quarter include the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>B3 S.A. – Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão</strong>, the largest stock exchange in Latin America, continues to evolve and transform with SAP as its long-time technology partner.

    <li><strong>Webasto SE,</strong> one of the world’s top 100 automotive suppliers, selected SAP Ariba solutions to replace its existing procurement systems with an integrated platform that provides comprehensive source-to-pay capabilities across all spend categories. The German company aims to drive higher process efficiency, cross-functional collaboration and cost savings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>“Increasingly, companies rely on procurement to help drive their businesses forward, foster resilience and make their investments count,” said John Wookey, president, SAP Intelligent Spend Management and Business Network. “Procurement leaders know the only way to get visibility and insight into every spend decision is to leverage the power of the cloud and unify spend management processes on a single platform. Our team is relentlessly focused on helping our customers achieve spend management excellence that drives cost savings and innovation while fueling deeper collaboration with trading partners — and that ultimately advances their financial, operational, environmental and social goals.”</p>
