On the same note, trust is crucial when it comes to an organization’s security on every platform it operates.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Data privacy, risk management, and cybersecurity remain key priorities for businesses in 2023 to ensure continuous high performance and to catapult to new heights. In a recent <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/306384/state-of-the-cio-2022-focus-turns-to-it-fundamentals.html">CIO Magazine survey</a>, 43% of survey respondents said that they plan to upgrade IT and data security to reduce corporate risks. That includes security and data protection measures to keep their data safe. This becomes even more important when moving to and operating in a cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) environment to drive continuous innovation. In the same CIO survey, 12% of the respondents said that they are planning to accelerate the move to the cloud as a service.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To secure data and operations in a hybrid work environment, companies have been adopting a zero trust approach. <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-definition-of-modern-zero-trust/">Forrester</a> defines zero trust as an “information security model that denies access to applications and data by default. Threat prevention is achieved by only granting access to networks and workloads utilizing policy, informed by continuous, contextual, risk-based verification across users and their associated devices.”</p>
  <p>According to 2022 global survey data published by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228254/zero-trust-it-model-adoption/">Statista</a>, 39% of companies have already begun to roll out a zero trust solution and 41% of companies have plans to adopt a zero trust strategy and are in the early phases of doing so.</p>
  <p>My principle in life is to trust people and systems until I am provided a reason not to. The zero trust principle is the exact opposite of this.</p>
  <p>The zero trust approach has three key principles: all entities and users are untrusted by default until authorized, the least privilege access is enforced, and extensive security monitoring is in place. In short, no connections to corporate networks and systems should be trusted at sight. All users, devices, and systems need to be authenticated, reverified, and continuously monitored when accessing networks, systems, and data.</p>
  <p>Adopting this approach to cloud transformation has become the leading industry standard to keep operations and data safe across the entire virtual and physical network infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Here are some best practices for putting an enterprise security plan in place that utilizes zero trust concepts to run operations safely and securely in the cloud.</p>
  <div class="promo">

        <h3 id="organizations-around-the-world-trust-sap-with-their-data">Organizations around the world trust SAP with their data</h3>

    </div>
  </div>
  <h3 id="define-clear-security-roles-and-responsibilities">Define Clear Security Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>First and foremost, ensuring security is always a shared responsibility between companies and their cloud transformation partners. It is a common goal and commitment that is independent of the type of cloud path companies take.</p>
  <p>Like with any shared responsibility, the best way to approach it is by defining the roles and responsibilities up front. This process starts by asking these key questions: who is managing the cloud, how will everyone work together to secure the cloud, who is responsible for which part, and where are dependencies?</p>
  <p>This will ensure that there is a clear strategy and plan to monitor and implement security policies and measures.</p>
  <h3 id="keep-an-eye-on-users-devices-network-applications-and-monitoring">Keep an Eye on Users, Devices, Network, Applications, and Monitoring</h3>
  <p>Based on our experience at SAP Enterprise Cloud Services, another best practice is to focus the zero trust security approach on five pillars: users, devices, networks, applications, and monitoring.</p>
  <p>Eighty-seven percent of organizations consider the <strong>application</strong> layer as being the front door for data breaches. Most data breaches through cyberattacks happen because <strong>users</strong> fail to keep their credentials safe or fall prey to false identities. In addition, the number of remote users with their own <strong>devices</strong> has significantly increased in enterprise <strong>networks</strong> as well as the number of cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary.</p>
  <p>By regulating and <strong>monitoring</strong> user access to devices, networks, and applications, companies can protect all their resources, including assets, services, workflows, and network accounts. For example, identity management systems can manage privileged user authentication and access at a very granular level. This includes keeping administrative accounts separate from corporate accounts and applying encryption to several layers in the IT environment. Data classification makes it possible to associate the security levels with specific types of data, regardless of where that data resides – in the cloud, at endpoints, or in owned data centers.</p>
  <h2 id="scaling-security-needs-faster-with-the-cloud">Scaling Security Needs Faster with the Cloud</h2>
  <p>While managing the complexity of security needs for cloud transformations can be daunting, here is an added merit: companies can scale their security needs much faster in the cloud, according to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/insight/articles/how-to-accelerate-cloud-adoption-with-security-by-design.html">Deloitte</a> research. Benefits include better automation capabilities as well as higher storage and data capacity in the cloud. Companies can push infrastructure as code and fix a security problem in real time when operating in the cloud. Automation also helps in increasing the maturity of identity management and security management systems. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/insight/articles/how-to-accelerate-cloud-adoption-with-security-by-design.html">Deloitte</a> recommends embracing cybersecurity as a differentiator to promote greater stakeholder trust and better use of cloud-native solutions that take advantage of the cloud’s full potential.</p>
  <p>In other words, you can shine like a diamond on your cloud platform of choice with a zero trust security approach for the cloud.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Data protection and privacy have always been important, but the desire to execute has become more crucial as sensitive data is digitized and shared online.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Data is the new oil,” according to <a href="https://blog.s4rb.com/data-is-the-oil-of-the-21st-century">Clive Humby</a> in 2006. In 2017, <a href="https://weeve.medium.com/data-is-the-currency-of-the-digital-age-aa7ed6552060">Jim Barbaresso</a> said, “Data is the currency of the digital age.” The world has recognized the value of data in how people do business in the 21st century.</p>
  <p>More than 400,000 companies are using SAP to run their business where often their most important data is processed.</p>
  <p>Last year was one of <a href="/topics/data-privacy">privacy</a> compliance, where many organizations were fined enormous amounts due to lack of data privacy processes and governance. This led to data protection and privacy regulations being constantly updated to suit the ever-changing threat landscape and required controls. Therefore, it is expected that these updates be implemented in 2022 and beyond.</p>
  <p>SAP has been working on innovative options to protect its customers’ “crown jewel” — not just from external threats but those closest to it, such as employees, business partners, and other users who have privileges to access sensitive information.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelleevans1/2018/03/12/why-data-is-the-most-important-currency-used-in-commerce-today/?sh=2032473054eb">As the new currency</a>, data is worth a significant amount when stolen and sold on the black market or abused for money or any malicious intent. Industries and governments have therefore put in place regulatory and legal compliance requirements to help ensure that such sensitive information is not misused to cost companies their business or economies worldwide. The growing concerns and possible repercussions for neglecting to safeguard such data can lead to incidents where recovery is difficult.</p>
  <p>A best practice for companies to proactively address data protection is to help employees avoid inadvertent data breaches. SAP addresses this with <strong>UI data protection masking</strong> and <strong>UI data protection logging</strong> packages developed by the Customer Innovation &#x26; Maintenance organization at SAP.</p>
  <p>“With the increase in remote workers, companies are challenged with securing sensitive data while allowing employees to access information and execute business processes seamlessly,” said Thomas Ruhl, head of Product Management for Customer Innovation &#x26; Maintenance at SAP. “This is only one example of the growing data protection needs of our customers. That’s why we created the new UI data protection masking and UI data protection logging software, which enables them to safeguard their data using dynamic rules that can address complex business scenarios.”</p>

  <p>UI data protection masking and UI data protection logging empower businesses to have control over which data, if deemed sensitive, should remain visible for a user to fulfill his or her job. It keeps an audit trail of user access and analyses it, helping eliminate the need to micromanage.</p>
  <p>UI data protection masking and UI data protection logging target insider threats — be they intentional or unintentional. Rules can be set to obfuscate or reveal specific data to users according to nominated authorization levels.</p>
  <p>The process of masking happens on the server side but only at the user interface layer and does not impact the application or data base layers. Masking is commonly used in concealing data such as personally identifiable information (PII), HR, financials, intellectual property, customer information, trade secrets, and anything that can be subject to harmful intent or mistake, thereby putting the business at significant risk.</p>
  <p>UI logging is the ability to gather audit logs, allowing tracking and tracing of the journey of the data, including users who accessed them. It is synonymous to leaving a fingerprint at every turn. This is ideal for audit and investigative processes.</p>
  <p>UI masking and UI logging also help address regulatory compliance requirements such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It may be EU-centric, but the regulation affects anyone or any entity outside of the EU who accesses, processes, or stores data of EU natural persons. More and more geographies are enacting similar legislation, often based on a similar direction as GDPR, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Taking steps to be compliant will incur the least effort and cost as opposed to being fined for a significant amount. <a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-fines-so-far/">According to GDPR.eu</a>, GDPR fines totaled US$63 million in its first year.</p>
  <p>A use case that is becoming increasingly popular is data access by employees from separate entities, such as demergers, sharing the same application instance. This is when attribute-based authorization is relevant and less cumbersome without the need to modify the application nor provide an additional instance.</p>
  <p>Here are questions that can help identify whether UI data protection masking and UI data protection logging are relevant to your business:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does your organization use SAP?</li>
    <li>Is sensitive information such as PII, trade secrets, IP, and business plans processed in SAP?</li>
    <li>Is the sensitive information valuable enough to be protected?</li>
    <li>Are there any data protection and privacy compliance requirements?</li>
    <li>Is your organization’s business in the process of merging/demerging?</li>
    <li>Do you find the static role-based authorization model insufficient?</li>
    <li>Would a dynamic approach that offered better granularity be more appropriate?</li>
    <li>Do you require a facility to investigate, spot data breaches, and ascertain who is responsible?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the answer is yes to point one and to any of the following questions thereafter, then SAP would suggest:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discovering what UI data protection masking and UI data protection logging for SAP can do from the <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/ui-data-protection">UI Data Protection topic area on the SAP Community</a>.</li>
    <li>Contacting your SAP account manager to arrange an initial discovery call with the product team or SAP experts.</li>
    <li>Planning the next steps together with the SAP team, such as solution value for your business case, solution demo, and more.</li>

    <div>
      <div>Almost every day, we see yet another case of ransomware. While historically, companies of all sizes are targeted, recently it appears that all the news revolves around debilitating attacks on mission-critical or business-critical systems of large enterprises — from fuel and energy companies to food processing companies.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It’s not that these enterprises haven’t taken steps to protect these assets; it’s just that the “traditional” way of preparing for and responding to ransomware simply won’t work anymore.</p>
  <p>So what’s needed to protect your organization’s business-critical applications from the looming threat of ransomware? That’s exactly what SAP and Onapsis seek to address here.</p>
  <p>When most people think about ransomware, there are two immediate, “traditional” solutions that come to mind: backups and endpoint security. Both are critical components of a solid security program, without a doubt. However, their presence could lull organizations into a false sense of security, as there still remain gaps, especially related to business-critical systems that are connected in more ways than ever before.</p>
  <p>The challenge is that many enterprises realize too late that, in preparation for a ransomware attack, you need to close all the doors and windows of your house — not just the front door of endpoint protection. When thinking about ransomware attack vectors, it’s imperative to consider all potential entry points into the business-critical environment and how to secure them. To continue this metaphor, this also includes evaluating your neighbors and how they get into your house too.</p>
  <p>When you think about all of these vectors, you slowly realize that this challenge goes way beyond just endpoint security and backups. It requires a more holistic look at securing your business-critical applications, including — yes — things that we would classify as “good security hygiene.”</p>
  <p>In a recent <a href="https://onapsis.com/active-cyberattacks-mission-critical-sap-applications">joint Onapsis and SAP threat intelligence report</a>, we demonstrated that threat actors clearly have the means, the motivation, and the expertise to identify and exploit unprotected mission-critical applications, and are, in fact, actively doing so.</p>
  <p>As an example, a massive, publicly traded company was recently subjected to a ransomware attack on its enterprise resource planning (ERP) application data. Did they have backups? Yes: the backup was refreshed once a week. However, operations halted anyway. When this happens, even with backups in place, it could still take hours or even days to restore from a backup, and the negative impact on the business and the financial losses are high regardless. Did they have endpoint security? Yes; however, the attackers bypassed the endpoint detection and response (EDR) software by accessing the data through the application. EDR is great for identifying activities on compromised assets and allowing the containment and collection of artifacts, such as process trees, files created by malware, but the application level still poses a challenge. And these attackers used that application layer, which was not monitored by the tool itself, to compromise the business-critical assets.</p>
  <p>Vulnerabilities such as 10KBLAZE, PayDay, and RECON allow threat actors to take full control of applications through the application layer itself. These threat actors go straight to the application, and, once in, go down to the operating system level there. When you consider CIO digital transformation initiatives or the rapid adjustment to remote work due to the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic, there is a significant magnification of risk. Onapsis has observed that new, unprotected SAP applications provisioned in IaaS environments were discovered by threat actors and attacked in less than three hours, with more than 400 successful exploitations observed as of the date of this publication.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, what’s needed then is a new model to defend against ransomware, one that goes beyond the scope of just protecting endpoints, backing up files, and hoping for the best. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/3993171">Gartner</a> claims that organizations should “[i]mplement a risk-based vulnerability management process that includes threat intelligence. Ransomware often relies on unpatched systems to allow lateral movement. This should be a continuous process. The risk associated with vulnerabilities changes as these vulnerabilities are exploited by attackers.” We couldn’t agree more.</p>
  <p>What’s needed is a renewed commitment to some key security fundamentals:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Security Hardening of Business-Critical Applications</li>
    <li>Timely Patch Management</li>
    <li>Point-in-Time Vulnerability Assessments</li>
    <li>Continuous Monitoring of Vulnerabilities and Threats to Your Business-Critical Applications</li>
    <li>Securing Your Custom Code in Business-Critical Applications</li>
    <li>A Commitment to Control and Governance</li>
  </ol>
  <p>SAP is committed to continuously innovating our software to keep your information safe — both on premise and in the cloud. We prioritize security so that you can stay focused on running your business and managing your customer relationships effectively using SAP solutions, safe in the knowledge that your data is secured. To protect clients from ransomware attacks, securing development infrastructure, such as the build and deploy chain, is of utmost importance to prevent the manipulation of shipment artifacts.</p>

  <p>As part of our commitment to clients, SAP follows a secure software development and operations lifecycle to identify and mitigate all kinds of security weaknesses and vulnerabilities during the development of products and services. Through the use of risk identification techniques such as the SAP threat modeling method and secure development trainings, SAP enables development teams to eliminate potential entry points for ransomware and other kind of attacks. It also ensures that basic security principles, such as that of least privilege, are part of the DNA of SAP developers.</p>
  <p>SAP continues to harden our systems with automated static code analysis, vulnerability scans, and validation from a dedicated, independent SAP internal security team. SAP’s software development lifecycle serves as an example to clients on how to support a DevSecOps model covering development and operations aspects for continuous and secure delivery of software.</p>
  <p>When deploying and running SAP applications, it is imperative that organizations focus on hardening their system to minimize the overall attack surface — for example, ensuring the proper setting of system parameters and other aspects of system configuration, including the activation of security features and functionalities. It is important that the proper configuration settings are in place to protect an organization against possible security vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p>SAP provides key features such as the SAP EarlyWatch Alert service, which monitors the essential administrative areas of SAP components to keep organizations up to date on performance and stability as well as the SAP Security Optimization service, which verifies and improves the security by identifying potential security issues related to your SAP solution and providing key recommendations.</p>
  <p>As threat actors continue to devise new modes of attack and vulnerabilities to these attacks are identified, SAP continuously provides security updates for existing code to keep your systems secure. SAP delivers these security updates through support packages, and, on the second Tuesday of every month, as part of “Security Patch Day,” SAP publishes security notes with the latest security corrections and recommendations. As noted, implementing a security maintenance process to assess and implement recommended security updates is a proven best practice for mitigating risk.</p>
  <p>Onapsis has focused on protecting business-critical applications since 2009. We target the application layer with our Onapsis platform and serve an essential part of our clients’ plans to protect their business-critical SAP applications from ransomware attacks.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By providing automatic visibility into critical vulnerabilities, missing important patches and security updates, misconfigurations, and insecure interfaces, Onapsis identifies all the open doors. This is a crucial component in any ransomware prevention initiative. Once the entry points are identified, they can be closed, thereby reducing the attack surface that may lead to ransomware.</li>
    <li>Through continuous monitoring and real-time alerts for threat indicators, Onapsis helps monitor real-time attempts to access critical systems through any remaining open doors. Win precious time to prevent threat actors from gaining further access.</li>
    <li>With code analysis in real time, prior to moving into production, and in transport, Onapsis can help identify foreign code, such as malware, or new vulnerabilities before they get released to the public. Code vulnerabilities may appear to be a minor attack vector, until they’re not, such as in the case of the Solar Winds attack. In Onapsis’ experience, we generally see one critical vulnerability per 1,000 lines of code, but our clients generally have <strong>millions of lines</strong> of custom code. It’s important to close those thousands of open doors to prevent any access to business-critical systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It’s time to think differently about ransomware. We’re in the middle of a perfect storm, with more unprotected SAP applications and remote workers than ever before, expert threat actors who have the expertise to attack these systems, hyperconnected business-critical systems across the cloud, and strained InfoSec teams that may have fallen behind in patching and vulnerability management. Ransomware is the final step of an attack that could utilize a myriad of attack vectors to directly access your business-critical applications.</p>
  <p>Organizations should leverage the powerful native security capabilities of SAP, establish the right risk-based patch, code, and vulnerability management processes, and take advantage of the optimized tools and critical threat intelligence from Onapsis. If they do so, organizations can drastically reduce their risk profiles, stay a step ahead of ransomware groups, and ultimately keep their names out of the news.</p>
