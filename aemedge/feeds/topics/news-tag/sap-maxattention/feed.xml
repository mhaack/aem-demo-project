  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Businesses once had to choose between profitability and sustainability. Now, sustainability can add to your profitability. Your business doesn’t need to think of sustainability as a roadblock to its ability to compete, innovate, or succeed. Your competitors certainly don’t see it that way.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In fact, your industry peers are likely making ambitious sustainability pledges, such as SAP’s own goal for <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">carbon neutrality by 2023</a>. We’re pledging sustainability not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also because efforts toward sustainability can provide everyone with strategic business advantages.

  <h3 id="quick-win-1-start-eliminating-digital-waste">Quick Win #1: Start Eliminating Digital Waste</h3>
  <p>Every minute, businesses generate unbelievable amounts of data. This data has fueled our digital era, empowering businesses with valuable insights about themselves and their customers. But did you know that growing volumes of unnecessary data and inefficient data practices are harming the environment? In fact, every 100 gigabytes of data stored in the cloud produces <a href="https://medium.com/stanford-magazine/carbon-and-the-cloud-d6f481b79dfe">0.2 tons of carbon dioxide each year</a>. This adds up quickly and increases your carbon footprint.</p>
  <p>SAP MaxAttention can help create a better data management strategy that reduces volumes of unused data – and your impact on the environment. Not only that, but this same strategy also empowers you to take advantage of data-driven decision-making because it can make higher quality data more readily available. Your enterprise solutions and software will be able to quickly tap into the data needed to perform powerful analytics, or even to feed the right data to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models. On top of all that, more efficient data management practices can also mean greater savings in your cost of data storage.</p>
  <h3 id="quick-win-2-take-advantage-of-process-automation">Quick Win #2: Take Advantage of Process Automation</h3>
  <p>AI, machine learning, and automation provide process improvements by automating repetitive, manual tasks that burden employees. By reducing manual processes – and the errors and that come with them – your business can continue to cut down on digital waste and other inefficiencies that chip away at sustainability.</p>
  <p>With SAP MaxAttention, you can quickly deploy automated instances that can improve process efficiency. For example, our experts are able to show you where you can digitalize and automate decision-making by using intelligent workflows and business rules. When you cut down on the back-and-forth decision-making between workers, you reduce the digital waste and paper waste that come with those processes. These small gains add up to a more sustainable intelligent enterprise.</p>
  <p>Use the success of these instances to convince the rest of the business of the value of automation. Premium engagements can provide a foundation for the deployment of additional automated instances quickly and at scale with the needs of any business area.</p>

      <div>Lines between industries are blurring, and it isn’t enough for your business to be the best in its class. Automotive newcomers are uprooting long-standing industry leaders and embracing concepts from their friends in high tech. Manufacturers are taking notes from consumer products and debuting as-a-service offerings that increase revenue. Oil and gas companies are transforming into full-scale energy providers. The list goes on.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP solutions and services can help your business start thinking, acting, and innovating like a leader – a leader from another industry, that is.

  <p>Trends and best practices are changing all the time, and it can be hard for a busy business to keep up. You may know your competitors use technologies such as the cloud to provide better customer experiences, but you can’t possibly know how their technology infrastructures look and perform. Yet, this knowledge is a prerequisite to creating a successful and competitive technology strategy.</p>
  <p>More specifically, we can help you uncover the potential that new technology holds for your business and what your IT architecture needs before it can take advantage of automation, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and other next-generation innovations. These innovations are key to realizing the transformation into a sustainable intelligent enterprise. For instance, leaders across industries are using automation to eliminate manual tasks and digital waste that contribute to their carbon footprint.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>One of the most important lessons of the last two years has been the power of innovation when driving genuinely transformative change. With SAP Innovation Awards, we celebrate individuals and organizations that have taken this lesson to heart with a mix of ingenuity, SAP technology, and the support of knowledgeable experts.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Innovations are always top of mind for companies – especially SAP customers. But you won’t find them musing future-minded technology trends such as quantum computing, neural interfaces, or nanotechnology. Instead, they are accomplishing extraordinary feats and delivering meaningful outcomes with existing technology and expertise.</p>
  <p>Certainly, every business has a story of exceptional innovation to tell. And I am proud to share those of our customers – some of which were recognized by <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards.html">SAP Innovation Awards</a> in 2021 for making the world better with assistance from SAP Services and Support offerings.</p>

  <h2 id="enhancing-scale-and-performance-for-heavy-data-workloads">Enhancing Scale and Performance for Heavy Data Workloads</h2>
  <p>When under pressure to meet regulatory requirements, deliver higher margins, and improve customer experiences, companies must improve how they manage increasing volumes of data. But all too often, the limitation of an on-premise landscape does not allow the flexibility, agility, speed, and cost-effectiveness to meet that challenge.</p>
  <p>For one of the SAP Innovation Award winners, the answer was found in a proof of concept created through a joint effort between SAP and Google Cloud. <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/submission-details-2021.html?idea_id=2376">PayPal Holdings</a> (PayPal), which adopted Google Cloud as its core IT partner, chose a combination of Google Cloud and SAP S/4HANA for financial products subledger on a 96 TB scale-out configuration of SAP HANA. The innovation leveraged Google Cloud’s expertise in building scalable, distributed systems and SAP’s relentless focus on delivering mission-critical business process automation.</p>
  <p>Bringing the best of SAP and Google Cloud engineering together, PayPal can benefit from groundbreaking capabilities with higher performance, lower costs, and more flexibility. The technology platform company now runs one of the world’s largest scale-out clusters of SAP HANA. And in return, it accelerated query runtime by 40 times through parallelization, reduced its memory footprint by 78% with dynamic data-tiering techniques, and experienced 24 weeks of continuous operations with zero downtime.</p>
  <h2 id="achieving-health-goals-through-process-standardization">Achieving Health Goals Through Process Standardization</h2>
  <p>During <a href="/covid-19">the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, businesses were concerned with maintaining operational continuity and keeping pace with demand while ensuring a safe and healthy environment for their workforce. However, as one of our award finalists discovered, a complex IT infrastructure involving multiple disparate enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems prevented the ability to run as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>The European division of <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/submission-details-2021.html?idea_id=2471">American Air Filter Company</a> addressed this issue by deploying cloud-based solutions to standardize processes and support localization requirements for different countries. With <a href="https://www.sap.com/services/support-plans/preferred-success-cloud.html">SAP Preferred Success</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/services/implementation/implementation-pkg.html">SAP Value Assurance</a>, and SAP development experts, the division consolidated 13 ERP systems into a single instance of SAP S/4HANA Cloud and gained the agility to achieve meaningful change.</p>
  <p>American Air Filter Company harmonized processes and gained a single view of the truth, providing more transparent and streamlined operations across all business areas. Additionally, its simplified IT infrastructure costs less to maintain and enables the business to take advantage of intelligent technologies to innovate new offerings.</p>
  <h2 id="setting-new-standards-with-embedded-analytics">Setting New Standards with Embedded Analytics</h2>
  <p>Every organization reaches a point where homegrown, mainframe-based business information systems must be replaced to enhance decision-making and enable higher standards for data governance, quality, and security. But the first step is not necessarily ripping out the legacy technology and implementing a completely new architecture, which in most cases can become too operationally disruptive and costly.</p>
  <p>For 2021 finalist <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/submission-details-2021.html?idea_id=2036">Pennsylvania State University</a> (Penn State), expert guidance from SAP Enterprise Support services was needed to help upskill its IT team and pave the way for cutting-edge embedded analytics. The university worked with <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/enterprise-support/enterprise-support-advisory-council.html">SAP Enterprise Support Advisory Council</a> to build a strong foundation in analytics, including through remote, recorded individual and group webinars, to support its digital transformation journey.</p>
  <p>Penn State relied on the <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/enterprise-support/enterprise-support-academy/value-maps.html">SAP Enterprise Support value maps</a> for SAP Analytics solutions to help close any digital skills gaps. The organization engaged with experts, posting questions in value map forums and arranging collaborative sessions with peers. Plus, it used the <a href="https://cal.sap.com/">SAP Cloud Appliance Library</a> tool to help demonstrate and trial innovative data analytics and reporting tools, conduct scoping and sandboxing exercises, and create a proof of concept.</p>
  <p>Relating training material to workflows and real project scenarios enabled Penn State’s employees to apply knowledge more readily and apply feedback as they adopted SAP S/4HANA embedded analytics. And with access to experts who truly understand its challenges, Penn State’s administration staff now has the necessary skills to adapt and run embedded analytics, which will influence how it runs the university.</p>

  <p>During any significant organizational change such as a merger, acquisition, or spin-off, most companies find that their legacy landscape is too complex, lacking in technical depth, redundant, or costly to maintain. Another finalist, <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/submission-details-2021.html?idea_id=2145">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a> (HPE), is no stranger to this challenge.</p>
  <p>When HPE’s parent company, the Hewlett-Packard Company, spun off in 2015, the business needed to simplify applications and processes enterprise-wide to fulfill the world’s growing need for cloud services and intelligent technology. HPE implemented a wide variety of solutions and services to create a solid foundation for the business and enhance IT with powerful next-generation technologies. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/services/premium-engagement/maxattention.html?sort=latest_desc">SAP MaxAttention</a> program provided the guidance necessary to help validate, plan, execute, and test the design of its infrastructure.</p>
  <p>As a result of its efforts with SAP, HPE reduced recommitments to orders after removing the legacy processes that had resulted in rescheduled jobs. The company improved on-time delivery by focusing on its partners and helping them improve their shipping performance. Today, 99.5% of HPE’s customer orders are delivered on time, up from 90% in the past.</p>
  <h2 id="trailblazing-the-future-with-innovation">Trailblazing the Future with Innovation</h2>
  <p>All these stories are exceptional examples of how SAP customers are shaping their innovation effort to trailblaze a future of ongoing productivity and growth. And I am proud that my experts, who support SAP Services and Support offerings, are playing a key role in our customers’ success.</p>
  <p>Throughout the year, I hear our customers express their gratitude to my team of experts for helping them realize their potential as intelligent enterprises. Recently, I read a quote from SAP Innovation Award finalist <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/submission-details-2021.html?idea_id=2118">Delivery Hero</a> that I think best sums up the best of what we offer.</p>
  <p>“Thanks to guidance from SAP Services and Support and the Intelligent Enterprise Institute, we better understand the dependency of customer experience on our delivery processes,” said Sebastian McClintock, global director of Customer Experience at Delivery Hero. “Leveraging SAP S/4HANA, Experience Management solutions from SAP and Qualtrics, and machine learning models, we now know how to improve data flows and best use our data to meet customers’ needs.”</p>
  <h2 id="do-you-have-a-story-to-tell">Do You Have a Story to Tell?</h2>
  <p>Such change is hard work, and extraordinary results deserve to be told. That’s why we host SAP Innovation Awards every year. It allows us to celebrate organizations that are improving business processes, providing faster and more effective customer service, making a difference for current and future employees, and more.</p>
  <p>And we invite all of you – especially if you selected services and support from SAP as your partner or co-partner – to submit a nomination. The call for nominations to <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards.html">SAP Innovation Awards 2022</a> is open now, but only for a few more months. Share your story with us!</p>

  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Inspired by an uncompromising desire to envision the future together with customers, SAP is advancing SAP MaxAttention services into an unparalleled experience. The expertise-driven services portfolio is derived from collaborating with industry-leading companies running high-end hybrid and multi-cloud SAP solutions.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“We focus more and more on our customers’ needs to give them the best possible experiences,” SAP CEO Christian Klein said during the SAP MaxAttention Summit, which took place November 16-17, 2021. “And we hear our customers loud and clear. They want close engagement with SAP and the flexibility to concentrate on their needs and deliver concrete business benefits. But our customers also value guidance that minimizes the effort in implementing new technology.”</p>
  <p>There is little more satisfying than maximizing the value of technology to face significant digital transformation challenges. But when those digital investments are used to help people work and live smarter and more sustainably, the possibilities of a better future for everyone seems nearer than ever.</p>
  <p>As host of this year’s SAP MaxAttention Summit, Kurt Bauer, global senior vice president of Premium Engagements at SAP, highlighted how the company is acting on customer feedback every day to deliver on that vision.</p>
  <p>“We are extremely focused on listening to our customers and how to maximize the value of their SAP solution on their journey toward intelligent and sustainable enterprises,” Bauer declared as he kicked off the event. “As a result, we are advancing <a href="https://www.sap.com/services/premium-engagement/maxattention.html?sort=latest_desc">SAP MaxAttention</a> capabilities toward faster cloud adoption, the RISE with SAP offering leveraging business process intelligence solutions, industry cloud solutions based on the power of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, and design authority around architecture, data, processes, and sustainability with the Intelligent Enterprise Institute at SAP.”</p>

  <h2 id="speed-and-flexibility-to-move-forward">Speed and Flexibility to Move Forward</h2>
  <p>This keen and consistent focus on customers’ transformation vision is leading to the development of transformation-supporting technologies.</p>
  <p>“The speed of change and the need for flexibility for all organizations – regardless of industry, size, and region – are accelerating, especially as they move deeper into the cloud,” explained Augusta Spinelli, interim head of Services and head of Services Intelligent Delivery Group at SAP. “SAP BTP has the unique advantage to support every shift by bringing our business and industry knowledge together to keep the core clean and address possible concerns when moving to the cloud.”</p>
  <p>For instance, SAP launched an assessment service that includes migration tools to help reduce the effort to transition from the SAP Process Integration offering or SAP Process Orchestration software to <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/integration-suite.html">SAP Integration Suite</a>, as part of SAP BTP. The service is virtually fully automated to enable an efficient path to integration and data management.</p>
  <p>This predefined and standardized content reflects the core mission and competency of SAP to guide customers through the implementation of standards that maximize their value and run the best processes. Spinelli shared, “We are helping to ensure they leverage SAP technology in ways that are consistently beneficial to their business – making their transformation journey easier.”</p>
  <p>But as Luka Mucic, CFO and a member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, reminded attendees during a keynote discussion, the role of technology – although a critical enabler – should not be overplayed as the sole healer of all business challenges.</p>
  <p>“At the end of the day, all of us must also have the courage to leave traditional business models behind and radically change how businesses run,” Mucic advised. “If we combine that cultural trait with a people-centric approach and the right mindset across the enterprise, then we can establish truly digitalized and agile business processes that are more powered by data and embedded with artificial intelligence.”</p>
  <h2 id="continuous-transformation-with-premium-engagements">Continuous Transformation with Premium Engagements</h2>
  <p>The dynamic of integrating technology and a transformation mindset continues to be enhanced as SAP customers prioritize the adoption of cloud, industry, and sustainability solutions and RISE with SAP . Every month, new elements are introduced to support these topics with respect to customers’ underlying data and technology. For example, service delivery is being internally changed with the Intelligent Service Delivery Hub from SAP, which provides central access to required information and assets for SAP, partners, and customers.</p>
  <p>For customers worldwide, the increasingly close and exclusive engagement that SAP MaxAttention offers is a crucial part of their overall transformation journey.</p>
  <p>Multinational packaging and paper group Mondi can ask tough questions to assess everything from its ability to execute, scale, and tackle specific challenges. In return, it can identify new levers for better ways of working to help ensure more productive learning behaviors, less operational frustration, and better access to information.</p>
  <p>Kering, on the other hand, is leveraging the services to build a future-oriented foundation that supports fast-paced change and lasting transformation. The multinational corporation of luxury goods brands such as Gucci and Balenciaga uses a pragmatic approach that allows the business to gradually evolve. The company combines a continuous enhancement plan with a smart sequence of testing and learning, quick sharing of discoveries, scouting business trends.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Walgreens Boots Alliance (Walgreens) is transforming its retail operations across more than 9,000 stores in the U.S. with a scale out of SAP S/4HANA in the cloud. The global leader in retail pharmacy took advantage of SAP MaxAttention to maintain a full-size performance test environment throughout its transformation, allowing regular testing of capacity and performance with future volumes and new capabilities.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>When listening to customers such as Mondi, Kering, and Walgreens, it is clear that putting customers front and center of the business is a priority.</p>
  <p>The growing call for sustainability – from consumers, employees, and stakeholders alike – is presenting such a moment to all companies around the globe. Julia White, chief marketing and solutions officer and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, believes this increasingly urgent imperative is an opportunity to bring together industries and political systems and do things differently and better.</p>
  <p>“We all share one planet and carry the responsibility for working collectively toward a more sustainable future,” White surmised. “But more importantly, we have a better understanding of how sustainability and growth are tied together. It’s no longer a choice anymore; and quite possibly, it never was.”</p>
  <p>In the U.S. alone, consumers are directing their spending power to support sustainably minded companies. Since 2014, sustainable products have outgrown conventional products by nearly 20%, and 75% of the millennial population is more willing to take a pay cut to work for a more environmentally or socially responsible company, White explained.</p>
  <p>“As leading companies in all industries have long realized, achieving zero emission, zero waste, and zero inequality is a business network challenge along the value chain,” stated Peter Maier, president of Industries and Customer Advisory at SAP. “Services are important drivers of these sustainability goals, establishing connections for taking action on the sustainability economy.”</p>
  <p>Aligning IT projects against sustainability makes sense. Such transformation is about culture, behavioral change, and big audacious goals, and organizations should consider how their data projects impact sustainability. By driving innovation with interdisciplinary knowledge, experience, and resources from SAP MaxAttention, organizations can benefit from a professional technology assessment and inclusive decision-making that actively involves all stakeholders in the design of digital services.</p>
  <p>One of the many customers that are finding their edge as a more sustainable business is thyssenkrupp Steel. Across 17 plants and development facilities in 11 countries, the multinational conglomerate focused on industrial engineering and steel production is turning one of the dirtiest industries into a better contributor to the health of the planet. To succeed, the company took advantage of guidance to build efficient and standardized processes, enhance master data quality, and improve reporting and analytics. Furthermore, the company is collaborating with SAP experts with a dynamic approach that includes technical architecture, solution, and security design, custom-code quality improvement, data migration assessment, operations readiness, integration validation, and gap validation.</p>
  <h2 id="community-spirit-of-meaningful-transformation">Community Spirit of Meaningful Transformation</h2>
  <p>Throughout SAP MaxAttention Summit this year was made clear that SAP MaxAttention treats every customer as a VIP and part of a global community of front-running companies. It brings together an exclusive experience that those companies deserve to succeed today and for years to come.</p>
  <p>“SAP MaxAttention helps ensure customers get the best advisory services to run the best SAP solutions,” concluded Thomas Saueressig, a member of the Executive Board of SAP SE leading SAP Product Engineering. “At SAP, we always want to take digital transformation to the next level, leveraging more tooling and applications and supporting ongoing engagement to fundamentally drive an amazing value for our customers along the way.”</p>
  <p>Together, SAP customers around the globe are envisioning a future full of promise. And with the help of SAP MaxAttention, they are meeting the expectations of their employees and customers, delivering concrete results that make them work smarter and faster – all fueled by new, groundbreaking processes and solutions.</p>
