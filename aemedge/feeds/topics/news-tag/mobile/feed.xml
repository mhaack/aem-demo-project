    <div>
      <div>In highly dynamic work environments, the pace of work keeps increasing continuously. As roles and responsibilities grow, it can be challenging to stay on top of mounting numbers of approval workflows, even more so with tasks and approval items scattered across systems.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Especially for cross-functional roles, taking broad workflow approval action across the solution portfolio to realize value quickly and efficiently can be difficult at times. Think of a spend manager for example: working in this area, employees need to oversee expenditure across various solutions like SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Fieldglass, and SAP S/4HANA.</p>
  <p>With <strong>SAP Task Center</strong> we provide a new, unified inbox for approvals across multiple applications with a seamless and integrated user experience. Approval items from multiple SAP solutions are gathered in one list and ready to be processed in just one click. Users can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Approve tasks quickly and efficiently</li>
    <li>Reduce time spent navigating through various systems to manage approvals</li>
    <li>Work off just one approval list</li>
    <li>Improve quality and consistency of approvals for business-critical items</li>
    <li>Minimize cost of implementation by automated setup</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SAP Task Center provides approvers with a streamlined application and a people-centric user experience across devices to meet their flexible work styles. The unified inbox offers a smart, unified, and actionable approval application — in both mobile and a web environment.</p>

  <p>SAP Task Center combines multiple powerful capabilities from <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP), like standardized APIs and a consistent security and identity management. Based on SAP Launchpad, it aims to provide a single point to access all assigned workflow tasks across SAP solutions to improve approval time and quality.</p>
  <p>All assigned tasks can be easily accessed, searched, sorted, and filtered in the respective app, based on predefined criteria. With this, end users can either directly process and approve approvals in the unified inbox application, or can navigate to the task details of the integrated SAP solution — like SAP SuccessFactors, SAP S/4HANA Cloud and on premise, SAP Fieldglass — in case of more complex approval workflows.</p>

  <p>In addition to the web application, SAP Task Center is also available within the <a href="/2021/08/sap-mobile-start-launch">SAP Mobile Start</a> app.</p>
  <p>SAP Mobile Start is a native app that serves as the mobile entry point to SAP’s business applications and content, providing users with a consumer-grade experience. Thoughtfully predefined content for typical persona and industry roles allows users to execute mobile-enabled business processes.</p>
  <h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
  <p>SAP Business Technology Platform is the ultimate foundation to intelligently connect people, things, and businesses. To get started with the SAP Task Center requires a consumption-based commercial model in your SAP BTP global account (<a href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-task-center?licenseModel=cpea&#x26;tab=service_plan&#x26;region=all">SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement or Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP</a>).</p>
  <p>In addition, you can access the unified inbox on your mobile devices through SAP Mobile Start , available for iOS on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/sap-mobile-start/id1540195902?l=en">App Store</a>. More details on how to get started with SAP Mobile Start <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/03/three-scenarios-on-how-you-can-get-started-on-sap-mobile-start/">are available here</a>.</p>
  <p>SAP Task Center is integrated into SAP S/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Fieldglass, and SAP SuccessFactors solutions. Further SAP solutions, such as SAP Ariba and SAP Concur, are planned to be supported beginning in the first quarter of 2022. Related details can be accessed in the <a href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?SQ=INTG_WRF&#x26;range=CURRENT-LAST#Q4%202021">SAP Road Map Explorer</a>.</p>
  <p>SAP Task Center realizes an overarching one workflow inbox across end-to-end processes, as outlined in <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/02/520ea921-847d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">SAP’s Integration Strategy paper</a>.</p>
  <p>Over the last 18 months, many more integration innovations have been delivered. Our commitment remains unchanged: we support every customer in their journey to run as an intelligent enterprise.</p>

A jogger receives a message on her smartwatch during her training lap: there’s a bottleneck at the brewery, consumer demand has increased, the production speed needs to go up.

  <p><em>Florian Heretsch</em></p>
  <p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/aQymPwrfIA4">video</a> SAP published alongside the new SAP Mobile Start app amplifies a new mobile experience. The shown elements, however, are not really new: wearables, notifications, apps. Rather, it’s about the <em>how</em>: editing, timing, and a bass-heavy beat all mesh together, perfectly timed.</p>
  <p>The emotionally loaded pacing of the clip symbolizes how SAP wants to increase the “beats per minute” in mobile user experience. At the DJ booth, this is called pitching. And indeed, it’s a kind of market pitch, meant to evoke a sense that something new is coming for SAP’s customers.</p>
  <p>Florian Heretsch, vice president and head of the new Mobile Experience &#x26; Engineering Unit at SAP, explains what SAP Mobile Start means for the initiative and who is setting the pace.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: SAP Mobile Start has recently been released in the Apple App Store. An Android version will follow soon. Why should I install the app now?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Heretsch:</strong> Because it’s the new mobile entry point into the world of SAP, with a whole new user experience! With this app, you can get a simple, centralized overview of the SAP processes and applications that are relevant to you. The app integrates system features like search, widgets, and notifications so that you can have the latest business numbers from <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> on your home screen at all times.</p>
  <p>The key is the native experience. This is very different from a web app in a mobile browser! That’s what it’s all about: we want to make mobile working easier for SAP customers and their employees. We have kept the technical conditions as simple as possible, such as the back-end connection and the use of SAP Launchpad. An end user will ideally not even notice that.</p>
  <p><strong>And who is already benefiting from the app today?</strong></p>
  <p>The app helps manage projects, for example, or when you have to react quickly to delivery issues. Together with our customers and users around the world, we have created personas for a wide range of usage scenarios. We provide tailored content and individual configuration options. All of this with a simple user interface, supported by the amazing power and reliability of SAP’s industry experience that our customers trust. The next version of the app will include the “Task Center,” a shared inbox that will provide HR and purchasing workflows, among other things. The goal is to bundle all of SAP’s standard workflows into one app.</p>
  <p><strong>Does SAP also use the app internally?</strong></p>
  <p>Using our own software for over 102,000 employees and gaining experience from it is extremely important for us. After a Beta release, SAP Mobile Start will be the native entry point for role-based use of SAP apps internally at the beginning of 2022. This will also include SAP Fiori apps with the advantage of access to push notifications and full voice control.</p>
  <p><strong>It sounds like there’s more to come. SAP has been offering mobile front ends for business processes and workflows for some time now. What’s new now?</strong></p>
  <p>We are now putting way more emphasis on creating a holistic mobile experience, with the ultimate goal of every customer feeling at home immediately. With SAP Mobile Start, we are starting to harmonize all SAP apps in terms of design and function; we’re not just bundling more functions. There have to be additional easy-to-use apps for different needs, but an app suite design that’s deeply integrated with the latest features of iOS or Android devices. And all of this delivers an overall experience that makes users excited to work with our apps.</p>
  <p><strong>Many younger people in the business world have had mobile apps since they can remember. How is SAP adapting to their expectations? What can we learn from the use of social media, for example?</strong></p>
  <p>Actually, many of the younger people we’re talking about have long been working at – and with – SAP. At the same time, we are taking a close look at different user communities. We have studies showing that for Germany and comparable markets, people across all age groups and professions want their employers to provide them with the mobile tools they know from their private lives. In other words, many of us have long been communicating and cooperating at a higher level at home than possible in the workplace.</p>
  <p><strong>And how does SAP intend to change that?</strong></p>

  <p>By putting a big exclamation mark behind the necessity of truly changing the possibilities of how work is being done in an intelligent enterprise. By taking a more differentiated look at mobile usage behavior versus desktop usage behavior. Mobile is about short actions without having to think much – but each of these interactions has to be to spot on! These are moments that matter, served by micro-experiences. Such magic moments and the way we interact with processes and tasks have the power to create an appealing user experience. I don’t want to have cumbersome input fields. I want swipes, animations, everything fluid, elegant!</p>

  <p><strong>Micro-experiences and smart features speed up the experience. So, no complex CRM or ERP processes on mobile?</strong></p>
  <p>I don’t think you need to bring all the roles and functions to mobile. I don’t see big analytics and charts there. The <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> has accelerated the change of our working behavior. Today, it’s about the freedom to decide where and when to do what. I don’t want to have to rely on a big screen as I switch back and forth between the office, childcare, or virtual meetings, but I want continuity for my business.</p>
  <p><strong>And what role do features like augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), or specific functions of smartwatches play in this?</strong></p>
  <p>We not only have to be technologically up-to-date, we also want to actively drive this development. The minimum is to make effective use of current device functions, such as machine learning in mobile operating systems or voice control. But we are currently trying out a lot here and are looking very closely at the consumer market in order to bring corresponding experiences into the business environment as well.</p>
  <p><strong>You’ve called this “the Intelligent Enterprise at your fingertips.”</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, exactly. SAP Mobile Start is both an element and an accelerator of SAP’s intelligent enterprise strategy. In addition to steering a company, this strategy aims to make work smarter. The Intelligent Enterprise thrives on comprehensive, technical integration of the SAP landscape. Our mobile developers can help create this. In this way, our apps become showcases for the Intelligent Enterprise.</p>
  <p><strong>By contrast, prominent SAP apps for expense management or HR, for example, still seem relatively detached from other apps in terms of look and feel.</strong></p>
  <p>As said, one of the elements of our new mobile experience strategy is a stringent portfolio of apps and a harmonized look and feel.</p>
  <p><strong>The team responsible for SAP’s new apps and mobile strategy was also involved in the <a href="/2020/06/corona-warn-app-deutsche-telekom-sap">Corona Warn App</a>, Germany’s app to help fight the spread of COVID-19. Can we also expect to open new business areas here?</strong></p>
  <p>Part of the team developed the first versions. We learned a lot in the process, and not just because we built a consumer app. In travel and expense management we had something like this with TripIt, but the Corona Warn App has created a whole new user environment and perception. This experience will surely influence our business app development. There might be other consumer apps, but the focus will remain on our business offering.</p>
  <p><strong>SAP Mobile Start is fresh in the App Store. An Android version is to follow. SAP is now also publishing its new experience strategy. What is “the next big thing”?</strong></p>
  <p>One of the next steps will be to further develop and establish SAP Mobile Start, for example by integrating the task center for workflows coming from a wide range of systems. We are now also going into feedback rounds with the first SAP Mobile Start customers in order to expand the app. Additionally, there will be new native apps for various industries that will push our mobile experience vision further. We are going to show that we are serious about our new claim.</p>

      <div>The future of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-enterprise.html">Intelligent Enterprise</a> will depend on high-speed digital connectivity to enable powerful innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge services to manage supply chains and deliver new experiences. To meet this demand, 5G (fifth-generation wireless networking technology) is increasingly being deployed to process the vast amounts of data being collected from the connected devices that power the Intelligent Enterprise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By 2025, 5G will enable <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/">1.8 billion</a> connections and bring a contribution of <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GSMA_MobileEconomy2020_Global.pdf">US$2.2 trillion</a> to the global economy between 2024 and 2034, according to <a href="https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/">GSMA Intelligence</a>, the research arm of the global trade organization for the mobile industry.</p>

  <h2 id="enterprises-unlock-the-value-of-5g-with-sap">Enterprises Unlock the Value of 5G with SAP</h2>
  <p>Since the launch of <a href="/2019/02/sap-5g-innovation-council-accelerates-new-business-models">SAP’s 5G Innovation Council</a> in 2018, SAP has been leveraging its unique cross-industry expertise, rich partner ecosystem, and global coverage to unlock value from 5G projects for its customers. In collaboration with a network of strategic partners, SAP is engaging customers in innovation sessions to identify and prioritize use cases that tap new revenue models and monetization strategies.</p>
  <p>Some of these projects include augmented reality (AR)-enabled immersive consumer experiences, guaranteed payments in a stadium using 5G <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GSMA-An-Introduction-to-Network-Slicing.pdf">network slicing</a>, omnichannel retail with frictionless payments, and robotic surgeries in healthcare, as well as autonomous forklifts and robotic service drones for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management/industry-4-0.html">Industry 4.0</a>.</p>
  <p>“Where we’ve really seen the power of 5G is around private network deployments for enterprise customers,” says Frank Wilde, vice president, Global Center of Excellence, SAP Labs in Palo Alto, who has been working with SAP customers to integrate 5G technology into their digital strategy. SAP is positioned to work with customers to maximize the potential of their custom use cases or any of the more than 30 industry use cases that SAP has available for retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and oil and gas. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> offering and digital transformation as a service means even greater possibilities for customers to take control of their digital journey when implementing new innovations.</p>
  <h2 id="5g-ultra-wideband-networks-enable-the-intelligent-enterprise">5G Ultra-Wideband Networks Enable the Intelligent Enterprise</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers/82400/what-is-5g">advantages of 5G</a> over the current standard 4G arguably include: greater bandwidth for faster data processing; lower latency for greater responsiveness, which produces even greater benefits when combined with edge computing; and the ability to have more devices connected to the network simultaneously, which has huge implications for IoT-enabled sensors and smart devices. For the enterprise, among the greatest benefits come from 5G’s capacity for <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GSMA-An-Introduction-to-Network-Slicing.pdf">network slicing</a>, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/5g-latency">low latency</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/edge-services.html#:~:text=SAP%20Edge%20Services%20enables%20powerful,edge%20with%20SAP%20Edge%20Services.">edge computing</a>.</p>
  <p>5G technology is a game changer for the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-enterprise.html">Intelligent Enterprise</a>; however, the 5G opportunity can still be something of a black box for decision-makers. Some may question why 4G isn’t good enough. Wilde responds by emphasizing the case for greater automation and simplification that is possible within a 5G network. “When you compare a 5G environment to a 4G environment, it’s like an eight-lane highway to a two-lane highway,” says Wilde. “You have additional bandwidth to work with and software-defined networking capabilities to be able to charge for services and create network slices. It’s a much more tightly coupled network.”</p>

  <p>Strategic partnerships are the backbone of SAP’s strategy in the 5G space, allowing it to capitalize on its enterprise business strengths while drawing on the multi-varied strengths of a vast ecosystem of technology partners. As a global company, SAP has built deep partnerships with the telecommunications industry across all regions. That approach brings big benefits for customers in the form of global coverage for their 5G projects using an established reference architecture to globally deploy a 5G edge platform or set of services.</p>
  <p>“SAP is uniquely positioned so that we can sit down with each telco globally and deploy a merchant 5G service that a small-to-medium business can leverage anywhere around the world,” says Wilde, who supports the need for partnerships to successfully deploy 5G solutions. “We’re streamlining the value chain around telcos, hardware manufacturers, software providers, and service integrators. We do the heavy lifting for our customers, which is one of the core value-adds that SAP is able to bring. We have both the customer network and the partner network to bring these solutions to life, unlike our competition.”</p>
  <h2 id="mwc21-inspire-the-future-with-5g">MWC21: Inspire the Future with 5G</h2>
  <p>SAP will participate virtually in <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/">MWC21</a>, scheduled for June 28-July 1 in Barcelona, Spain. Billed as the world’s biggest technology show, the event typically draws 100,000 attendees from around the world. In 2020, the show was canceled due to the pandemic. The MWC21 agenda will offer a hybrid mix of in-person and virtual content. The theme for the SAP presence at MWC21 is <strong>Inspire the Future with 5G</strong>.

      <div>SAP’s new mobile experience puts people at the heart of business processes — anywhere and anytime.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Over the past years, working styles have been drastically changing in many industries with mobile becoming the prevailing experience and a critical driver of process innovation. In the coming years, business processes will become increasingly automated and decisions will be made even faster without being in an office or at a desk. Data generated by intelligent, connected devices will reshape the core processes of many industries. The <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic has further accelerated the transformation toward a digital and flexible way of working.</p>
  <p>What does not change is that people need to be at the heart of processes and software alike, calling for experiences that truly matter to them and help them to get their job or tasks done anytime, anywhere, regardless of their work style. This is often overlooked when talking about business or IT processes in general. And that clearly needs to change.</p>

  <p><em>Learn more about SAP’s new mobile experience powered by the Intelligent Enterprise.</em></p>
  <p>SAP’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/intelligent-enterprise.html">integrations and end-to-end processes</a> are important enablers for creating business value. The Intelligent Enterprise, however, must be a people-centric system that adapts to business needs by providing contextually relevant insights to users, allowing them to make informed decisions in real time and from anywhere.</p>
  <p>This year at <a href="https://reg.sapevents.sap.com/flow/sap/sapphirenow2021/portal/page/sessions/session/1617041787652001uaTG">SAPPHIRE NOW</a>, we introduce SAP’s new mobile experience and share a glimpse of our new native entry point app: <strong>SAP Mobile Start</strong>.</p>

  <h2 id="personal-intuitive-contextual-delightful">Personal, Intuitive, Contextual, Delightful</h2>
  <p>Content, apps, and tasks need to be easily and intuitively accessible for users in one place so they can stay informed, take action, and dive into their work – no matter where they are or what time of the day it is. This experience needs to feel personal, relevant, and frictionless across all devices.</p>
  <p>During the course of a workday, users encounter numerous so-called micro-experiences that differ based on their work and responsibilities. These individual interactions are the basis for completing daily tasks and can be repetitive or constantly changing. Think of situations like approving a requisition, helping customers, reviewing financial statements, submitting a leave request, or planning a trip.</p>
  <p>To serve different role types best, SAP is using value engineering to define a mobile-first portfolio that combines similar functionality of different apps and helps ensure the right user experience, including desktop and web experiences for infrequent mobile users as needed. Each work context is being addressed with pre-built integration, on-device intelligence, and highly tuned workflows and collaboration capabilities.</p>
  <p>Take a warehouse clerk as an example. In this role, mobile solutions need to support all daily tasks, ranging from unloading to picking, packing, and shipping. Optimized business processes and workflows should minimize unnecessary user interaction steps by leveraging the latest on-device technologies like a Matrixscan to scan multiple barcodes at once, real-time insights through augmented reality overlays, and optimized routes through the warehouse with indoor navigation.</p>

  <p>On-device intelligence in every business moment provides the best of cloud intelligence (composing end-to-end processes) and the best of edge intelligence (total experience for mobile users in their unique environment), extending the value and reach of the Intelligent Enterprise to everyone’s fingertips.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, people run the software we build. Therefore, we envision the Intelligent Enterprise as a people-centric system that provides contextually relevant insights, so informed decisions can be made in real time and from anywhere. This is only the start of much more to come.</p>
  <p>Embark with us on a user experience journey that puts people at the heart of business software and processes — from start to finish.</p>

      <div>The <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> has been a catalyst for change, accelerating the demand for digital experiences and opening the way for new innovations across industries.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In retail, hit particularly hard in 2020, customer engagement is now largely defined by the digital experience of the consumer. As the economy reopens, consumers who remained loyal to their favorite brands throughout months of lockdowns now expect an omnichannel experience that seamlessly merges their online shopping preferences with a personalized and rewarding in-store experience.</p>
  <p>Retailers face the additional challenge of having lots of assets to manage. In a grocery store, for example, there are freezers, coolers, and HVAC systems. At the distribution center, there are those same assets plus conveyor belts, forklifts, and more. Keeping all of this equipment running smoothly is critical to ensuring products stay fresh and are delivered on time.</p>
  <p>Savvy retailers now understand that digital transformation is the key to managing a complex supply chain and providing a superior consumer experience that generates brand loyalty. Increasingly, retailers are looking to fifth generation (<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers/82400/what-is-5g">5G</a>) technology in combination with edge services as a powerful differentiator to deliver consumer experiences and leapfrog the competition to greater profitability. They are turning to SAP to help bring these 5G experiences to life with SAP’s data platform and supply chain services.</p>

  <h2 id="5g-advantages">5G Advantages</h2>
  <p>For intelligent enterprises, the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cell-phone-service-providers/82400/what-is-5g">advantages of 5G</a> over the current standard 4G include greater bandwidth for faster data processing; lower latency for greater responsiveness, which produces even greater benefits when combined with edge computing; and the ability to have more devices connected to the network simultaneously, which has huge implications for IoT-enabled sensors and smart devices. The greatest benefits come from 5G’s capacity for <a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GSMA-An-Introduction-to-Network-Slicing.pdf">network slicing</a>, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/5g-latency">low latency</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/edge-services.html#:~:text=SAP%20Edge%20Services%20enables%20powerful,edge%20with%20SAP%20Edge%20Services.">edge computing</a>.</p>
  <p>GSMA Intelligence, the research arm of the global trade organization for the mobile industry, forecasts that 5G will bring <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/">1.8 billion</a> connections by 2025 and a contribution of <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GSMA_MobileEconomy2020_Global.pdf">$2.2 trillion</a> to the global economy between 2024 and 2034</p>

  <p>SAP now offers a solution architecture and monetization platform that enables retailers to gain efficiencies, provide amazing consumer experiences, and unlock new revenue streams with 5G. From the supply chain to the in-store experience, SAP is helping the retail industry realize the exciting possibilities for the store of the future.</p>
  <p>“SAP is uniquely positioned to serve as the glue pulling these pieces together – from the retailer, the brand, and a fintech – and covering that last digital mile,” says Frank Wilde, vice president, Global Center of Excellence, SAP Labs in Palo Alto, who has been working with SAP customers to integrate 5G technology into their digital strategy. “That’s what we’re very excited about when we think about how is 5G coming to life.”</p>
  <p>For example, when consumers enter a shop that leverages 5G, they will see digital signage for a more personalized in-store shopping experience. When they pick up a product like a box of cereal from a store shelf, they will be able to use their 5G-enabled smartphone to have an immersive experience while learning about the ingredients and product information. After placing that product in their cart, the store’s smart shelf system will trigger a reorder notification to a distribution center and later align the product to a planogram to ensure that new stock is displayed on the shelf correctly, ultimately freeing up the shop’s staff from low value-add activities. To cap off the outing, the consumer’s mobile fintech vendor will streamline the checkout with a frictionless 5G experience.</p>
  <p>While consumers enjoy a state-of-the-art shopping experience, retailers can be confident that everything is running smoothly behind the scenes. For example, food spoilage is a vexing problem for many retailers that costs the industry billions of dollars a year. When freezers or coolers breakdown, the retailer has to remove saleable product from the store floor and arrange repairs which can take hours if not days, depending on the problem. Unless there is alternative cooling available, any food removed will be considered spoiled and must be thrown away.</p>
  <p>SAP and 5G technology provide a solution. Internet of Things (IoT) devices for monitoring equipment can check the temperature, vibration levels, and other metrics of assets to provide a 24×7 health status to <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/predictive-asset-insights.html">SAP Predictive Asset Insights</a>. If an anomaly is detected, an alert can be sent to the store operations manager in advance of the cooler breaking down. This early notification provides the time needed to either fix or replace the aging unit, saving thousands of dollars of lost food while keeping customers satisfied.</p>
  <p>Any of these experiences also can be monetized as a service with the use of <a href="https://blog.sap-press.com/what-is-sap-brim">SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/convergent-mediation.html">SAP Convergent Mediation by DigitalRoute</a>, generating additional income for retailers and brands. SAP customers can explore the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> offering and digital transformation as a service as a means to take control of their digital journey with the right technologies for their business.</p>
