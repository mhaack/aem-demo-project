  <p>Deutsche Telekom is the first enterprise to implement RISE with SAP through SAP’s recently expanded partnership with <a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/tsi-announces-expanded-partnership-with-sap-1057448">T-Systems as a premium supplier of RISE with SAP</a>, marking a significant milestone in the relationship between SAP and Deutsche Telekom.</p>
  <p>As Europe’s largest telecommunications provider, with more than 252 million mobile customers, 25 million fixed-network lines and 22 million broadband lines, Deutsche Telekom operates in more than 50 countries. Aligned with the company’s vision to be the leading digital telecommunications provider in the world, Deutsche Telekom has chosen RISE with SAP to transform a major part of its ERP landscape to SAP S/4HANA Cloud. As a premium supplier of RISE with SAP, T-Systems will migrate, consolidate and manage more than 300 systems into the public and private cloud using T-Systems’ Future Cloud Infrastructure (FCI) and select hyperscalers.

  <p>Peter Leukert, chief information officer of Deutsche Telekom, said, “SAP is a trusted and important partner for Deutsche Telekom in both reliably running core business processes and accelerating innovation in the cloud. Through RISE with SAP, we can drive business transformation and take our partnership to new heights. With SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Deutsche Telekom will be able to drive efficiency across key business functions such as logistics, procurement and finance.”</p>
  <p>“Deutsche Telekom’s decision to select RISE with SAP to migrate and streamline more than 300 of their systems to the cloud marks an important milestone in their business transformation and continues a long history of our two companies innovating together for our customers,” said Scott Russell, member of the executive board of SAP SE, customer success. “This investment by Deutsche Telekom will give them new capabilities, drive greater efficiencies, and allow them to access key insights from across their enterprise so they can adjust to changing market conditions and seize new opportunities faster than they could before. We look forward to supporting Deutsche Telekom in this exciting new era of their cloud transformation.”</p>

      <div><strong>What’s News</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Global company spending on cloud-based infrastructure continues to surge, topping $50 billion for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
  <p>Data compiled by Synergy Research Group based on the latest earnings reports shows enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services up 36% from the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>
  <p>Amazon continues to lead the cloud infrastructure market with a steady worldwide market share of around 32-33%. But AWS faces growing competition from Microsoft, which is continuing to grow its market share — up almost nine percentage points since the end of 2017 — that stood at 21% in the fourth quarter. Google and Alibaba also continue to grow market share, while in aggregate the long tail of small- to medium-sized cloud providers see revenues growing steadily but market shares declining.</p>

  <h2 id="saps-take">SAP’s Take</h2>
  <p>The latest cloud infrastructure spending figures underscore the massive shift by companies across the globe from running enterprise applications and consumer services on their own hardware (on premise) to the cloud.</p>
  <p>This trend, which has been accelerated by the global pandemic, reflects the benefits in terms of flexibility, speed and scalability of the move to the cloud, together with the growing imperative for companies to transform into intelligent sustainable enterprises.</p>
  <p>Companies that have made the move to the cloud will be best positioned to respond to the challenges and opportunities in their markets in the future, including rapidly changing customer demand, fierce competition and unexpected disruptions like natural disasters, supply chain problems and the next pandemic.</p>
  <p>“Cloud solutions enable companies to move faster and be more agile while better meeting modern customer, partner and employee expectations for connectedness and mobility,” says SAP Executive Board Member <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/leadership/scott-russell.html">Scott Russell</a>, who leads SAP’s Customer Success organization. “For this reason, we’re seeing more and more customers move to the cloud, driving the evolution of their end-to-end business processes, like recruit to retire, lead to cash, source to pay and design to operate.”</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Enterprise resource planning is a type of software that shares information between different functions in real time.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Its roots can be traced back to the 1960s, when manufacturers developed material requirements planning software, or MRP, to calculate the components to order for a given production plan.</p>
  <p>By 1990, the needs of adjacent departments, such as finance, human resources, and distribution, had been added. Information was both shared between departments in real time and enriched with logic to replace repetitive tasks. Gartner coined the term enterprise resource planning for this new class of application.</p>
  <p>Since then, enterprise applications have continued to extend information sharing, both inside and outside of the corporation, and enriched it with evermore sophisticated logic, such as artificial intelligence (AI). Furthermore, enterprise architectures have moved from monolithic, on-premise applications to ever more granular components in the cloud that each company can combine differently to meet its unique needs. While these components go by many different names, the term ERP is often used to describe the composite solution that forms the backbone of an enterprise’s business processes.</p>
  <p>What does this mean for the average consumer? Cloud services optimize everything from the life span of wind turbines to how, when, and where we charge electric vehicles.</p>

    <div>
      <div>As a leading multinational oil and gas company Chevron is dedicated to building reliable, affordable, and ever-cleaner energy in all operations, including with subsidiaries.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>However, over time, it became clear that some of its complex legacy systems were not poised to meet the requisite challenges going forward, especially with SAP’s support for SAP ECC — an impactful solution in Chevron’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) portfolio — coming to an end in 2027. That’s why Chevron is now teaming up with SAP as a customer and co-innovation partner to transform its digital core and position itself for the cloud future.</p>
  <p>“Our motivation was clear: We are embracing a more reliable digital foundation that can enhance production efficiency and enable faster, more informed decisions,” said Michelle LaPoint, general manager of Enterprise Digital Delivery at Chevron. “We wanted up-to-the-minute, forward-looking, embedded analytics and the ability to simplify enterprise processes, automate where possible, and innovate around the digital core going into the future.”</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="designing-a-clean-digital-core">Designing a Clean Digital Core</h2>
  <p>Currently, Chevron operates on more than a dozen distinct ERP systems across its business segments. Given that complex landscape, and taking into account the varying processes across business units, standardizing business processes, data, and technology were top of mind for business and IT leadership.</p>
  <p>“For a large company like Chevron, transformation is a global, phased, multi-year journey,” said LaPoint. “We want one common platform with standard data and processes and now we’re well on the path toward that goal.”</p>
  <p>Historically, Chevron modified and customized its legacy systems to meet complex and varying global requirements. By transforming its digital core, the company is now working to position itself for whatever comes next, taking advantage of SAP’s standard cloud product to adopt new functionality as it becomes available in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a>. It is expected that this will enable Chevron to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase overall speed and agility</li>
    <li>Decrease total cost of ownership of business solutions</li>
    <li>Drive greater digital innovation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>More so, through its co-innovation partnership with SAP, Chevron is working to position itself as a key player in what the “standard” product will look like in the months and years to come.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For large customers, the standard functionality of SAP software may not perfectly line up with their sophisticated system needs and requirements. That’s where SAP’s co-innovation program comes into play. Partners like Chevron regularly connect with the SAP Services team to discuss their business needs and make their voices heard regarding the overall product road map going forward.</p>
  <p>“This is just an extension of working closely with SAP as a co-innovation partner,” said Rajesh Sahajwani, services partner at SAP. “We are the design authority. We create the way ‘standard’ runs. It’s important that we are in communication with our largest customers, so we can find gaps, feed information to our product teams, and strengthen our future product road map. Ultimately, it’s all about building a better product.”</p>
  <p>Chevron’s close collaboration with SAP in asset management is already delivering a reduction in future technical costs. This is made possible by Chevron’s strong governance efforts and positions the company as a unique SAP partner and customer going forward.</p>
  <p>In other words, this partnership is expected to keep each company from remaining stagnant on the path to the cloud, so that tomorrow’s Chevron — and tomorrow’s SAP — will be even better than today’s.</p>

      <div>Our customers face new market conditions, competition and challenges every day, so they rely on us to deliver the technology and solutions to help them survive and thrive in this dynamic and increasingly digital environment. SAP’s deep industry domain knowledge has enabled us to deliver the best and most innovative business process support for our customers for almost 50 years.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By continuously evolving our enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, we are helping our customers modernize business processes and helping them adjust to a new IT reality at the same time. As <a href="/author/thomassaueressig">I’ve said before</a>, this reality combines flexibility, agility, and choice for our customers: Flexibility through a modular yet integrated approach to enterprise software, agility through business processes that can be adapted as needed, and choice for customers to operate their systems on the infrastructure of their choice. And we can certainly add the need for collaborative, networked, and sustainable solutions here.</p>
  <p>One of my favorite examples of how SAP is helping customers adapt and modernize their business processes comes from the retail sector and relates to the impact of the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic. E-commerce has surged during the pandemic as consumers faced lockdowns and sought the relative safety of online shopping. This surge in e-commerce has had dramatic implications for traditional retailers that have had to pivot quickly from primarily in-store sales to online platforms but have also had to deal with much higher levels of returns.</p>
  <p>Consumers are more likely to return something when bought online compared to offline purchases. This is particularly true in fashion retail because there is a much higher probability that a particular size doesn’t fit or the color is not quite what the consumer was expecting. Online customers also often bracket-purchase — ordering several similar items or sizes to ensure that one is the right fit and return the others.</p>
  <p>This represents a significant problem for traditional retailers that were not used to dealing with such high levels of returns and that, in the past, often outsourced the handling of returns. Returns — or reverse logistics, as the process is sometimes called — is a costly and time-consuming part of the daily life of the supply chain.</p>
  <p>Companies need to make decisions on where to return the stock, how to handle the stock when returned, and whether the customer will receive a refund or a replacement. Typically, these operations were optimized for time in order to keep customers happy, even if this meant destroying returned goods.</p>
  <p>Retailers know that the return experience can break or build customer loyalty and trust, and that’s why they aim to process returns and provide refunds to customers as quickly as possible. But destroying — and even storing — returned items is potentially bad for the environment and represents a monetary loss. According to UK’s online retail association, <a href="https://www.imrg.org/uploads/media/default/0001/09/aee8f77eb4d47ccae59293c2518ea67641e5a89d.pdf?st">69% of shoppers confirm that the quality of the returns service strongly influences the retailers where they will shop</a>.</p>

  <p>Recognizing these problems, SAP has developed an innovative solution that we call <strong>SAP Intelligent Returns Management</strong>, a returns optimization solution that guides products from customers’ hands to the final dispositioning steps, maximizing both the customer experience and company margins. It uses routing and dispositioning decisions driven by artificial intelligence (AI) to maximize our customers’ sales and profits.</p>
  <p>SAP Intelligent Returns Management benefits consumers, retailers, and other stakeholders — and it helps customers operate more sustainably. Consumers benefit because we help our customers make the returns process easy, and that delivers the intended consumer experience. Our retail customers know that brand loyalty is fragile and can be lost quickly if a returns process is anything but straightforward and smooth. They need to optimize their return process to be efficient and ensure a great customer experience. When goods arrive at their return centers, retailers want to be able to make fast decisions about what to do with them: Should they dispose of the goods? Should they do a quality check and re-certify them for sale, or send them to an agent such as outlet or reseller?</p>
  <p>Our solution intelligently recommends return options for consumers optimizing for both the customer experience and the retailer and recommends disposition decisions for warehouse teams to limit value leakage. But it also provides business leaders with newfound visibility into the end-to-end returns process, enabling them to make data-based decisions.</p>
  <p>Particularly, retailers can use the embedded analytics to understand what is selling and what is not. Does a particular item always come back because it does not meet expectations in terms of size or look? Is a particular color not selling or is a style out of fashion? Whatever the reason, they can inform the design team and stem a problem at the source by not offering products that do not meet expectations, and thereby be more sustainable.</p>
  <p>SAP has offered a returns solution in the past, but it was a back-end, logistics solution. Now, with SAP Intelligent Returns Management sitting at the intersection of cloud ERP and SAP’s industry cloud, we have closed the gap between front office and back office. That’s the biggest advantage our solutions bring to fashion retailers and the like.</p>

      <div>There is hardly an article today that does not refer to the times we live in and the impact it has on us and our work. The pandemic has compelled communities and organizations to treat <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> as a stress test for the future and made us reconsider, rethink, and renew our relationships with our stakeholders accordingly.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Today’s new normal requires businesses to pivot and adapt with speed. Customers sense the urgency to digitally transform their businesses to survive and gain an advantage through the pandemic and beyond.</p>
  <p>Digital transformation has to be holistic, meaning it needs to encompass the entire value chain, every business department, and internal and external factors. It is crucial that companies align their digital transformation efforts with their individual strategic business goals. Transformation strategies across organizations can look similar as — by their very nature — the focus is firmly on big-picture items: technologies, capabilities, business goals.</p>
  <p>However, specific plans need to vary widely through the expectations, priorities, needs, and types of interactions that take place among the people who directly impact how a company grows and changes.</p>
  <p>Addressing all these variables, SAP has launched a flagship offering for holistic <a href="/2021/01/rise-with-sap-business-transformation-as-a-service">business transformation as a service</a> with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a>, where we can help customers to reimagine business models and processes end to end in order to deliver the best business outcomes.</p>
  <p>In doing so, we recognize and acknowledge that every customer has a different context and a different point of departure. This new approach will enable them to keep their eye on the <a href="/2021/01/rise-with-sap-innovation-speed-agility">goal of the Intelligent Enterprise</a>.</p>
  <p>With RISE with SAP, the customer’s migration and business change aspects of their journey is completely on their terms and their timeline. A redesign of their business plans and processes demands new thinking and new technologies that unlock new ways of doing business. This business evolution is made simpler by bringing together all the components of our new offering under a single subscription and in alignment with our partners. It is anchored by SAP S/4HANA Cloud and will ultimately help accelerate digital transformation for our customers, taking them from wherever they are today to become an intelligent enterprise.</p>

  <p>A key tenet of RISE with SAP is that customers can decide when and how they want to migrate their enterprise resource planning (ERP) to the cloud. As a part of the RISE with SAP offering, the customer has primarily two options for deploying SAP S/4HANA Cloud as their digital core.</p>
  <p><strong>SAP S/4HANA Cloud</strong> is our default public cloud offering. This is the preferred deployment model for all customers opting for a greenfield, best practice implementation and where functional extensibility and localization requirements can be addressed. With this, customers have access to a complete, modern, native SaaS ERP solution with the full benefits of public cloud. This enables them to reimagine business processes fueled by intelligent technologies. SAP S/4HANA Cloud offers standardized processes based on industry best practices, which provide the innovation companies require as well as the simpler SAP-managed solution life-cycle management customers expect. In addition, it provides customers the flexibility to configure and extend the pre-configured best practice processes to match their unique requirements.</p>
  <p><strong>SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition,</strong> targets customers that plan to convert to SAP S/4HANA Cloud and carry over enhancements or modifications with the ability to extend and enhance. This deployment option will help rapid conversion to a cloud-based architecture, stitching in the flexibility of a traditional on-premise application as well a subscription-based cloud economics. It is a simple and standardized offering with predefined materials including pre-sized and standardized infrastructure assumptions, clear and consistent services and service-level agreements, and a three-tier standard system landscape. Our continuous focus on customer-centricity and the value of our conversations with and feedback from all stakeholder groups are a deciding factor in what we offer our customers and how we back them up in their business decisions — no matter where and how they are placed.</p>

  <p>The driving factor for any ERP decision needs to be value and time to value. Let’s start with <strong>value</strong>.</p>
  <p>With SAP S/4HANA Cloud we enable the subscription economy, allowing companies across all industries to establish subscription and usage-based business models and helping ensure that revenue recognition takes place to optimize the financial outcomes for the company. SAP S/4HANA Cloud is at the heart of Industry 4.0, building out the digital thread from engineering to manufacturing and logistics, all the way to asset maintenance. SAP S/4HANA Cloud also helps to move from documenting risks to self-healing systems that stay in compliance automatically. It actively manages cash and working capital, which is more important now than ever. These are just some of the innovations we deliver and continue to build out with the next generation of ERP in the cloud.</p>
  <p>In rethinking and constantly re-framing SAP S/4HANA Cloud, we enable companies to become more agile by providing intelligence and insights, which helps to improve decision making, speed up innovation, and offer better customer experiences. SAP S/4HANA Cloud provides real-time insights along with real-time planning, forecasting, and simulation, as well as embedded analytics at each step. It opens up new opportunities for companies to gain value from embedding artificial intelligence, running end-to-end business processes, differentiating with dedicated but integrated industry solutions, and, above all, achieving sustainability goals, thereby enabling competitive differentiation for businesses. With SAP S/4HANA Cloud, organizations can also reimagine and redefine processes with greater ease, develop best practices and identify better ways of working.</p>
  <p>Now let’s look at <strong>time to value</strong>. Whatever deployment option is selected, the customer can choose an approach that helps launch SAP S/4HANA Cloud quickly and efficiently the first time, while continuously delivering advanced technologies to drive sustained innovation. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/activate-methodology.html">SAP Activate</a> provides a clear process of structured and solution-specific practices for businesses to choose how to adopt and extend new and differentiating capabilities across the organization.</p>
  <p>Following the launch of RISE with SAP, we now have the availability of the new <a href="https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/#/group//roadmapOverviewPage/a11ec6d657054bf9">SAP Activate Methodology</a> for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition, that complements SAP Activate Methodology for <a href="https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/#/group//roadmapOverviewPage/IMPS4HANACLDENMGMT">SAP S/4HANA Cloud</a> for our customers adopting SAP’s public cloud offering. This new release builds on the success of the cloud implementation road maps and offers further guidance during the customer’s journey to RISE with SAP.</p>
  <p>Spending time in dialog with our customers and listening carefully to their concerns and challenges has placed us in the unique position of being able to help them grow, develop their business, and adapt proactively. The insights customers have given us are takeaways that provide new techniques for managing customer experiences during and post-pandemic. For example, with the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/17/playbook-for-remote-fit-to-standard-workshops/">playbook for remote fit-to-standard workshops</a>, a significant part of the business continuity and success that we offer includes the right guidance, and governance, the correct process, tools, and accelerators, and, most importantly, the shift in our mindset to be more collaborative and build a bridge to the cloud. The experience and service we provide is vital in helping them navigate any crisis.</p>
  <p>Transforming a business digitally provides the means for it to survive in a complex new world. When things return to normality, our consumers will remember positively the businesses that were helpful and supportive in their times of need. It is an opportunity to help our customers reduce costs, adopt innovations quickly, and enable business transformation to the Intelligent Enterprise.</p>
  <p>It is indeed the basis for the next phase of growth and innovation — no matter what else the future brings.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Against the backdrop of an increasingly foggy and fast-paced business operating environment, the difference between captains of industry who have wired their enterprises up to latest-generation enterprise resource planning (ERP) and those who have not is becoming progressively stark.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="the-new-rules-of-the-game">The New Rules of the Game</h2>
  <p>In today’s ever more complex and rapidly evolving business landscape, mastering uncertainty has become the new competitive edge. Agility and foresight are the future currencies of success. Only a firm that truly knows itself and understands its environment is equipped to thrive.</p>
  <p>If the past year has taught us anything, it is that the status quo no longer holds. Erstwhile formulas for achievement are losing their shine and can be depended upon no more. As the global <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> continues to upend legacy business models and expose supply chain fragilities, digital technologies have been levelling the playing field and empowering upstarts to leapfrog long-standing incumbents.</p>
  <p>As <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/ready-set-go-reinventing-the-organization-for-speed-in-the-post-covid-19-era">McKinsey</a> notes, a new breed of champions is now coming to the fore: one that has been primed for speed and excellence of execution. Tomorrow’s winners will most likely share certain characteristics; they will be the most aware, the flattest, the nimblest, and the most digitally immersive.</p>
  <h2 id="taking-the-plunge">Taking the Plunge</h2>
  <p>Faced with such a volatile, opaque, and complicated operating ecosystem, most midcap and large multinationals have already grasped the urgency of embracing change. According to <a href="https://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/KPMG_CEO_Survey_STUDY.pdf">KPMG</a>, a full 72% of businesses have now resorted to disrupting their own sectors just to survive.</p>
  <p>Moreover, most recognize the need for faster reaction speeds and greater real-time insight into all aspects of their operations – from procurement and supply chain activities to customer experience management and distribution. The question is no longer <em>whether</em> to transition towards becoming an intelligent enterprise, but <em>when</em> and <em>how</em>.</p>
  <p>Adopting cutting-edge digital technology has, of course, been an essential part of this process as data collection and extrapolation are the lifeblood of better insight. One <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-30-gartner-says-sixty-nine-percent-of-boards-of-directors-accelerated-their-digital-business-initiatives-folloing-covid-19-disruptions">Gartner</a> study reveals that over 69% of companies have been ramping up their digital initiatives in the past year alone, whereas a reported 59% are already exploiting advanced data and analytics to inform strategic decision-making.</p>

  <p>For many elite companies and aspiring champions, intelligent ERP is already the only game in town. An impressive 86% of the world’s <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/most-innovative-companies/data-overview">most innovative companies</a>, 75% of the world’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthatodd/2020/01/21/who-are-the-100-most-sustainable-companies-of-2020/?sh=3df5b4d214a4">most sustainable businesses</a>, and 52% of the <a href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/">Fortune 500</a> are, right now, all well advanced in their deployment of SAP S/4HANA.</p>
  <p>This picture becomes even more pronounced in the European theatre of operations where a mighty 98% of EuroStoxx, the top 50 blue-chip representations of super-sector leaders across the Eurozone, run the software. Nor is there any sign of let up or slackening of momentum. On the contrary, since 2020 there has been no less than one SAP S/4HANA go-live every single business hour!</p>
  <p>Interestingly, the shift to this state-of-the-art software is no longer the cumbersome, disruptive, tortuous process it was once purported to be. What formerly may have been a long, arduous trip for those businesses that didn’t quite fit the template has now become an enlightening journey of discovery accessible to companies of all shapes, sizes, and sectoral flavors.</p>

  <p><em>Fast adoptions of SAP S/4HANA are occurring all across the globe</em></p>
  <h2 id="into-the-fast-lane">Into the Fast Lane</h2>
  <p>Indeed, undertaking the leap to enlightenment has never been so effortlessly easy and smooth, courtesy of RISE with SAP, a freshly unveiled business-transformation-as-a-service offering that responds to the need for a simplified, flexible route that suits everyone and is fully accompanied every step of the way.</p>
  <p>This self-styled “concierge service” to the Intelligent Enterprise has managed to blaze new trails by bundling together the requisite tools, guidance, and support systems needed for any company, irrespective of its starting point, to scale.</p>
  <p>Examples now abound of tip-top transitions from all four corners of the planet. One Indian automotive giant with a head count of over 24,000 recently accomplished their metamorphosis to an intelligent enterprise within a mere 17 months, a big brand American retailer of 300,000 in under 10 months, and a British telecom heavyweight in only 16 months.</p>
  <h2 id="in-a-league-of-their-own">In a League of Their Own</h2>
  <p>Software like SAP S/4HANA thus increasingly stands as a critical differentiator in a global marketplace where the competition is narrowing, clarity is in short supply, and opportunities are rife for the taking. Only those endowed with it can keep pace with their peers and their idols, operate at full throttle, and face the future with confidence and poise.</p>

      <div>As any company that is heavily involved in the world of mergers and acquisitions (M&#x26;A) knows, the integration of services, systems, and processes can be make or break. This was exactly the challenge—and opportunity—Umar Farooq, vice president of Information Technology at NexTier and one of the leading minds modernizing IT standards across the energy sector, faced as he took over the lead IT role upon the company’s 2019 formation.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We recently sat down virtually with Farooq to discuss the strategy he’s been executing to grow the energy leader’s business since the merger as well as the role SAP S/4HANA Cloud has played in this process.</p>

  <h2 id="merger-gives-rise-to-new-industry-leader">Merger Gives Rise to New Industry Leader</h2>
  <p>Houston-based well completion and production services company NexTier Oilfield Solutions has quickly become one of the leading providers of such services in the United States. However, in the grand scheme of things, it is still a relatively new company that emerged onto the global energy scene following a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cj-energy-services-and-keane-complete-merger-of-equals-establishing-nextier-oilfield-solutions-a-leader-in-well-completion-and-production-services-300949064.html">2019 merger of long-time leaders Keane Group and C&#x26;J Services</a>. It was important for Farooq and his team to get some early momentum to ensure a strong footing for the company’s future. This is where NexTier’s digital transformation strategy would play a pivotal role, revolving around boosting operational efficiency wherever possible.</p>
  <p>Two examples include the company’s Equipment Health Monitoring and NexHub tools, which help them track activities on the rig site, granting teams a real-time view of operations that enables them to provide centralized monitoring, real-time reporting, and workflow automation—all advancements that are critical in the world of energy production.</p>
  <p>Specific to the merger, one of the biggest value drivers within NexTier’s digital transformation strategy—and one of Farooq’s top priorities—is to manage the technological integration of disparate systems resulting from the merger of two different companies so the team could take advantage of the massive scale, technical expertise, and resources the move opened for the company. Enter SAP S/4HANA.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-s4hana-emerges-as-an-ma-lever">SAP S/4HANA Emerges as an M&#x26;A Lever</h2>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>One beneficial feature of the merger was that SAP ERP was already in use at both companies, so SAP S/4HANA was a natural stepping-stone to help Farooq and his team redesign and simplify business processes. Add this to the oil and gas industry standards SAP has established with the help of leaders like NexTier, and SAP S/4HANA Cloud quickly helped the company unlock millions in merger synergies through reduced costs across IT.</p>
  <p>“SAP S/4HANA allowed us to build an ecosystem of tools that were fit for purpose and aligned with the business. In addition, it helped us reduce our run rate costs for the maintenance of an ERP application,” Farooq said.</p>
  <p>Since implementing the solution, NexTier’s team has seen significant improvements, including a smooth integration with a third-party solution for integrated field ticketing and customer invoicing, more efficient exchange of supply chain partner information, and greater operational and financial visibility thanks to improved data aided by spread-level profitability reporting and increased process discipline. In an industry where margins are everything, SAP S/4HANA has proved to be a valuable tool in Farooq’s overarching and industry-leading digital transformation strategy. But functionality wasn’t the only ingredient for success.</p>
  <h2 id="cios-secret-ingredient-familiarity-with-sap">CIO’s Secret Ingredient: Familiarity with SAP</h2>
  <p>Farooq has gathered many best practices throughout his extensive career, but one element of his background played a particularly important role in ensuring NexTier’s success with SAP S/4HANA Cloud. His first job out of college was with Nissan Motors, where he led the implementation of their SAP-powered vehicle management system.</p>
  <p>“This is where my current role as the leader of technology strategy at NexTier came full circle with the positive career experiences with SAP,” Farooq said. “SAP S/4HANA Cloud became a foundation for NexTier’s ERP system consolidation efforts, and it was thanks to early experiences with the world of SAP that the process has gone smoothly.”</p>
  <p>A certified video game tester and avid reader in his spare time, Farooq has seen tremendous success in his career of helping organizations solve large-scale challenges with technology. When asked what advice he’d give to other aspiring IT leaders, he responded, “The biggest mistake you can make is to shy away from taking calculated risks in your career. You never know when a role you maybe thought wouldn’t be the right fit or a project that you believed might be too challenging uncovers fruitful growth opportunities.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>The pressure on companies to transform is real. However, the answer is not as simple as implementing a modern enterprise resource planning (ERP). Businesses must clearly understand their outcomes to reimagine processes and products based on a strategy focused on delivering and using connected, clean, and consistent data.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Closets. Every living space has one housing a mix of everything from the frequently used, the untouched, and the forgotten. And the only time they are thoroughly cleaned out and reorganized is when the owner decides to move to a new home.</p>
  <p>In many ways, businesses are doing the same by storing <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">more than 200 million new DVDs worth of data each day</a> in their ERP systems that no one will ever see. The technology may provide more tools — such as machine learning-enabled image and pattern recognition — to make sense out of all this information. But the business process layer is also evolving to the point where the entire data stack must be well-coordinated and connected.</p>
  <p>The minute businesses realize that their ERP must be transformed and modernized, their attention turns to the latest applications, capabilities, and processes enabled by intelligent ERP such as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html?btp=344ec6cd-1178-4c78-89c1-0d180d4d53e8">SAP S/4HANA</a>. But very few of them assess their stack to determine which data should be removed or kept. Instead, the great majority fall victim to what I call the data dump syndrome – the wholesale migration of every piece of information into the new ERP environments.</p>

  <h2 id="protecting-erp-transformation-with-a-proper-data-strategy">Protecting ERP Transformation with a Proper Data Strategy</h2>
  <p>In any economic condition, the key to staying competitive is the ability to capture, analyze, understand, and act upon information in real time. According to <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/09/42bcf6df-b17d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">451 Research</a>, this includes recognizing patterns; comprehending ideas; planning, predicting, and problem-solving; identifying actions, and making decisions.</p>
  <p>With the explosion of intelligent devices and digital interfaces creating interconnected ecosystems of people, processes, and systems, businesses have endless possibilities to convert data into insights and experiences augmented by context and machine-enabled intelligence. Despite all this opportunity, <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/02/companies-are-failing-in-their-efforts-to-become-data-driven">69%</a> of companies still fail to realize such an edge to become truly data-driven.</p>
  <p>Before transforming data silos and inefficient processes into a landscape of consistent data management and standardized operations, businesses need a dedicated data strategy to cover three fundamental principles:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Rethink the value of front- and back-office data</strong></p>
  <p>Over half of the companies reported in a study conducted by 451 Research have more than 11 separate repositories of customer data alone dispersed across various applications and organizational groups. And many more structured and unstructured data sources are often linking to that intelligence across both the back and front office.</p>
  <p>Understanding the benefits of consolidating data into a single source usually compels executives to commit to transitioning their legacy ERP to a modern ERP. But such a move does not fix the fact that most of their information may still be left unused or forgotten.</p>
  <p>Evaluating the usefulness of data – individually, by category, and in aggregate – is critical to ensure optimal modern ERP performance. Doing so can amplify the effectiveness of algorithms used to automate processes, executive dashboards that assist decision-making, and collaborative interactions that drive new business opportunities and revenues.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Help ensure the right data is in the right places</strong></p>
  <p>As the volume of available data increases, human-driven analytics becomes ineffective, sluggish, and error-prone. And in response, the ability to map the right data to the right functions in a modern ERP becomes even more essential.</p>
  <p>The critical nature of this part of the data strategy further increases when intelligent technologies – such as machine learning, natural language processing, contextual artificial intelligence – are integrated into the ERP. Adding automated reasoning to dashboards, workflows, processed, and predictive forecasts allows users to make accurate inferences and enrich their analytics profile. It also enables line-of-business users to predict business outcomes such as financial turnover and profit, a customer’s propensity to buy, emerging skill gaps, and supply alternatives.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Build a secure and trustworthy business system</strong></p>
  <p>Unquestionably, effective use of data is an intrinsic part of business success. However, data strategies must also consider how data privacy and protection impacts the trust of people who provide their information willingly and the decision-makers who use it.</p>
  <p>Facing emerging compliance regulations, consumer concerns over the safety of their personal information, and employee expectations for accuracy, the pressure to handle it all is only increasing. Companies that address data privacy and protection during their move to a modern ERP are well-positioned to deliver consumer and employee experiences that are transparent, controlled, and responsive.</p>

  <p>Remember, data is at the core of every customer interaction, organizational process, and employee decision – especially when running based on a modern ERP. And with a comprehensive strategy that addresses the principles of connected, clean, and consistent data, businesses can avoid the data dump syndrome to realize their digital transformation’s full potential.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Zespri International, the world’s largest marketer of kiwifruit, is a longtime SAP customer. Now, the New Zealand-based grower-owned marketer has become one of the first customers globally to utilize the new SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition, launched as part of the <a href="/topics/rise-with-sap">RISE with SAP</a> offering.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The private edition makes it easier and faster for companies running older enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems from SAP to move to the cloud.</p>
  <p>“Zespri is a large and fast-growing business, and we need mature processes and systems to fuel our next stage of growth,” said Zespri Chief Digital Officer Dave Scullin. “Adopting SAP’s standardized core platforms will be transformational in itself, while also letting us leverage SAP’s cloud road map to adopt innovation at speed. Not only will our transformation help us to reduce business risks by moving to standard systems, but it will also enable us to collect and analyze more data, helping us to plan our supply chain more accurately and improve our decision making around shipping and market allocation.”</p>
  <p>“Moving to the cloud has been a key strategic decision for us, providing us with greater flexibility, scalability, and faster innovation cycles,” Scullin shared. “We know SAP’s private cloud capabilities have matured significantly in recent years, particularly in the form of customer flexibility, service level security, and automation, which makes the new private cloud edition best for our business long-term. This will allow us to focus on our process and systems transformation, knowing that our underlying infrastructure and computing platforms are secure, stable, and available.”.</p>
  <p>“Our mission is to create sustainable, long-term value for kiwifruit growers by offering consumers the world’s leading portfolio of branded kiwifruit 12 months of the year.” Scullin explains in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ-tqpYdLzY">the below video</a> that the company chose SAP as its key technology partner in order to standardize and automate processes across the organization, increase efficiency, and provide a platform for growth and innovation.</p>

  <p>The technology will underpin Zespri’s ambitious and multi-year Horizon transformation program, “which will transform the way our company operates, replacing legacy systems and processes that were designed 20 years ago, before the significant growth we’ve experienced in recent years,” said Scullin, a member of Zespri’s leadership team. “It will replace old systems and processes designed for a much smaller, much less complex industry of 20 years ago, which, quite frankly, is holding us back now.”</p>
  <p>Strong demand for Zespri’s premium-quality fruit has seen the industry grow strongly, recording global sales of NZD$3.14 billion in 2019/20.* Longer-term, the industry is forecast to increase global supply of kiwifruit from 164.4 million trays in 2019/20 to around 280 million trays by 2030.</p>
  <p>“We are in a very fortunate position where demand absolutely exceeds supply, and that’s why we have an ambition to grow more kiwifruit in the Northern Hemisphere so that we can attain 365-days-of-the- year shelf space,” Scullin shared. The kiwifruit industry has grown significantly in recent years, buoyed by the increasing trend of more health-conscious consumers looking for products that taste good and are nutritious.**</p>
  <p>“Horizon will release our potential to deliver so much more for our growers and shareholders. It’ll deliver modern systems and processes right across our business from finance and supply chain through to sales, grower, enablement, and engagement and integrated business planning. And it will allow us to be more effective and efficient in how we deliver our product to consumers and return value to growers. Most of all, it will strengthen our ability to grow and sustain returns for the industry for decades to come.”</p>
  <p>Zespri had been running on what Scullin described as “a heavily customized” SAP landscape, but had already moved its legacy systems to Microsoft’s Azure public cloud. After conducting a thorough evaluation as part of its transformation program and some detailed cost versus benefit analysis, Zespri concluded that SAP’s private cloud option was “the best for us and the most strategic long term.”</p>
  <p>While according to Scullin the initial focus of Zespri’s transformation project will be “to get our platforms in place and modernize our base systems and processes,” it will also allow the company to plan its supply chain more accurately and make longer-term predictions. Together with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition, the deal with SAP also includes the implementation of several digital supply chain applications. Zespri also plans to deploy SAP Analytics Cloud and several SAP-endorsed partner solutions.</p>
  <p>The implementation will be conducted by a consortium of partners, including <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/nz/en.html">Deloitte NZ</a> in partnership with <a href="https://www.zag.team/">ZAG</a>, part of Accenture. The project will be split into several phases, with the first digital core build phase due to begin in this month, focused on finance and supply chain processes, before progressing to integrated business planning and sales enablement.</p>
  <p><em>*<a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/zespri/zespri-5-year-outlook-2021.html/full-view.html">Zespri’s 2021 5-Year Outlook Document</a></em><br><em>**In <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264001/worldwide-production-of-fruit-by-variety/">2019</a>, 4.35 million tons of kiwifruit were produced worldwide. This is predicted to reach 5.9 million tons by <a href="https://www.globaltrademag.com/global-kiwi-fruit-market-2019-new-zealand-and-italy-are-the-leading-exporters-of-kiwi-fruits/">2025</a>, as a result of increasing global demand. New Zealand produces around 10% of the total global production of kiwifruit, around 95% of which is <a href="https://freshfacts.co.nz/files/freshfacts-2019.pdf">exported</a>. Kiwifruit exports in 2019 accounted for more than two-thirds of the New Zealand’s fresh fruit exports.</em></p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>As we’ve watched digitalization steadily gathering steam in recent years, with robots popping up in factories everywhere, <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> has put the trend into overdrive. And from everything I have heard, that trend is here to stay.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But what about the realities of all that costly machinery that has been in place since the 1970s? How are manufacturers bringing new technologies into old environments without throwing in the proverbial monkey wrench? How are they protecting their investments?</p>
  <p>I learned the answers in a discussion with Andrea Rösinger and Oliver Hoffmann, co-CEOs of Forcam GmbH, a 20-year-old company headquartered in Germany. Its leading application, <a href="https://www.store.sap.com/apps/59335?source=blog-FORCAM">Forcam Force Edge,</a> helps companies connect “brownfield” machinery with the latest software. In short, Forcam Force Edge collects data “in the edge” – from machinery wherever it’s located – and pushes it via the cloud for aggregation and reporting. The product description on <a href="https://store.sap.com/en/">SAP Store</a> explains it well: “Signals – from machines that were never intended to be digitized to semi-intelligent assets – can be understood, translated, and communicated to the shop and top floor.”</p>
  <div class="promo">

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="digitizing-the-ghost-in-the-machine">Digitizing the Ghost in the Machine</h2>
  <p>The “aha” moment for this invention struck way back in 2001, said Hoffmann, when Forcam’s founder had a brilliant idea. “These monolithic systems don’t focus on modern machines,” he noted, and clearly, that would have to change for companies to move into the next generation of manufacturing. At the time, SAP was revolutionizing the business landscape with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, which could integrate data and systems across organizational boundaries.</p>
  <p>“Before ERP, every plant had different systems without a common database,” Hoffmann explained. “That was the on-premise age, but client/server technology made it possible to connect and standardize even machines of different vintages from different manufacturers.”</p>
  <p>Forcam experienced rapid growth, celebrating its debut and first customer, including global airline and automotive manufacturers. SAP had good market penetration with many of these same companies that were also early adopters of SAP ERP, Hoffmann added. The result was an early, loosely coupled alignment of Forcam with SAP.</p>
  <p>As Forcam’s customers expanded their operations globally, Forcam followed suit, establishing service centers in locations convenient to customers’ plants. Over time, the company has evolved into a comprehensive Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and production control solution provider, with an extensible cloud platform solution running on some 100,000 machines worldwide.</p>
  <p>But the past year has driven an explosion of demand, Rösinger said. One obvious reason is the need to reduce the number of people physically working in a plant; they need a way to access machines remotely and see what’s happening in real time. That is well supported by Forcam Force Edge, which features a role-based interface, whether for the operator on the plant floor or a production manager working from home.</p>
  <h2 id="shifting-expectations-for-plant-managers">Shifting Expectations for Plant Managers</h2>
  <div class="promo">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Other key factors have come into play, Rösinger explained. The pressure is on from CFOs and CIOs to execute processes quickly, switch gears to respond to changes in demand, grease the wheels of the global supply chain, control costs, and boost productivity. Hence, the incentives for plant managers have shifted. Their plant is their own domain, she observed, and their primary mission is to ensure that high-quality products are manufactured on time. End-to-end processes, standardization, and cross-communications across lines of business are not necessarily on their radar screen. “Yet this decentralized model is not practical as digital strategies are introduced,” Rösinger added.</p>
  <p>That’s not to say that Forcam Force Edge is unpopular with plant managers. The app helps production people in the plant with decision-making by collecting and normalizing data from signals on process values such as temperature and quantity count, and writing the parameters of machine controls. It supports all industry communication standards, with plug-in architecture for efficient integration of new standards. And it’s fast to implement.</p>
  <h2 id="cloud-integration-for-data-access-and-insights">Cloud Integration for Data Access and Insights</h2>
  <p>Integration with the SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud solution enables access to all relevant data and insights, not just for in-plant operations but as well for broader managerial use and higher-level improvement processes. And Forcam today has a much closer relationship with SAP that began about a year ago with the arrival of hyperscalers and SAP’s strategic partnership with Microsoft, along with SAP Business Technology Platform. For Forcam, that translates to support for rapid and secure integration with a vast number of machines in plants across distances.</p>
  <p>Now an SAP partner, Forcam is doing brisk business on SAP Store, especially as SAP account execs recommend the solution and send customers to SAP Store to find out more. <a href="https://www.store.sap.com/apps/59335?source=blog-FORCAM">Find out more yourself on SAP Store</a>.</p>

      <div>I’m still buzzing from last week’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> announcement; I firmly believe this new Business Transformation as a Service offering is a going to be a veritable game changer for businesses: bundling products and services to allow customers to start and to progress on their intelligent enterprise journey on their own terms, and at a pace that suits them.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Of course, our market-leading intelligent enterprise resource planning (ERP) <strong>SAP S/4HANA Cloud</strong> is a cornerstone of this offering. Regular product updates serve to provide customers with innovations and enhancements that can be consumed immediately in order to seize new business opportunities, strengthen their market position, streamline operations, and build resilience in more challenging times.</p>
  <p>As the last 12 months have clearly demonstrated, when the world we know is turned on its head, those businesses able to sense changes and identify potentials, able to adapt quickly to unforeseen needs and unfamiliar circumstances are the ones best positioned to emerge strongest from the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Just like previous updates, today’s release of <strong>SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2102</strong> provides customers with new capabilities to further the successful transformation of their business. Short development sprints and continuous delivery coupled with a close relationship with companies in all industries and user groups around the world allow us to prioritize capabilities that we know our customers need <em>now</em> and can benefit from straight away. Allow me to share with you some of the key additions in this latest release.</p>
  <p>A company’s financial operations are like the oil that keeps an engine running smoothly. Particularly in challenging times, a well-managed cash flow is crucial. And in a volatile business environment, companies need to be able to act and adapt swiftly to changing circumstances. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud for finance, we introduce the <strong>simulation cockpit for integrated financial planning</strong>, which allows management and controlling stakeholders to perform what-if analysis and simulate the impact of changes in factors like sales quantity or personnel expenses. A further highlight in the area of finance is the <strong>flexible assignment of accounting principles to ledgers</strong>. In order to run parallel accounting processes in their systems, customers need to use several accounting principles — for example, IFRS and a local accounting principle such as HGB. New customers that use SAP Central Business Configuration to configure their systems can now flexibly assign the accounting principles they require to their respective ledgers. And the best thing: a single configuration is required to assign the ledger to the accounting principle throughout SAP finance applications such as general ledger, treasury, and revenue recognition.</p>
  <p>In recent releases we have focused significant development efforts on building out new capabilities in <strong>solution order management</strong>, which support customers to transform their product to higher-margin solutions comprising complementary products and services. This release sees the introduction of <strong>subscriptions for consumption-based business</strong>, integrating SAP Subscription Billing and allowing users to create subscription services as well as sales and service products in a single order. This facilitates the sale of revenue-boosting bundles of physical products together with one-time, recurring, and consumption-based services.</p>
  <p>Turning our attention to the sales department, I cannot help but think of the old adage “Time is money.” Intelligent automation in the creation of sales orders means a real boost to the efficiency of sales teams. A sales representative who doesn’t have to invest high manual effort into creating orders in the system can already move on to the next sale without delay. The SAP Fiori app in SAP S/4HANA Cloud release 2102 creates <strong>sales orders from unstructured data in PDF files</strong>. After a purchase order file in PDF format is uploaded, the system automatically extracts master data from the file. This data is saved in a sales order request, which can later be converted into a sales order. This user-friendly approach considerably reduces manual — and often error-prone — effort.</p>
  <p>The smart application of <strong>intelligent technologies</strong> is key to any company’s digital transformation. Each update of SAP S/4HANA Cloud brings additional tools to increase the intelligence of your business processes. One highlight in this release is in the use of <strong>machine learning algorithms to provide system support in maintenance notifications</strong>. Maintenance technicians or supervisors can have the system suggest the most likely damage code by automatically analyzing information that is already collected through the maintenance process. This can significantly shorten the time needed to assign the correct damage code to a maintenance notification, speeding up the time to resolution for the customer. It also improves data quality for later breakdown analysis.</p>
  <p>We also continue to grow the intelligence and automation of SAP S/4HANA Cloud through <strong>SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation</strong> – hundreds of predefined bots are available to help drive automation within your business. See the <a href="https://rapid.sap.com/bp/">SAP Best Practices Explorer</a> and the <a href="https://store.irpa.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/order=asc/search=/tag=/type=business_content">SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation bot store</a> for more information.</p>
  <p>This just scratches the surface of the innovations delivered with SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2102. Of course, there are further enhancements across all areas of the product for the benefit of all lines of business.

      <div>If the CEO of <a href="https://www.presize.ai/">Presize</a> has his way, clothing returns will be a relic of the past, and online retail brands will not sacrifice business for the sake of the environment.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The startup’s cloud-based app uses artificial intelligence (AI) to calculate clothing sizes for individual online shoppers. Much more than welcome relief for anyone who has ever hesitated to buy clothing online because they were uncertain of their size, the tool reduces size-related product returns by 50% on average.</p>
  <p>“Sustainability is core to our mission,” said Leon Szeli, co-founder and CEO. “Every product return we save is a win for the consumer, the brand, and the planet. Every item of clothing that consumers scan using our app means fewer returns. This contributes to a lower carbon footprint for the planet, less time wasted for shoppers, and greater cost-savings for retail brands.”</p>

  <p>Based in Germany, Presize serves well-known clothing apparel brands in that country and throughout Western Europe. Its online sizing tool has provided half a million recommendations to delighted consumers. Instead of second-guessing ambiguous size charts, shoppers simply click on the “find my size” button, answer basic questions that include their height, weight, and gender, upload a video of themselves if they choose, and then the algorithm provides their best size for that product. Behind the scenes, AI-fueled algorithms learn from dynamic data analyses.</p>
  <p>“We constantly train the algorithm using data from hundreds of thousands of human shapes and other variables, plus stock-keeping units (SKUs) from clothing manufacturers, and layer that with product return information,” Szeli said. “Once someone saves their size ID, it can be applied to any brand that uses the Presize app, making shopping much easier. Shoppers can even share their size information with family and friends.”</p>
  <p>According to Szeli, online retailers that use the Presize app on their website have increased conversion rates, meaning consumer sales, by up to 25%. As with any AI-based tool, user adoption is critical for calculation accuracy. Szeli said that approximately 10% of shoppers use the tool when it is available on a brand’s site.</p>
  <p>“A big part of sizing uncertainty is the diversity between brands, Szeli explained. “Every product is different, and we want to help consumers regardless of what brand of clothing they buy.”</p>
  <h2 id="digital-insights-for-sustainable-results">Digital Insights for Sustainable Results</h2>
  <p>Presize is the culmination of Szeli’s two major career passions: conducting research and having a positive impact on the world. As a university student in the U.S. and the UK, he focused on human trust in AI-based technology. However, he quickly realized that he wanted to accomplish much more than producing papers for niche audiences. When he met his co-founders, who were working with computer vision and AI, they embarked on a journey to literally change the world – beginning with online shopping.</p>
  <p>“I wanted to do something entrepreneurial that would have a much wider impact and change people’s lives for the better,” Szeli said. “I saw the problem of product returns as a sustainability issue that wasted environmental resources, as well as time and money for businesses and their customers.”</p>

  <p>Szeli valued the insights his team walked away with after participating in the <a href="https://sap.io/foundry-munich/">SAP.iO Foundry Munich accelerator program</a> in fall 2019, particularly around go-to-market and sales practices involving large enterprise customers. He was equally excited about future potential opportunities to integrate Presize capabilities into <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html?btp=6fc61dfd-79ae-4754-9949-16dd49fd1885">SAP S/4HANA</a>, the company’s intelligent suite of enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications.</p>
  <p>“SAP is one of the most successful business to business (B2B) software companies in the world, and learning new ways to market and sell complex software to numerous stakeholders – including how to shorten sales cycles – was the biggest takeaway for us,” Szeli said. “We’re actively exploring how we can continue to work together.”</p>
  <h2 id="sustainability-in-numbers">Sustainability in Numbers</h2>
  <p>The pandemic has only boosted e-commerce. Recent <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US47006420">IDC</a> research found that consumers increased online shopping during the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic by 90%, and that may not be a temporary blip. The same surveyed consumers expected to continue shopping more online post-COVID-19 than pre-pandemic – even more reason to keep digitizing the shopping experience with tools like Presize. In many ways, Szeli sees the opportunity as a numbers game.</p>
  <p>“Product returns are incredibly inefficient, multiplying the monetary and environmental costs of shipping and repackaging,” he said. “Sometimes companies end up throwing away returned clothing because it’s less expensive short term. We want to reach as many brands and their consumers as possible, and we’re aiming to offer people the right size for one billion products by 2023.”</p>
