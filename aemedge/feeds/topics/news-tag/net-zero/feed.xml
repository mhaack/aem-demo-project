      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The world faces increasing climate and social crises. Comprehensive <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/">assessments</a> have given us a deeper understanding of the science and the role of industry. As a global technology company supporting the vast majority of the world’s business, SAP needs to lead from the front with our ambitions and actions. That is why SAP has committed to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2030.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Since 2009, <a href="/2021/10/integrating-climate-action-end-to-end">SAP has been on a sustainability journey</a> with the objective to create positive economic, environmental, and social impact within planetary boundaries. Along the way, we have learned a great deal about measuring economic, social, and environmental performance and integrating sustainability into our business strategy. Central to this effort has been a continuous effort to decarbonize our business. Setting ambitious targets and leveraging digital solutions have proven crucial.</p>
  <p>Raising our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions is a key element of our approach to sustainability, which looks across the interconnected areas of holistic steering and reporting, climate action, the circular economy, and social responsibility.</p>
  <h2 id="what-does-net-zero-mean">What Does Net Zero Mean?</h2>
  <p>Net zero is a state where the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere. Corporate net-zero pledges have gained significant traction as <a href="https://zerotracker.net/">half of the world’s largest companies</a>, representing an annual aggregate revenue of US$27 trillion, are committed to net zero.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="together-we-can-enable-a-future-with-zero-emissions-zero-waste-and-zero-inequality">Together, we can enable a future with zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There are <a href="https://netzeroclimate.org/what-is-net-zero-2/#:~:text=Net%20zero%20refers%20to%20a,the%20need%20for%20net%20zero.">a number of definitions of net zero</a> and how companies can achieve it. SAP follows the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-launches-world-first-net-zero-corporate-standard">Net-Zero Standard</a>, which provides a credible and independent assessment of corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science. The continually improving standard enables companies to align their climate actions with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. SAP became a member of SBTi in 2017 and was the first German company with a science-based carbon reduction target for 2050. In 2019, SAP raised its commitment and adopted a 1.5°C science-based emissions reduction target. We announced our net zero by 2030 ambition in early 2022, bringing this commitment forward by 20 years.</p>
  <p>Achieving net-zero emissions across our entire value chain means that all our emissions across all emission sources need to be either eliminated or, up to certain limits, compensated for. These emission areas, known as scopes, include those from our own operations, those generated by the energy we purchase to run operations, and finally, the largest area, external emissions such as those incurred by employee travel, items procured, and customer data center use.</p>
  <h2 id="targeting-our-entire-value-chain">Targeting Our Entire Value Chain</h2>
  <p>SAP’s net-zero plan is implemented through a comprehensive and integrated approach that involves all functions in the company, customers, suppliers, partners, and other stakeholders. We have established a cross-company program team involving experts from different lines of business to plan and implement our net-zero transformation. Reducing emissions from the use of SAP software will be the primary area for reductions, followed by purchased goods and services. The SAP net zero by 2030 approach includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accelerating the transformation of on-premise customers to the cloud through our market-leading <a href="/2023/07/rise-grow-with-sap-net-zero-journey">RISE with SAP and GROW with SAP offerings</a></li>
    <li>Enhancing direct investments in renewable energy sources and operating our internal and external data centers on 100% renewable electricity</li>
    <li>Reducing emissions by improving the energy efficiency of best-in-class data centers – our own, our co-locations, and hyperscalers – with sustainable programming and a cloud carbon footprint calculator for all SAP cloud solutions</li>
    <li>Strengthening <a href="/2023/07/sap-key-suppliers-reduce-carbon-emissions">engagement with key suppliers</a> to commit to net zero and deliver carbon-neutral products and services</li>
    <li><a href="/2021/11/sap-accelerates-move-to-emission-free-car-fleet">Electrifying the vehicle fleet</a>, promoting green mobility, and enabling hybrid work situations</li>
    <li>Compensating for emissions by investing in <a href="/2023/09/sap-funded-trees-help-reforestation-programs">high-quality, nature-based solutions</a>, such as reforestation, renewable energy, and community development, that have verified environmental and social benefits</li>
    <li>Enabling our customers and partners by adding sustainability features and functions into our core offerings, such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Ariba solutions, and SAP SuccessFactors solutions, and by giving them tools, guidance, and best practices to measure, manage, and reduce their emissions through our <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability.html">portfolio of dedicated sustainability solutions</a> including SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, SAP Sustainability Data Exchange, SAP Sustainability Control Tower, and SAP Responsible Design and Production</li>
    <li>Accurately measuring and reporting emissions using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets initiative and showing progress and performance through platforms such as CDP, EcoVadis, and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="capturing-the-opportunities-of-net-zero">Capturing the Opportunities of Net Zero</h2>
  <p>We have many achievements to build on, but we also are charting new territory. 2030 is not far away. The challenges increase the farther we move upstream and downstream into our value chain. Despite the complexities, there are enormous opportunities ahead as we establish further success with our net-zero efforts.</p>
  <p>From a business perspective, focusing on net zero means reducing risk, improving SAP’s operational efficiency, and delivering cost savings by reducing our energy consumption and waste and optimizing our processes and resources. Net-zero action helps increase our market competitiveness by creating new products and services that meet the growing expectations of customers, partners, and regulators for low-carbon and sustainable solutions. We’ll also be better at attracting and retaining top talent who are increasingly discerning about their employer’s sustainability actions. We’ll offer a compelling case to investors who used focused criteria to inform their holdings. Finally, we’ll continue to enhance <a href="/2024/01/what-industry-analysts-say-about-sap-sustainability">our reputation with industry media and analysts as a leader and innovator in sustainability</a>. And most importantly, we’ll reduce our overall carbon emissions to provide much-needed relief for the over-accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>With an increased sense of urgency, we recognize the responsibility, as well as the opportunity, to step up and drive a faster transformation toward a sustainable future. Not only must we accelerate our own net-zero transformation, but we must help other businesses and industries reinvent themselves as well. Only a fundamental transformation of our global economy will allow us to limit global warming to 1.5°C. It’s vital that we build sustainability into the very nature of how we do business.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Through the <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability.html">SAP Sustainability</a> portfolio, we envision helping our customers and partners become a network of intelligent, sustainable enterprises. We continuously work towards leading by example in our sustainable business practices and are providing products and services that help other companies meet their <a href="/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a> goals. To succeed in our efforts, it is essential to engage employees around the world, build their awareness, understanding, and sustainability action.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The Sustainability Funding Round, hosted by our Chief Sustainability Officer, Daniel Schmid, brings together SAP sustainability leaders from over 60 SAP sites worldwide to promote and finance sustainability initiatives brought forward by the SAP sustainability champions and environmental management system leads. This year’s funding round was dedicated to supporting SAP’s transition to a low-carbon, circular business and saw record-breaking participation.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="together-we-can-enable-a-future-with-zero-emissions-zero-waste-and-zero-inequality">Together, we can enable a future with zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality</h3>
        <p><em><a href="">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>More than 60 proposals were submitted from sustainability champions across the globe, including ideas on improving our physical office environment, enabling employee volunteering, and raising sustainability awareness for zero emissions and zero waste. A jury consisting of experts from Global Real Estate &#x26; Facilities (GRF), Sustainability, Global Sourcing &#x26; Procurement, SAP Corporate Social Responsibility (SAP CSR), Global Communications, and winners of last year’s funding round thoroughly evaluated all submissions. The 25 highest-rated ideas have received funding from sustainability leaders across the globe and are being implemented until the end of the year.</p>
  <p>Here is a look at some of the funding winners.</p>
  <h2 id="2tonnes-immersive-workshop-france">“2tonnes” Immersive Workshop, France</h2>
  <p>What is measured can be managed. Understanding the size of our actions and collective decisions and calling for a lead to action is a good practice. The “<a href="https://en.2tonnes.org/">2tonnes</a>” immersive workshop helps us understand our carbon footprint and how to reach two tons per person by 2050. 2tonnes is a best-of-breed carbon awareness workshop used by the French government. Around 350 SAP employees have already been trained across multiple workshops.</p>
  <p>One of the main challenges was to find like-minded people to take part in the workshops. This was mitigated with the help of leaders motivating their respective teams and adding the workshop as a part of their team activity. The aim is to continue the project in 2024 and train another 500 employees, accounting for 50% of the total number of employees in Levallois, France.</p>
  <h2 id="waterloo-and-montreal-4-trees-canada">Waterloo and Montreal 4 Trees, Canada</h2>
  <p>To foster climate action, contribute to SAP’s goal to plant 21 million trees, improve air quality, protect biodiversity, and support the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration initiative, this initiative focused on planting trees in Montreal and Waterloo, Canada.</p>
  <p>Around 130 native trees were planted in Waterloo in collaboration with Let’s Tree Wilmot, a non-profit organization part of Wilmot Horticulture Society. The project will contribute to community establishment and support reforestation efforts to reestablish a missing forest stratum or prevent erosion due to illicit trial creation. Around 75 trees and shrubs were planted in September in Montreal to enhance Mount Royal, an urban forest at the center of Montreal that is visited by more than 6 million people every year. The project will contribute to the conservation of the mountains and keep the ecosystem strong and resilient.</p>
  <h2 id="green-art-argentina">Green Art, Argentina</h2>
  <p>This project aims to use the circular economy to transform waste into a work of art to show we can add value to things considered unusable. The idea is to work with sustainable artists to create a piece of art using recycled materials that will be displayed permanently at the SAP offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
  <p>The materials will be obtained in a cleanup with employees from Buenos Aires and e-waste from our offices. The project envisions reusing waste, transforming it into art, and spreading awareness about reducing and recycling waste among employees when they take part in waste collection and when they view the art. Employees have already cleaned up a river and have gathered the necessary waste materials for the project. Creating the artwork will start as soon as the artist is onboarded as a supplier.</p>
  <p>The 2023 funding round was a tremendous success and showed that employees from all fields and locations can help lead the way towards zero emissions and zero waste.</p>

      <div>Sustainability is a team sport. No company or organization can do it alone. A vibrant ecosystem is the best approach to enable us all to achieve our sustainability goals.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That is why we’re working with technology companies, leading non-governmental organizations (NGOs), management consulting firms, global systems integrators, sustainability ratings platforms, and standards-setting organizations to understand sustainability business needs and build solutions to support them.</p>
  <p>Through these efforts, SAP is proud to enable many <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability/customer-stories.html">visionary customers</a>, including: <strong>Unilever,</strong> which is innovating the global food system; <strong>Hitachi,</strong> which is scaling the power of renewable energy; <strong>Colgate,</strong> which is investing to reduce waste; and <strong>Anglian Water,</strong> which is rapidly implementing a holistic sustainable business strategy.</p>

  <p>Beyond supporting our customers, we are strengthening our own sustainability commitments. We’ve announced that we will accelerate our goal to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2030, rather than 2050 — achieving our net-zero target 20 years earlier than we originally planned. Our chief sustainability officer <a href="/">explains how we’ve been able to make this commitment</a>. We are also proud to be recognized on the <a href="/2021/12/sap-achieves-top-scores-dow-jones-sustainability-index-and-cdp-carbon-disclosure-project">prestigious CDP A list</a>, which names a select group of companies leading the way to a more sustainable future, and to have earned the top ranking in the S&#x26;P Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) in the software sector for the 15th consecutive year.</p>
  <p>There is no question that accelerated business action toward sustainability will have a dramatic positive impact on people and the planet. At SAP, we believe it is also the greatest economic opportunity of our time. Viewing sustainability as an added cost to business is incorrect; it is a competitive advantage.</p>
  <p>We also understand that business must be both profitable and sustainable. This means putting people, the planet, and profit on equal footing — making the “green line” as important as the top line and the bottom line. Companies that focus on sustainable business performance will gain competitive efficiencies, more easily comply with increasing regulation, and ultimately be able to adapt and thrive through new business opportunities.</p>

  <p>We have learned a great deal through years of focus, investment, and experience working with customers and managing our own sustainability efforts. Urgent action is needed in 2022 and the calls of a “<a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362">code red for humanity</a>” are not overstated. It’s time for every business to act.</p>
  <p>Since there is no such thing as sustainability in a silo, we’re sharing what we have learned. This week we’re releasing a guide outlining Five Actions for Sustainable Business.</p>
  <p>The five actions apply to companies of all sizes, industries, geographies, and stages of becoming a sustainable business. This guide is intended to bind strategy to execution, offering a clear road map to a more sustainable future. If every company took these five actions, we would take major steps forward to enable businesses, industries, and economies to deliver the positive outcomes we urgently need.</p>
  <p><strong>1. Establish a Sustainable Business Strategy</strong> Ensure sustainability is central to your overall business strategy with all corporate functions contributing. Measure your progress and report your annual sustainability outcomes at the same level of importance as your financials.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Embed Sustainable Business Data into Processes and Networks</strong> Use sustainability data within your business processes to make sustainable and profitable decisions and measure performance. Then share the sustainability performance data — which could include calculated carbon emissions, water use, recyclability, or labor information — with your suppliers, industry associations, regulators, and NGOs.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Manage Carbon and Climate Exposure Throughout the Business</strong> Reduce your financial and reputational risks by accounting for and managing climate-related emissions across all parts of your value chain, down to the individual product and service level.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Embrace Circularity and Become Regenerative</strong> Use operating principles to avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle, and reclaim materials to minimize waste and accelerate your adoption of circular economy processes. Go beyond doing “less bad” to adopt approaches to do “more good.”</p>
  <p><strong>5. Prioritize People Across Your Value Chain</strong> Enhance your social sustainability by respecting your workforce diversity, safety, and human rights, developing learning and growth opportunities, and leveraging the power of your corporate purchasing.</p>
  <p>It is important to note the key element that powers all five of these steps: data. The saying “you can’t manage what you can’t measure” applies to revenue, profits, and sustainability. Yet our <a href="https://insights.sap.com/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness/">SAP Insights research</a> shows that 79% of companies report being dissatisfied with the quality of the data they collect about environmental sustainability. The World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/no-1-esg-challenge-data-environmental-social-governance-reporting/">reports just nine percent of companies actively use software</a> that supports data collection, analysis, and reporting on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) actions.</p>
  <p>To facilitate better use of data, today SAP is announcing a new cloud offering to power any organization’s sustainability goals.</p>

    <div>
      <div>SAP has committed to achieve net-zero along our value chain in line with a 1.5°C future in 2030 – 20 years earlier than originally targeted.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Is this too bold? I don’t think so. The recent COP26 climate conference and the Glasgow Climate Pact gave a strong signal to countries and businesses to set more ambitious targets in order to prevent further irreversible damage from climate change. Given the climate and social crisis the world faces, we need to “go big” with our ambitions and have the courage to act, thereby living up to SAP’s purpose to help the world run better and improve people’s lives.</p>
  <p>More than a decade ago, SAP set out on its sustainability journey with the objective to create positive economic, environmental, and social impact within planetary boundaries. Along the way, we have <a href="/2021/07/cfo-sustainability-reporting-esg-metrics-enterprise-software">experienced the benefits as well as the challenges</a> of integrating economic, social, and environmental performance into how we measure and steer our business success holistically. Setting and monitoring ambitious and measurable targets while leveraging digital solutions have proven crucial to decarbonization.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Raising our ambition to get to net-zero is therefore one of the key cornerstones on our path forward to implementing our holistic approach to sustainability, which looks across climate action, the circular economy, social responsibility, holistic steering and reporting, and the many areas of interconnection.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/">2021 Sixth Assessment</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">SAP’s intense engagement on the ground at COP26</a> have left us with a deepened understanding of the science, the role of business, and the impact of SAP. With an increased sense of urgency, we recognize the responsibility, as well as the opportunity, to step up and drive a faster transformation toward a sustainable future.</p>
  <p>Leveraging SAP’s global reach, today we <a href="/">announced the release of SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a> to help companies quickly adopt holistic sustainability management capabilities. In addition, we commit to accelerate SAP’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/purpose-and-sustainability/economics/net-zero-commitment.html">timeline to net-zero</a> from 2050 to 2030 and to reach our climate goals, in line with the Paris Agreement, 20 years earlier.</p>
  <h2 id="what-does-net-zero-mean">What Does Net-Zero Mean?</h2>
  <p>Net-zero is a state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere. It has gained significant traction, with net-zero pledges covering 16% of the global economy in 2019 and recently growing to nearly 80% committed to net-zero by 2050. Because the various definitions of net-zero and how to get there have been growing too, so have criticism and skepticism.</p>
  <p>Leading up to COP26, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-launches-world-first-net-zero-corporate-standard">launched its Net-Zero Standard</a> to provide a credible and independent assessment of corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science, which enables companies to align their near- and long-term climate action with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.</p>
  <p>­­­Building on its <a href="/2021/10/integrating-climate-action-end-to-end">carbon reduction journey since 2009</a>, SAP became a member of SBTi and, in 2017, was the first German company with a science-based carbon reduction target for 2050. In 2019, SAP raised its commitment and adopted a <a href="/2019/07/sap-emissions-reduction-targets">1.5°C science-based emissions reduction target</a>.</p>
  <p>On our pathway toward net-zero, the next intermediate milestone is 2023, when <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">SAP aims to be carbon neutral in its own operations</a> – two years earlier than originally targeted. This includes all direct (Scope 1), indirect (Scope 2), and selected categories of value chain (Scope 3) carbon emissions, such as business flights, employee commuting, and external data centers (co-locations and hyperscalers).</p>
  <p>The potential for decarbonization can be amplified considerably if we enhance our efforts along the entire value chain. In 2020, carbon emissions amounted to 12,300 kt along SAP’s entire value chain (including upstream and downstream emissions) compared to 135 kt net emissions for SAP’s own operations.</p>
  <h2 id="targeting-our-entire-value-chain">Targeting Our Entire Value Chain</h2>
  <p>Reducing emissions from the use of SAP’s sold products will be the primary lever, followed by purchased goods and services. Our focus will be on the following key areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accelerating the transformation of on-premise customers to cloud</li>
    <li>Strengthening engagement with key suppliers to commit to net-zero and deliver products and services on a carbon-neutral basis</li>
    <li>Using best-in-class data centers (our own, our co-locations, and hyperscalers) with sustainable programming and a cloud carbon footprint calculator for all SAP cloud solutions</li>
    <li>Enhancing direct investments in renewable electricity as well as nature-based and technical-based funds to neutralize residual carbon emissions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The next step is to receive external validation by SBTi. We have started setting up a cross-company program involving experts from different lines of business to prepare for our net-zero transformation and will continue to make progress transparent, for example in our annual <a href="http://www.sapintegratedreport.com">Integrated Report</a>.</p>
  <p>We are not starting from scratch. We have many achievements to build on, but we are also charting new territory. 2030 is just nine years away. The challenge will increase the more we move upstream and downstream into our value chain. We will face both synergies as well as additional complexity as we interface with our further focus areas for sustainability, including holistic steering and reporting, circular economy, and social responsibility based on respect for human rights.<br>But as our external sustainability advisory panel confirmed for us, this is the right thing to do. Our net-zero commitment is one of many actions we are taking at SAP. It will take all of us to work together to deliver the outcomes we need for people and planet, and for a profitable, sustainable business.</p>
  <p>As Luka Mucic, CFO, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, and Board sponsor for sustainability at SAP, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRA6IbREmvw">noted at the end of the Sustainable Innovation Forum</a> at COP26: “We must reinvent the global economy. That is what it will take to limit global warming to 1.5℃. All of us must build sustainability into the fabric of how we do business. Only when a business strategy is sustainable itself, and is embedded in all aspects of the business, can we reduce negative impacts and create regenerative systems.”</p>
