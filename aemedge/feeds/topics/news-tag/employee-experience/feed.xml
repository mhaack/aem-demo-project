  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Employee satisfaction is driven by more than paychecks and perks – it’s also about everyday work experiences. One often-overlooked aspect that can significantly impact how employees feel about their workplace is the benefits enrollment experience.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A confusing benefits enrollment experience is a significant source of frustration for many employees and can leave them feeling uncertain about their benefits elections. The majority of employees struggle to understand their benefits options and navigate through the enrollment process.</p>
  <p>As a result, many employees choose to simply roll over their previous year’s elections rather than review and update their choices to ensure they are getting the most out of their benefits. This often leads to missed opportunities to take advantage of lower-cost options or benefits that are a better fit for them and their family and can even lead to increased attrition of top talent.</p>
  <p>With <a href="/2024/04/sap-successfactors-first-half-2024-release">the first half 2024 release</a>, updates to the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-central-hris/features.html#benefits?url_id=ctabutton-us-hcm-EC-freetrial">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Global Benefits</a> solution can enable you to empower your employees to take control of their benefits with an intuitive guided enrollment experience.</p>

Employees can now record time for payroll, as well as against activities and cost objects, from a single time sheet across applications. This helps organizations leverage real-time connectivity between HR and finance operations to keep track of employee activity and labor costs and to pay employees accurately and on time.</p>
  <p>Additionally, a new monthly calendar view for time sheets can give employees and managers a complete picture of recorded time over a month. Users can drill down into specific days and submit or approve time for pay periods beyond a week, such as biweekly or monthly.</p>
  <p>For managers, a new time approval center helps simplify approvals with a centralized dashboard highlighting anomalies for swift resolution. Managers can monitor team working hours effectively, helping to ensure accurate and timely payroll processing.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-successfactors-onboarding">SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding</h2>
  <p>With enhancements to the onboarding journey experience, new hires can now use the new Your Onboarding Checklist page to reference and complete all tasks – onboarding data collection, compliance tasks, additional onboarding tasks, and exploring the onboarding guide – from one place with a single view. Available for new hires, rehires, internal hires, and employees with global assignments, this improved experience can save time for onboarding participants while helping to ensure productivity from the start.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Over the past few years, HR has steadily evolved into one of the most critical functions for any organization. HR not only has a seat at the table, but the ability to become a driving force behind organizational change and growth. Most customers I speak with recognize this opportunity, but many have the same question: how can HR make the most impact?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Each year, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/resources.html">SAP SuccessFactors Growth &#x26; Insights team</a> conducts in-depth research on the latest trends and predictions impacting the HR function. Our PhD-level organizational psychologists and market intelligence experts aggregate and analyze a mountain of HR trends and predictions data to deliver a list of actionable “meta-trends.” For 2024, a list of 611 individual trends were broken down into nine key themes.</p>
  <p>Above all, there is no question that 2024 is the year of <a href="/topics/ai">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>. No longer just hype or speculation, AI is officially here. Exciting possibilities have become realities and organizations must embrace AI or risk being left behind. And while our number one HR trend is AI, you can also see its effects across every trend.</p>
  <p>Below is a snapshot of the top three 2024 HR meta-trends, with examples of how SAP SuccessFactors solutions can help organizations stay ahead of the curve.</p>

  <h2 id="ai-upends-the-world-of-work-as-we-know-it">1. AI Upends the World of Work as We Know It</h2>
  <p>I don’t go a day – or maybe 10 minutes – without a customer asking for all the latest and greatest on AI innovation. That makes sense, as AI has dominated the 2024 trends discourse and it’s increasingly become seen as a way to augment human work.</p>
  <p>Trends indicate that using all forms of AI to improve day-to-day productivity will be top of mind for organizations in 2024. In particular, self-serve AI tools like copilots are poised to increase employee productivity on various day-to-day tasks. As employee sentiment about using AI tools at work has improved, so has the ability of these tools to make employees more efficient and effective.</p>

  <p>HR use cases abound, particularly within talent acquisition, but concerns continue about data privacy, ethics, and regulatory compliance. There’s a lot of noise and movement in the space, and regulators and enforcement agencies are acting quickly to keep up.</p>
  <p>With the tech landscape and market realities in mind, the HR leaders who head AI implementation programs, maintain a strong policy posture, and avoid overhyped or underbaked propositions to take advantage of the most valuable capabilities will steer their organizations down the right AI path.</p>
  <p>Embedding an AI copilot in HR solutions, like <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/ai-joule-product-tour.html">Joule in SAP SuccessFactors solutions</a>, can help employees and managers work faster and smarter by making it easier to find information and complete common HR tasks, such as updating personal data, giving feedback, and initiating a promotion.</p>

  <h2 id="skills-become-the-center-of-hr-practices">2. Skills Become the Center of HR Practices</h2>
  <p>As AI needs rise within organizations, many organizations will need to immediately respond to determine what AI skills are needed, who possesses those skills, and how to fill skill gaps – whether build, borrow, buy, or bot. On the other hand, AI capabilities will also drive the ability for organizations to more effectively engage in strategic workforce planning.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, in today’s increasingly complex business environment, traditional top-down human resources approaches fail to address employees’ increasing expectations for flexible and personalized career development. In 2024, HR will need to meet employees’ growing expectations for bespoke career paths while also solving the broader organization’s growing skills gaps and talent shortages, which present a major concern for leaders.</p>
  <p>Looking forward, it will be interesting to see whether the average organization fully engages in long-term, strategic, skills-based workforce planning, which has long been a strategic objective for many but often remains out of reach as they react to immediate priorities. AI skills could work as a forcing function here – and contribute to other trend areas like learning and employee potential.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/talent-management.html">SAP SuccessFactors solutions for talent management</a> can drive better employee experiences and business outcomes by using a common skills framework across recruiting, learning, performance management, internal mobility, and development.</p>

  <h2 id="hybrid-work-returns-to-the-office">3. Hybrid Work Returns to the Office</h2>
  <p>Looking back at our yearly analyses of HR meta-trends, we saw the hybrid work topic shift from a focus on remote work as a reactive tactic to protect employees’ health and safety in 2020, to a focus on flexibility in 2021, to maintaining productivity and collaboration while working flexibly in 2022, and finally to an emphasis on underlying flexibility and the need for and benefit of malleable guidelines and principles in 2023. With the recent increase in partial and full return-to-office (RTO) policies, 2024 trends data suggests that the pendulum has swung back to hybrid, referring specifically to work location versus a broader perspective centered on flexibility.</p>
  <p>Companies in 2024 will continue to experiment with motivating employees to return to the office in ways that promote productivity, collaboration, and cost savings but don’t alienate their top talent. But some organizations are focusing more on redesigning the nature of work rather than just mandating where or when work gets done.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/core-hr-payroll.html">SAP SuccessFactors solutions for core HR, time, and payroll</a> help employees adopt a hybrid working model by providing options for common HR tasks regardless of when and where they are working, such as clocking in and out via desktop, mobile, or Microsoft Teams.</p>

That’s why savvy organizations are more committed than ever to keeping their sales teams engaged and productive.</div>

  <p>High-performing sales teams are using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/sales-performance-management.html">sales performance management</a> solutions from SAP SuccessFactors to manage and optimize sales compensation and incentives – rewarding sales reps for their performance – while streamlining sales processes and using real-time insights to improve operational efficiency and drive revenue.</p>
  <p>“There’s this renewed emphasis on efficiency,” said Rahul Iyer, general manager, Sales Performance Management, SAP SuccessFactors, speaking to SAP customers at the <a href="https://events.sap.com/us/sap-north-america-spm-customer-summit-2024/en/home">SAP North America Sales Performance Management Customer Summit</a>, held February 13-14, 2024, in Dallas, Texas. “Customers want faster, simpler outcomes – and they want to provide a great seller experience, as well. At SAP SuccessFactors, we’ve threaded the intelligence of connected cloud applications throughout the SPM solution portfolio. This allows us to deliver the efficiency, transparency, and rich experience of SAP in a comprehensive platform that covers a full range of end-to-end processes in sales compensation.”</p>
  <h2 id="together-for-success">Together for Success</h2>
  <p>Under the banner “Together we can make it better,” the summit event provided a venue for SAP customers – some of whom came from as far away as South America – to meet one-on-one with experts and gain valuable knowledge from product road maps, demos, and deep dive sessions, as well as learn from one another’s experiences in customer sessions.</p>
  <p>Iyer affirmed SAP’s commitment to deliver the advanced innovations customers need to be competitive: “As a strategic partner to our customers, we have the moral responsibility to help them receive progressively more out of technology innovations, while accelerating with the best-in-class capabilities SAP has to offer. We are simplifying from every angle to make it easy for our customers to adopt, so they can achieve business outcomes faster.”</p>
  <p>Barbara Rubis Linning, SAP SuccessFactors global vice president, Product and Engineering, presented the latest innovations and features across the sales performance management solution set, which includes <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/incentive-compensation-management.html">SAP SuccessFactors Incentive Management</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/territory-and-quota.html">SAP SuccessFactors Territory and Quota</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/agent-lifecycle-mgmt.html">SAP SuccessFactors Agent Lifecycle Management</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/agent-performance-management.html">SAP SuccessFactors Agent Performance Management</a>. With features like territory planning and incentive compensation, SAP sales performance management solutions enable organizations to optimize their sales performance for better business results. The solutions use advanced features – for tasks such as drive time analysis and mapping to optimize territories – to streamline processes and make workflows easier so that customers realize value faster. The ongoing introduction of the <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-fiori-evolution-horizon-now-generally-available-in-ui-technologies-and/ba-p/13532969">Horizon</a> visual theme on key administrative pages delivers a fresh, modern user interface (UI) for an elevated user experience.</p>
  <p>“We want our customers to have winning sales teams,” said Linning. “Their success is why we continuously look for new ways to build innovations and relevant features into the portfolio to accelerate business outcomes. SAP is building intelligence that is relevant, responsible, and reliable because we believe it leads to smarter, data-driven decision making and results in better sales performance. Our new intuitive UI helps simplify tasks and puts people at the center of business for improved productivity.”</p>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors solutions deliver <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html">Joule</a>, SAP’s natural language processing AI copilot, to help people be more productive in their jobs using SAP business solutions.</p>

  <h2 id="winning-with-sales-compensation">Winning with Sales Compensation</h2>
  <p>As the all-important link between an organization’s products and services and its customers, the sales team is a principal driver of bottom-line growth for the whole organization. Correctly incenting sales teams requires the use of proven strategies and solutions to align the pay program with organizational goals, said David Cichelli, revenue growth advisor at <a href="https://www.alexandergroup.com/">The Alexander Group</a>, who presented “Leading the Sales Design Compensation Project.”</p>
  <p>He advised sales compensation leaders adopt an annual review process that includes assessment, strategic alignment, taskforce design, and comprehensive communication phases. “Sales compensation design needs to reflect the consensus of key stakeholders: sales, finance, product management, and HR,” he said. “By following a proven design process, you can develop a strategically aligned, effective, and motivational pay program.”</p>
  <h2 id="supporting-customer-success-for-better-outcomes">Supporting Customer Success for Better Outcomes</h2>
  <p>The summit showcased the SAP ecosystem with sponsorships and informative sessions from <a href="https://spectrumtek.com/">SpectrumTek</a>, <a href="https://canidium.com/">Canidium</a>, <a href="https://www.opensymmetry.com/">OpenSymmetry</a>, <a href="https://www.cahabaconsultinggroup.com/">Cahaba Consulting Group</a>, <a href="https://www.thelcfirm.com/">The LC Firm</a>, and <a href="https://www.aspiredigital.com/">Aspire Digital</a>.</p>
  <p>SAP experts highlighted SAP’s message of ongoing support for customer success: “We’re here for you,” said Tak Kusano, global chief operating officer of SAP SuccessFactors. “SAP has a tight-knit community of sales performance management experts that bring deep domain knowledge to this niche space. That’s why we’re able to work so closely with customers to gain consensus on the road map and product innovations, like AI. We’re passionate about bringing the best of technology to SAP customers.”</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>People managers have the potential to make or break the employee experience at an organization. They are responsible for understanding the demands of the business and motivating their team members to meet those requirements. However, the people manager role is evolving due to three crucial factors – hybrid and remote work, automation, and elevated employee expectations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To help understand this evolution of the people manager role, the <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/successfactors/growth-insights-research/growth-insights-team">Growth &#x26; Insights team</a> for SAP SuccessFactors hosted interviews with 31 HR leaders from SAP customer organizations and conducted a survey of 731 people managers and 716 individual contributors from around the globe. Based on the research findings, below are six ways organizations can improve current people managers’ performance and experience with SAP SuccessFactors solutions.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="read-the-full-research-report">Read the full research report</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/dg/people-management/index.html">Check it out</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="utilize-co-leadership-models">Utilize Co-Leadership Models</h2>
  <p>Organizations look to people managers to execute important initiatives and people practices, leading to an overload of responsibilities. Implementing co-leadership structures, even for a short period of time, can reduce a people manager’s role overload and provide individual contributors with a valuable experiential learning opportunity.</p>
  <p>One way to provide an experiential opportunity is through <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/05/bc7c3ca3-727e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">dynamic teams</a>, advanced capabilities available as part of SAP SuccessFactors solutions that can help create and manage cross-functional teams that exist beyond traditional hierarchies. <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/05/bc7c3ca3-727e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Statistics</a> reported that 66% of employees who had participated in a dynamic team felt a positive impact on their career, leading to higher engagement. Using dynamic teams can help organizations utilize co-leadership models for projects while also accessing individual contributor potential and incorporating those insights into future succession plans.</p>
  <h2 id="update-people-manager-job-descriptions">Update People Manager Job Descriptions</h2>
  <p>Many organizations have not updated their formal job descriptions for people managers to accurately reflect changes to their roles, leading to unclear performance expectations and ineffective systems for developing and selecting people managers. One way organizations can streamline this process is through <a href="/2023/10/new-sap-successfactors-ai-innovations-successconnect">generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting solution</a>. Hiring managers and recruiters can fine-tune job descriptions with generative AI, which allows them to incorporate supplementary content, identify biased language, and help ensure alignment with business requirements. Instead of starting from scratch every time a new position is created or requirements are updated, recruiters and hiring managers can use AI to help draft job descriptions faster and stay in their normal flow of work. And more importantly, the final content is more meaningful, inclusive, and competitive – presenting a clear and accurate view of the role to attract a larger pool of qualified and interested candidates.</p>
  <h2 id="rethink-career-architecture-and-pathways-to-advancement">Rethink Career Architecture and Pathways to Advancement</h2>
  <p>Without other options for growing, gaining status, or increasing compensation, employees will seek people management roles even if they are not suitable for or interested in this type of role. Developing alternative pathways for advancement, such as specialist career paths, for high-performing individual contributors ensures that employees are entering people manager roles for the right reason – to manage people.</p>
  <p>Sharing career architectures more broadly can also improve managers’ awareness of internal mobility opportunities, which they cited as a top challenge. Talent marketplaces, like the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/opportunity-marketplace.html">SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace</a> solution, can improve visibility into development and growth opportunities within the organization. It can provide AI-driven personalized recommendations for learning, mentors, internal roles, and dynamic teams. This allows employees to have experiential learning opportunities and can provide them alternate career paths.</p>

      </div>

  </div>
  <h2 id="implement-succession-planning-for-all">Implement Succession Planning for All</h2>
  <p>Everyone agrees that people manager roles should become more exclusive, but that also means talent pools will become shallower. Implementing succession planning at all levels of the organization allows organizations to identify “hidden” people manager talent. When developing succession plans, consider that a people manager does not always need to be replaced with an existing people manager – and that a people manager’s next role does not always need to be in management. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/succession-development.html">SAP SuccessFactors Succession &#x26; Development</a> solution can make this process easier by helping employees expand their skills and advance their careers with visibility into continuous development dialogue, mentoring opportunities, and AI-powered career planning. It can also optimize succession planning, making it scalable to place the right people in the right roles and helping to secure the “hidden” people manager talent.</p>
  <h2 id="create-a-community-for-people-managers">Create a Community for People Managers</h2>
  <p>People managers consider staying engaged, feeling included, and managing their well-being to be top challenges. Creating a people manager community provides this crucial workforce segment with social support, which research has shown to be a positive driver of the people manger experience. This also offers the organization a clear channel to host two-way communication with people managers. One way to foster a community for people managers is to leverage the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/workzone-hr.html">SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone</a> solution, which is a personalized digital workspace that helps support and encourage collaboration. People managers can create their own community and connect with each other, allowing for more engagement, sharing of best practices, and improvement in the overall employee experience.</p>
  <h2 id="leverage-technology">Leverage Technology</h2>
  <p><a href="/topics/human-resources">Cloud HR technology</a> can help support the strategies recommended here and solve many of managers’ most pressing challenges. With SAP SuccessFactors solutions, organizations can put their people at the center of everything and create AI-powered experiences that can support current people managers while using talent intelligence to help uncover and develop the managers of tomorrow.</p>
  <p>As the expectations of people managers from both employees and organizations undergo constant evolution, the role of people manager will increasingly become more “people-centric” – focusing on support, fostering development, and nurturing a positive culture. It’s important that organizations use the right HR technology to deliver engaging employee experiences, increase productivity, and drive better business outcomes.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>More than ever, organizations worldwide are seeking to improve employee commutes and transportation with flexible and sustainable options – not only to bring employees back to the office, but to boost employee satisfaction and retention and gain a competitive edge in recruiting new talent.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The HR team at <a href="https://www.degroofpetercam.com/en-be">Bank Degroof Petercam</a> gladly accepted that challenge and raised it, aiming not only to alleviate commuting-associated stress but also to streamline HR processes while incentivizing sustainable transportation alternatives.</p>
  <h2 id="overhauling-employee-transportation-benefits">Overhauling Employee Transportation Benefits</h2>
  <p>With offices in major cities across Belgium and over a thousand employees grappling with a daily commute, Degroof Petercam realized that the bank’s employee transportation benefits needed a significant overhaul. Employees had to choose one mobility plan from limited options and commit to it for four years. The application process was also cumbersome, miring employees and HR staff in time-consuming, manual tasks.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="better-together-customer-conversations-with-bank-degroof-petercam">Better Together: Customer Conversations with Bank Degroof Petercam</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/09/b207b37f-8a7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Watch the video</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Degroof Petercam needed an intuitive, flexible application to maximize employee benefits and meet their commuting preferences while encouraging sustainable commuting and minimizing administrative headaches. The bank reached out to Flexso, whose deep HR business expertise and extensive experience with <a href="/topics/business-technology-platform">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) made it the perfect partner.</p>
  <p>Guy Spitaels, head of HR Service Center, Payroll &#x26; Systems, explained: “We started from a blank page, so it was really important to have a sounding board, and Flexso challenged us in each phase of the project…They really played a critical role.” As for the development process, Bert Van Bree, solution architect at Flexso Digital, said, “I think our approach can be summarized as start with design thinking and then scale with architecture thinking” while remembering that “the application must really empower the employee.”</p>
  <h2 id="meeting-the-personal-needs-of-employees-while-helping-the-planet">Meeting the Personal Needs of Employees While Helping the Planet</h2>
  <p>Flexso’s human-centric approach, combined with the power of SAP BTP, resulted in a new mobility app perfectly tailored for the employees and the business. The user-friendly app gives employees the flexibility to spend their yearly commuting budget on an array of options – public transportation, leasing a traditional or electric bike, leasing a gas-powered, hybrid, or electric car, or any combination of the above.</p>
  <p>For example, an employee might choose to drive on days when they are dropping a child off at school or heading straight to the gym after work and then take public transportation at other times. The app allows users to simulate infinite combinations of different transportation scenarios to create their ideal commute. Degroof Petercam employees value “the transparency and the flexibility of our tool,” Kira Zouboff, HR business analyst, said, and the simulations allow them to “play in the tool. They discover all of its features while they are making their own choices, meeting their personal needs.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To reduce the bank’s overall carbon footprint, the new app awards employees a “green bonus” when they choose more sustainable options, a benefit that has increased Degroof Petercam employees’ sustainable commutes by 50%. “We can incentivize the reduction of our carbon footprint while offering a very flexible solution, and the fact that the tool is consolidating all of the data helps us report on long-term sustainability solutions in line with all of the initiatives that are led by our group sustainability manager,” Zouboff explained.</p>
  <h2 id="efficiency-improvements-for-hr">Efficiency Improvements for HR</h2>
  <p>As for the HR team, the new mobility app automatically assigns each employee’s transportation budget and provides a real-time view of employee choices and requests through the user-friendly administrative platform. After the app’s rollout, Degroof Petercam saw a 75% improvement in efficiency around the administration of mobility benefits.</p>
  <p>The mobility app is also a powerful recruitment tool for like-minded top talent. “I think our large and flexible mobility offer is absolutely an asset in the war for talent,” Spitaels said.</p>

  <h2 id="empowering-employees-by-focusing-on-their-well-being">Empowering Employees by Focusing on Their Well-Being</h2>
  <p>A recent Harvard Business Review article argues that a daily commute is an important ritual that can increase employee well-being and job satisfaction. At Degroof Petercam, current and future employees are empowered to create a daily routine that works for them – walking, biking, driving, public transporting, or carpooling to a perfect day.</p>
