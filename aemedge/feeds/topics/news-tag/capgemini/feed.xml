  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>According to a recent <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/10/92351eae-017e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP and Alpha Sense survey</a>, most businesses have not embedded sustainability into their core strategies. In some cases, corporations see sustainability management as a regulatory and compliance challenge rather than a strategic opportunity for economic and social growth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Therefore, businesses run different technologies and end up operating in silos, which prevent them from connecting financial outcomes with non-financial metrics. Additionally, companies can view sustainability as an after-the-fact reporting activity without any influence in its executive decisions.</p>
  <p>Today, more than ever, businesses need to holistically manage their business models across their supply chains, operations, and people agenda.</p>
  <p>At the recent COP26 climate conference, <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">business and government leaders agreed on the urgency</a> to reinvent their business models to accelerate sustainable business performance. Business leaders want to meet regulatory requirements, improve efficiency in their processes, and create responsible products and services.</p>
  <p>As the leading enterprise resource management company, SAP has committed to help customers in their digital transformation to make sustainability profitable and profitability sustainable.</p>
  <p>In this digital transformation, SAP’s approach is based on providing visibility and transparency to make sustainable decisions from the CEO’s office to the end user, connecting business processes to embed sustainability into all business functions — from carbon accounting to gender equality — and providing a global ecosystem of partners than can help SAP to scale impact through businesses of all sizes and across all industries around the world.</p>
  <p>Providing a global ecosystem to help businesses is core to SAP’s DNA.</p>
  <p>Julia White, chief marketing and solutions officer and member of the Executive Board at SAP SE, points out: “<a href="/">Sustainability is a team sport</a>. No company or organization can do it alone. We work with many of the world’s best companies who support our vision and work together with us every day to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers.”</p>
  <p>Working with SAP, <a href="https://www.sap.com/partner.html">partners</a> advance market development for sustainable solutions. They turn ideas and imperatives into compelling paths to action that leverage SAP solutions. Together, we advocate with thought leadership and galvanize collective efforts and methodologies in industry forums like the World Economic Forum, World Business Council on Sustainable Development, and United Nations Organizations.</p>
  <p>SAP and its ecosystem accelerate sustainable innovation as a central element of the intelligent enterprise. Through co-innovation as well as solution and content partnerships, SAP brings more complete solutions to market faster, benefiting our customers and the planet. More broadly, SAP serves as a key player in a thriving ecosystem of sustainability innovation — helping customers more easily capitalize on emerging solutions that tie closely to their digital core. With its robust network, SAP can deliver a path to sustainability innovation that no other individual competitor can match.</p>

    <div>
      <div>German automotive supplier Brose Fahrzeugteile SE &#x26; Co. KG has co-innovated with Capgemini and SAP on the development of a secure and autonomous self-service supplier portal application in the cloud.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In an era of business disruptions and rapid technology advancements, companies must adopt continuous innovation to stay ahead and win by leading the change. Co-innovation, as a form of inside-out open innovation, has evolved as a way of breaking down the traditional innovation silos.</p>
  <p>At SAP, co-innovation occurs every day in a multitude of ways. We work with partners, customers, universities, governments, standardization groups, and others — all of which contribute to creating sustainable and mutual competitive advantage.</p>
  <p>SAP has embraced an openness within our ecosystem that serves to accelerate the overall innovation process in creating solutions that deliver value. Co-innovation is part of SAP’s DNA.</p>

  <h2 id="handling-a-complex-network-of-suppliers">Handling a Complex Network of Suppliers</h2>
  <p>What does a co-innovation project look like? A collaboration with longtime customer Brose and trusted partner Capgemini offers a perfect — even <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6877628384382394369/">award-worthy</a> — example.</p>
  <p>Looking back at more than 100 years of corporate history, including numerous patent applications, Brose combines tradition with innovation. As the fourth-largest automotive supplier in family ownership, it has established itself as one of the top 40 companies in the industry worldwide, operating 65 locations in 24 countries. With that comes a complex network of suppliers, including more than 2,000 production-relevant suppliers and 8,000 supplier-employees who frequently provide different functional services to different Brose companies.</p>
  <p>With a self-service supplier portal solution, Brose created a space where the digital interaction between suppliers and Brose easily can take place, enabling suppliers to manage their accounts on their own. This way, they can both receive and maintain information and data needed. The supplier portal acts as the single point of contact, providing transparency over supplier users, making collaboration faster and more effective.</p>
  <p>“For me, innovation always starts with a business challenge that needs to be solved,” said Christian Ley, CIO at Brose Fahrzeugteile SE &#x26; Co. KG. “To see what we have achieved now, developing a solution tailored to our needs using state-of-the-art technology, is both exciting and a great example of what is possible through collaboration.”</p>
  <p>Working together with Capgemini, a global leader in consulting, digital transformation, technology, and engineering services – as well as one of SAP’s strategic partners for co-development and co-innovation in the automotive industry – Brose decided to bring the idea to the next level by making it available for other companies, as it addresses an industry-wide challenge.</p>
  <p>“We are delighted to co-innovate together with SAP and Brose in creating Capgemini’s Supplier Integration for Automotive (CSI4Auto),” Josean Mendez, vice president and global SAP partner executive lead at Capgemini, shared. “This solution is an excellent example of what we aspire to achieve in partnering with SAP. This innovative approach is a blueprint for future engagements and adds to SAP and Capgemini’s value in the automotive market.”</p>

  <p>SAP provides infrastructure ready to scale with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP), which supports integration, conversion of data to value, and extensibility for SAP and third-party application and data assets.</p>
  <p>Instead of building a custom development solution from scratch, the development team identified the right blend of services from SAP BTP to solve the problem at hand. The services helped the team to reduce both the development time and the custom software development to a minimum.</p>
  <p>Running in the cloud the application is planned to be part of SAP’s industry cloud solution portfolio, making it easy for future customers to extend their end-to-end processes and adopt at their own pace.</p>
