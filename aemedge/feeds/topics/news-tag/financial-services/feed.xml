      <div>As businesses adapt to digitalization, they encounter various trends reshaping tax compliance. From emerging business models to governments’ digital initiatives, the tax landscape is undergoing significant transformation.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Authorities are starting to involve themselves in business transactions, disrupting well-established business processes and taking control of the invoicing flow between suppliers and buyers. As a result, they have the data needed to prevent tax evasion and start auditing taxpayers automatically or even auto-populating tax returns moving toward tax bills. Additionally, sustainability efforts and climate change regulations further impact tax regulations.</p>
  <p>Amid these shifts, SAP can provide peace of mind to navigate complexities efficiently. By understanding the evolving tax landscape, businesses can leverage SAP solutions to help streamline compliance processes and drive automation to capitalize on emerging opportunities.</p>
  <p>SAP solutions for global tax management are tailored to help address modern tax challenges. <a href="/topics/erp">SAP S/4HANA Cloud</a> can provide transparency and compliance on a global scale, enabling businesses to embed tax requirements in processes.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>What’s News</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>More than 60 central banks are exploring the possibility of launching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
  <p>Among them, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board published a discussion paper on the topic 10 days ago and is inviting public comment on how a CBDC — a digital dollar — might improve the safety and effectiveness of domestic payments.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="saps-take">SAP’s Take</h2>
  <p>As the Fed noted in its invitation for comments, a CBDC could provide a safe, digital payment option for households and businesses as the payments system continues to evolve, and may result in faster payment options between countries. But there may also be downsides, including how to ensure a CBDC would preserve monetary and financial stability as well as complement existing means of payment. Other key policy considerations include how to preserve the privacy of citizens and maintain the ability to combat illicit finance. The Fed’s paper discusses these and other factors in more detail.</p>
  <p>Torsten Hoffmann, chief technology innovation officer for SAP Banking and an expert on CBDCs, cryptocurrencies and other banking issues, notes that CBDCs are quickly gaining traction across the traditional finance landscape.</p>
  <p>Currently, he says, China is actively working on its plan to connect its central bank digital currency to Hong Kong’s Fast Payment system, and Israel is accelerating its study and preparations for the possibility of a digital shekel.</p>
  <p>Indeed Hoffmann believes that the adoption of CBDCs by central banks “has the potential to completely alter the banking landscape,” and that it could result in profound changes not only to the commercial banking system, but also to tax and benefits systems.</p>
  <p>If the central bank becomes of a full-service bank, he says it could be the first step to a central bank digital wallet. Then central banks could provide money directly to people during a crisis — like COVID-19 — and impose limits on what the funds could be used for and dictate how long the funds would be available.</p>
  <p>Similarly, CBDCs could enable central banks to enter the lending business help implement government policy. For example, central banks could help implement a sustainability agenda by only lending to environmentally friendly businesses.</p>
  <p>Hoffmann says the full impact of the introduction of CBDCs will depend on the details. But in the meantime, he notes, bankers appear convinced CBDCs are coming. A recent study from banking security specialist OneSpan found that 84% of banking leaders plan to take steps to prepare for CBDCs over the coming year.</p>

        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced the global launch of SAP Fioneer, a joint venture for the financial services industry (FSI) between SAP and Dediq GmbH.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The launch follows the announcement to establish the company made in April of this year by SAP and Dediq, an entrepreneurial investor focused on information technology and digital businesses. SAP Fioneer expands the financial service software offered by SAP. It also develops new solutions to serve its customers in the rapidly changing banking and insurance industries.</p>
  <p>Today’s go-live of SAP Fioneer marks another important milestone in SAP’s long history of success in the FSI market. More than 800 of the world’s top 1,000 banks and insurance companies are SAP customers. SAP Fioneer focuses fully on accelerated innovation in the area of core banking, core insurance and FSI-specific finance solutions and is mandated to extend the SAP for Banking and SAP for Insurance solution portfolios to cover banking and insurance processes holistically.</p>
  <p>“As in any other industry, companies in financial services need to transform their business to stay ahead of the competition,” said Christian Klein, CEO and Member of the Executive Board, SAP SE. “SAP Fioneer will help them meet their needs for speed, scalability and cost-efficiency through digital business innovation, cloud technology and solutions that cover banking and insurance processes end to end. SAP has a long and successful track record in the financial services industry, and I am convinced that SAP Fioneer will become a leading global provider of financial services software solutions and platforms.”</p>
  <p>SAP Fioneer enables customers to innovate and transform their business by combining premier technology with development expertise and a global network of customers, partners and colleagues. SAP Fioneer will have operations in more than 10 countries in Europe, North and Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region by the end of 2021. SAP will continue to sell and support SAP solutions for enterprise information management and line-of-business solutions to FSI companies, and SAP customers will remain SAP customers.</p>
  <p>“Our customers can expect the same high-quality engagement they are used to, but now also benefit from new capabilities. Solutions of SAP Fioneer will be based on integrated data and allow customers to move FSI processes to SAP Business Technology Platform in the cloud,” said Dirk Kruse, CEO, SAP Fioneer. “We are excited to accelerate the business transformations of our customers with innovative solutions that will be built as part of SAP’s industry cloud solutions, all based on SAP technologies and applications.”</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Hardly any other industry is subject to stricter regulatory requirements than the financial sector. This poses many challenges for providers of financial services that want to migrate their sensitive data and applications to the cloud. To make the journey to the cloud more secure, SAP teamed up with Deutsche Boerse, an international exchange organization and market infrastructure provider, to create a solution: a framework for the secure, compliant hosting of sensitive financial data in the cloud.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Many players in the financial sector are still far from moving to the cloud. As one of the first companies, Deutsche Boerse is deploying this technology by running a multi-cloud strategy and migrating core business processes to the cloud, encouraging innovation and agility.</p>
  <p>“When moving to the cloud, we need IT solutions that give us full control as well as ensure data sovereignty and the protection of sensitive financial data, which is a top priority,” says Dr. Christoph Boehm, CIO, COO, and member of the Executive Board of Deutsche Boerse Group, about the central challenge.</p>
  <p>Without this, the company would not be able to meet the strict regulatory requirements and respond to market changes flexibly. The cloud technology delivers decisive advantages for Deutsche Boerse.</p>
  <p>“Time to market and scalability are crucial factors for financial service providers – and the cloud is the best way to ensure that they’re provided,” says <a href="/author/lukamucic">Luka Mucic</a>, chief financial officer and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “It represents the heart of intelligent technological innovations.”</p>
  <p>The sheer size of the computing and storage capacities combined with the tremendous reliability and agility support moving to the cloud.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="financial-service-providers-aim-for-the-cloud">Financial Service Providers Aim for the Cloud</h2>
  <p>As such, it is understandable that enthusiasm for the cloud is growing in the banking sector, as evidenced in a <a href="https://www.pwc.de/de/finanzdienstleistungen/pwc-cloud-computing-in-the-financial-sector-2021-one-pager.pdf">recent PwC study</a>. According to the study, 78% of German banks are already using cloud services, 25% more than in 2018. And around half of the banks that are not using cloud services now plan to do so in the foreseeable future.</p>
  <p>This comes as no surprise to Karsten Wilop, PwC expert: “Cloud technologies are an essential prerequisite to driving and successfully shaping digital transformation.”</p>
  <p>Although hyperscalers like Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, and others are considered important pioneers of innovation in the financial services area, banks are still very apprehensive. Right now, financial service providers primarily use cloud computing environments to process non-critical data only. According to the PwC study, this is due to high demands for security (82%), fear of compliance violations (53%), and unclear regulatory requirements (49%).</p>
  <p>With its intelligent enterprise strategy, SAP is paving the way to the cloud – and thus to innovation – for financial service providers. Together with Deutsche Boerse, SAP has developed a framework for compliant use of the cloud in the tightly regulated financials domain. It is based on SAP Data Custodian and works to simplify the hosting of sensitive data and SAP workloads in the Google cloud, aiming to help financial service providers drive innovation forward more quickly.</p>
  <p>“This solution lays the foundation for efficient risk management in the cloud – without sacrificing speed or scalability,” says Boehm.</p>
  <p>The SAP Data Custodian solution lets banks decide for themselves which data center they want to use to store and process their data. The application also gives users detailed reports on accessibility and movement of data. Proactive warnings help identify potential security breaches and policy violations quickly, while innovative encryption concepts guarantee maximum data protection.</p>
  <p>“SAP Data Custodian ensures that the cryptographic keys are known only to the financial services provider. The respective hyperscaler has no access to them,” emphasizes Mucic.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Specifically, this means financial service providers can not only have full information as to where their data is stored in the globally connected cloud and who accesses it; they can also benefit from reliable policies for storage management as well as flexible access. As such, the blueprint represents an ideal starting point for the financial sector to move to the cloud. Many companies want to migrate to the cloud or use cloud solutions from SAP but still have concerns about data protection and compliance.</p>
  <p>“SAP Data Custodian gives these companies in particular a level of security that was previously only available in on-premise environments. Our proof of concept with Deutsche Boerse shows that cloud applications can meet even the high compliance requirements of the financial industry,” Mucic says about the value added by this high-performance solution. It can lay the foundation for reliable data security in cloud scenarios and is available for all hyperscalers.</p>
  <p>In the medium term, SAP Data Custodian aims to become the central solution for access transparency and control for cloud solutions in the financial sector — and other industries too.</p>

In this joint session, Boehm and Mucic present the proof of concept in detail and encourage other companies acting in regulated industries that aspire to migrate to the cloud.</div>

      <div><strong><em>ARMONK, N.Y., and WALLDORF</em></strong> — IBM (NYSE: <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&#x26;l=en&#x26;o=3120992-1&#x26;h=446680453&#x26;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3081386-1%26h%3D3322217637%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ibm.com%252Finvestor%26a%3DIBM&#x26;a=IBM">IBM</a>) and <a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that SAP intends to onboard two of SAP’s finance and data management solutions to IBM Cloud for Financial Services to help accelerate IBM cloud adoption within the financial services industry.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The collaboration will be designed to help the companies address the industry’s stringent compliance, security and resiliency requirements, while supporting business transformation and innovation for financial services institutions.</p>
  <p>As banks and insurers balance the need to deliver innovative services and meeting the industry’s strict security and compliance requirements, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/banking-hybrid-multicloud">hybrid cloud environments have become increasingly important</a>. To fuel industry-wide innovation, IBM introduced the IBM Cloud for Financial Services with built-in security and compliance controls that help reduce risk and regulatory barriers impeding IT landscape modernization, transformation and innovation.</p>
  <p>IBM Cloud for Financial Services offers a highly secured, purpose-built environment for financial services institutions to transact with their technology partners and FinTechs.

SAP intends to join IBM’s ecosystem to deliver finance risk, operations and total spend management offerings on the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. The companies intend to help financial institutions benefit from faster business transformation through industry-specific data value offerings and enhanced customer and employee experiences.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Programmable currency is slowly but surely gaining momentum as countries, social media platforms, and now central banks explore ways to digitally mirror cash money in an increasingly tokenized economy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Although we’re far from any kind of standardized digital coin of the global realm, public and private sector organizations are examining the major challenges and closing in on potential opportunities, particularly for B2B transactions across complex supply chains. The appeal to governments and business is strong.</p>
  <p>“There’s a global movement among governments, social media platforms, and central banks to develop digital currencies,” said Peter-Antonius Bramm, global head of Central Banks at SAP. “Private companies see this as a race, whereas central banks and public sector agencies approach this more collaboratively. Each participant has unique objectives, factoring in geopolitical issues, customer monetization objectives, and industry-specific exigencies.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="programmable-money-promises-a-frictionless-payment-future">Programmable Money Promises a Frictionless Payment Future</h2>
  <p>In one scenario, central banks can program digital currency with logic so it can be spent only for a designated purpose. For large companies at the helm of complex supply chains, programmable currency promises the instantaneous delivery of payment upon product receipt. This has tremendous potential for greater business efficiencies, including dramatic reductions in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp-financial-management/accounting-financial-close.html">reconciliation</a> time frames.</p>
  <p>“Programmable money relies on the Internet, making it much easier and accessible to use across previously siloed systems,” said Bramm. “Instead of navigating fragmented organizational and payment provider sites, digital currency would allow frictionless payments at the precise moment goods were received through machine-to-machine payment.”</p>
  <h2 id="machine-to-machine-payments-revolutionize-business">Machine-to-Machine Payments Revolutionize Business</h2>
  <p>Naturally, programmable currency will also transform financial applications software including <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp-financial-management/accounts-receivable-billing.html">accounts payable and receivable</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/supply-chain-management.html">supply chain management</a> and payroll. It’s not just about new efficiencies from merging information directly with processes and payment; machine-to-machine payments herald entirely new business models.</p>
  <p>“When a drone or self-driving electric vehicle delivers packages ordered online, programmable currency could not only immediately transfer payment in real time when the goods are delivered, but also send digital funds to recharge that vehicle for the next delivery,” said Alessandro Gasch, senior product specialist at SAP Innovation Center Potsdam. “The machine-to-machine economy will fundamentally change how business gets done.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Spurred in part by growing competitive threats from sovereign nations intent on global growth, as well as big tech platforms looking to monetize enviable user bases, central banks see programmable money as a viable option.</p>
  <p>“What if you could sell a Eurobond outside the EU jurisdiction and receive Euros in digital currency, which represents real central bank money, constituting a claim against the central bank in the same way as cash?” asked Bramm. “This is one way to simplify correspondent banking and provide the seller with a ‘risk free’ position in central bank money.”</p>
  <h2 id="greater-liquidity-for-company-operations">Greater Liquidity for Company Operations</h2>
  <p>Programmable digital currency could forever alter the role of central banks, providing funds for large companies involved in B2B transactions. Instead of opening a line of credit, companies could use an infusion of digital currency from central banks to increase liquidity, freeing up more working capital to optimize operations.</p>
  <p>“If an organization held the money like cash — even if it’s digital, but it’s millions — they could directly lend funds to supply chain suppliers based on pending and expected orders,” said Bramm. “For trusted suppliers, this would keep business moving, especially in times of uncertainty like the post-pandemic world.”</p>
  <p>Reserve auctions are another potential use case for programmable currency. Rather than bringing a certified bank check to an auction for a big ticket item like a piece of property, a company or individual could use programmable money – from any number of separate accounts – that’s earmarked for the sale and only released from each account via a smart contract when the bidder wins the sale. Once complete, the transaction would automatically be recorded on a blockchain-based distributed ledger connected with the government land registry.</p>
  <h2 id="trusted-digital-payments">Trusted Digital Payments</h2>
  <p>Programmable money is very much so a work in progress. One major ongoing challenge, especially with cross-border payments, is the prevention of money laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing. Central bank digital currency (CBDC) can be programmed with anti-money laundering logic to reduce and mitigate fraud.</p>
  <p>“Whether the digital currency is private or CBDC, it has to have the same price stability and level of trust,” said Bramm. “Trusting an organization like a central bank also means trusting that country’s economy.”</p>
  <p>Bramm expects further decisions from central banks throughout the year. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/08/27/alibaba-tencent-five-others-to-recieve-first-chinese-government-cryptocurrency/?sh=2410f1811a51">China</a> appears to be among the front-runners, likely followed by central banks in Asia, Europe, and Canada. Recently, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) gave the green light to national banks and federal savings associations to hold <a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf">stablecoin reserves</a>. Significant progress will depend on evolving regulations, as well as proven technology scalability. For businesses and consumers, what won’t change is the equation between trust and money, whether it’s digitally programmed or not.</p>

      <div>Over the last decade, <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> has empowered companies to create new business models, control costs, maintain compliance, and enhance customer loyalty. <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> has accelerated this digital transformation journey, forcing companies to ask themselves, “Are our digital initiatives effective and have they been the right ones?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For Northern Trust, the answer to this question is a resounding “yes,” thanks in part to the strong relationship the company has built with SAP to deliver innovative, scalable systems and business-driven content and services.</p>

  <h2 id="northern-trust-market-leading-approach-to-financial-asset-solutions-for-insurance-companies">Northern Trust: Market-Leading Approach to Financial Asset Solutions for Insurance Companies</h2>
  <p>Named the “Best Custodian” by Private Equity Wire in 2020, Northern Trust serves more than 180 insurance clients worldwide with more than US$1 trillion in assets. The company has been providing financial management solutions to insurance companies for more than 90 years.</p>
  <p>Seven years ago, Northern Trust identified the need for an outsourced investment accounting solution in the marketplace that was robust, scalable, and flexible. In the current low interest environment, insurance companies have had to be creative in how they trade and what they trade. Real-time insight across the entire portfolio is critical to business success. Yet Northern Trust’s clients were struggling to have all their assets on a single platform and instead relied on a patchwork of disparate solutions. Others were going through the process of bringing their derivatives in to see a consolidated view of their true holdings and were struggling to understand their accounting.</p>
  <p>Northern Trust sought a cloud-based, agnostic platform that would allow clients to customize their ledgers, support every type of trading option, allow management of all asset classes from privates to derivatives, and accurately represent their position. The right digital solution would need to solve the challenges caused by extracting accounting data, working with data across the globe, and integrating multiple data platforms – all while providing data in real-time.</p>
  <p>SAP Financial Asset Management works to meet these needs and more, providing a one-of-a-kind investment accounting and analytics services application that marries technology and service. Northern Trust considers the application to be the ironclad calculation engine for everything that happens for its clients’ portfolios. By adding the cloud-based engine for investment accounting and analytics, this gives Northern Trust’s clients the ability to truly “interrogate their data” rather than cobbling together Excel files and PDF files.</p>

  <p>Northern Trust started as an SAP customer, operating SAP Financial Asset Management for more than five years before expanding the relationship to help innovate its current business model. Together, the companies work to provide both the market-leading investment accounting platform and robust services. SAP provides the sustainable, scalable application; Northern Trust’s Investment Accounting &#x26; Analytics Service operates on top of SAP Financial Asset Management, providing functional, business-driven content and services to joint customers. It’s a unique relationship that enables exceptional solutions and services to benefit customers that otherwise would not be possible.</p>
  <p>Working together, SAP and Northern Trust offer numerous advantages to insurers, including helping to ensure compliance with statuary reporting for all 50 states and accounting for several bases in parallel, such as US-GAAP and IFRS. The two companies also work to unburden insurers from having to maintain institutional investment management expertise in-house. With Northern Trust’s leadership, insurers can be confident they’re current on rapidly evolving best practices.</p>

        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF and MUNICH</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) and investment company Dediq GmbH today announced that they have agreed to enter into a partnership in the area of financial services.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To better serve the rapidly changing banking and insurance industry, the two companies will jointly expand SAP’s <a href="/topics/financial-services">financial services</a> portfolio with a significant investment in new solutions. These solutions will be based on SAP software and be integrated into SAP’s overall portfolio and product roadmap.</p>
  <p>Pending regulatory approval, SAP and Dediq will form a dedicated Financial Services Industry (FSI) Unit, which will be jointly owned by the two companies. Both SAP and Dediq will provide the FSI Unit with the funding, technology, and development expertise, as well as a broad ecosystem of partners necessary to rapidly establish it as a major force in the FSI IT market. Dediq’s investment in the unit will be more than 500 million Euro.</p>
  <p>“Through partnering with Dediq, we will significantly increase our support for the digital transformation of customers in the Financial Services Industry and deliver innovative cloud solutions at an accelerated pace that help them transform their business holistically,” said Christian Klein, CEO, SAP SE. “Financial services is a key industry for SAP, and today we not only reiterate but also reinforce our commitment to this market.”</p>
  <p>SAP has a long history of success in the FSI market. More than 80% of the top 1,000 banks and insurers are SAP customers. The new FSI Unit will fully focus on accelerated innovation in the area of core banking, core insurance and FSI-specific finance solutions to meet the needs for digital innovation and cost efficiency of financial services customers.</p>
  <p>“The FSI market offers a huge opportunity for us,” said Luka Mucic, Member of the Executive Board, SAP SE. “To unleash this potential, we will use our unique capability to provide enterprise-grade solutions. Jointly, we will extend our existing FSI portfolio to cover banking and insurance processes end to end. Helping our customers to become more agile through digital business innovation and cloud technology will be front and center for our new FSI Unit. The new unit will be very flexible and customer-centric with full autonomy to set its strategic direction. At the same time, it will be a strong member of the SAP family. Customers will benefit from SAP’s leading technology and the FSI Unit’s agility and focus on their specific needs.”</p>
  <p>As part of its industry cloud portfolio strategy to thoroughly serve its 25 industries with tailored solutions, SAP has forged a number of partnerships. This latest one with Dediq marks a further milestone in the implementation of this strategy. SAP customers can expect the same high-quality engagement, with new capabilities now made possible by the new FSI Unit. The new solutions will cover the full cycle of banking and insurance operations processes, and help meet regulatory requirements. They will be based on integrated data and provide an opportunity to move FSI processes to the SAP Business Technology Platform in the cloud. For example, lending solutions for banks will cover all stages from origination and credit risk assessment to re-financing and bank management, with all related data kept in one place. This will significantly reduce IT cost and complexity.</p>
  <p>“We strongly believe in the strategy of the new FSI Unit,” said Matthias Tomann, Managing Partner, Dediq. “We see the future of FSI software solutions in the cloud. SAP’s platform has unrivalled potential when it comes to supporting the core operations of large-scale businesses like banks and insurers as well as new emerging ecosystems. Making this vision a reality in financial services is highly exciting to us.”</p>
  <p>SAP will continue to sell and support SAP solutions for enterprise information management and line-of-business solutions and SAP customers will remain SAP customers. The new FSI Unit will focus its investment on core FSI areas such as commercial lending, retail banking, core insurance as well as insurance finance and bank management. The new solutions will be built as part of SAP’s industry cloud solutions, based on SAP technologies and applications such as SAP HANA, SAP S/4HANA, SAP Business Technology Platform and others.</p>
  <p>“Today’s financial services industry is challenged to balance agility and innovation with risk, resiliency and scale. With this announcement, SAP is responding to the needs of its clients to improve speed of innovation while continuing to provide enterprise-class and mission-critical products and services to the industry,” said Jerry Silva, vice president of IDC Financial Insights.</p>
  <p>Pending antitrust approval, the new FSI Unit is expected to be in place in the second half of 2021. Corresponding preparations are scheduled to start in the coming weeks.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that it took first place in both core banking/back-end systems and accounting and treasury management in the Fintech Leaders 2021 Report by the Center for Financial Professionals (CeFPro), an international research organization. CeFPro also named <a href="https://www.sap.com/industries/banking.html?infl=078fcbaf-dfa2-48c5-b524-b0872eeab725">SAP</a> among the top 20 in the overall fintech ecosystem.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <p>The rankings categorize and evaluate leading fintech companies, vendors and solution providers and are based on data gathered from surveys of practitioners, end users and subject matter experts. The report uses original research and market analysis conducted by CeFPro and backed by an advisory board of 60 international industry professionals.</p>
  <p>“SAP’s inclusion in our global Fintech Leaders 2021 Report is recognition of the great work that SAP is undertaking,” CeFPro Managing Director Andreas Simou said. “The votes cast by the industry in the survey, voting SAP best in accounting and treasury and also in core banking categories, also helped propel their overall position in the ecosystem by several places in the top 20.”</p>
  <p>CeFPro’s Fintech Leaders 2021 Report also includes research on industry trends, priorities and challenges. Key findings highlight advanced analytics and artificial intelligence as leading opportunities. These takeaways underscore the importance of making technology the backbone of fintech strategies for a state-of-the-art <a href="https://www.sap.com/industries/banking.html">intelligent suite and digital platform</a>.</p>
  <p>“We are honored to receive in back-to-back years this prestigious award in the categories of core banking, and accounting and treasury,” SAP Global Head of Banking Falk Rieker said. “It is an acknowledgement of our industry thought leadership, our industry cloud strategy and our focus on delivering new and innovative industry solutions and capabilities that make a difference to our customers.”</p>
