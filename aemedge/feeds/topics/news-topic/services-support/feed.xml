  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>On April 1, 2024, SAP <a href="/2024/04/cloud-transformation-adoption-revolution-expectations-outcomes-meet">formed</a> Customer Services &#x26; Delivery – a new Board area that will focus on maximizing innovation adoption and customer value in the cloud.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is good news – not just for customers but also for the ecosystem. In recent months, SAP had already identified that when engineering teams deliver innovations, there is a corresponding need to provide customers with guidance on how they can swiftly adopt and consume innovation. Customer Services &#x26; Delivery was created to bring together the offerings that help customers tap the value of SAP’s integrated portfolio.</p>
  <p>By virtue of its function, the Customer Support organization fits into this strategic setup quite naturally. To learn more about how Customer Support is owning and driving end-to-end customer support experiences powered by AI, I met with Stefan Steinle, executive vice president and head of Customer Support, SAP SE.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: How would you describe the role of Customer Support in SAP’s success?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Customer support is a differentiating factor among companies that are equally positioned in functional richness, usability, quality, deployability, or configurability. While signing up a new customer is considered a huge win, being able to delight and retain the customer is equally important.</p>
  <p><a href="https://support.sap.com/en/index.html">Support at SAP</a> has been singularly impactful in advancing SAP’s customer success stories by proactively responding to customer needs and building long-term relationships. In addition to helping customers solve day-to-day problems, we are business partners who proactively work with customers toward achieving their business goals.</p>
  <p>The Customer Support group encompasses much more than bug fixes. In addition to regular ticket resolutions, we use SAP Cloud ALM to help guide customers in application lifecycle management by enabling their transformation to the cloud and the operation of hybrid environments. We help customers help themselves through self-services and we proactively consult with our engineering teams to improve SAP products based on support-related feedback and learnings. Thanks to our support engineers, SAP has delivered over 1,000 improvements in the last 12 months.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: How is SAP’s AI story shaping up when it comes to Customer Support? What is the AI strategy for Customer Support?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> With our focus on value realization, the push to enhance support with AI has never been higher. To start with, we have invested in digitalizing mission-critical business processes with AI.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="revolutionize-your-business-with-generative-ai-innovations-from-sap">Revolutionize your business with generative AI innovations from SAP</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There are three parts toward bringing these business processes into the fold of AI-powered offerings. With the help of SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite, we can measure metrics around the customer’s business processes to gauge efficiency, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement. Alternatively, customers can use this as a blueprint to review these metrics themselves. The next layer delivers business transformational AI services. And finally, we have a platform that provides tools to support a closed-loop approach for AI innovation in services and support.</p>
  <p>Coming to the AI strategy for Customer Support, we believe that any innovations in AI must be in lockstep with application integration, meaning AI developments can only bring business value when they are infused and integrated into the applications used in a business process or scenario.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: In the context of Customer Support, could you give some examples of how AI brings business value?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> While the real-world applications are countless, we could broadly classify them into three groups.</p>
  <p>We use AI to correct – this means we use AI for the support experience, for personalization, and for data-driven decisions. We use AI to connect – here you find the platform, tools, and applications along customer touchpoints. We use AI to catalyze – this covers self-service, issue resolutions, and predictive and preventative support.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: How does SAP realize this?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> We do this by taking advantage of our AI development platform that can bring all the data of services and support into one place. This platform helps bring endless possibilities based on the unique needs of customers’ businesses. On our part, we ensure that we explore the power of AI across business contexts.</p>
  <p>By building AI models, we have the power to transform business in the way we want. We can plug these models into support systems and portals to extract the full value of AI in support. By collecting data and events from support systems and portals, we can even train AI models that can deliver value later. By processing the context and history of the customer, we can provide highly personalized support experiences – at runtime.</p>
  <p>I could go on, but at this point I would urge you to follow the Customer Support tracks at <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/sapphire.html">SAP Sapphire &#x26; ASUG Annual Conference Orlando on June 3–5, 2024</a>, to learn about the technologies and strategies that are shaping the future of Customer Support and business transformation.

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The Support Accreditation course offered by SAP plays a vital role in educating partners, customers, and internal employees about <a href="/topics/support">SAP’s support services</a>. In this interview, Simone Engelhardt, SVP and head of Customer Engagement Support for Customer Services &#x26; Delivery at SAP, discusses the importance of support channels, the 24/7 support structure, service continuity, and best practices for interacting effectively with SAP support teams.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Feedback from participants highlights the training’s success in improving the understanding and utilization of support services. Ongoing updates help ensure the course remains relevant amidst evolving technology and business landscapes, with future developments likely to incorporate advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools for support services.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: Can you provide an overview of the Support Accreditation training and its significance for anyone engaging with SAP’s support processes?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Engelhardt:</strong> The Support Accreditation is a vital learning tool for our partners and customers as well as for our employees. It’s an informative course that can familiarize participants with SAP support services and help maximize their support experience. This is a unique opportunity to understand all the tools and resources available when interacting with SAP support and to learn efficient ways of engaging with our teams and resolving issues.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>In situations of urgency or escalation, customers might try to contact someone at SAP they personally know rather than follow the regular process. How does Support Accreditation address such situations and educate participants on the importance of following the proper channels?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That’s a great point. In urgent or escalated situations, individuals might feel tempted to bypass the usual channels and seek immediate remedies. However, these uninformed measures can result in delays. The Support Accreditation course emphasizes following the correct SAP support processes, which can ensure their issues are routed to the appropriately skilled support teams, leading to more efficient problem resolution.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Can you shed light on how the Support Accreditation training details the importance of our 24/7 support structure and how customers and partners can take advantage of it?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The course thoroughly details our 24/7 support structure. We work to ensure that participants understand how, no matter their time zone, they can harness this around-the-clock support. It’s about making sure that our customers and partners know that they always have the backing of SAP, no matter when an issue arises.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>How can customers and partners ensure that their issues are addressed efficiently even when their primary contacts at SAP are out of office?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We indeed cover this crucial aspect. The training delves into detail about the Customer Support organization, which aims to ensure service continuity even if specific account contacts at SAP are unavailable. Our course participants are made aware of the various support structures in place to assist them.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>The Support Accreditation training also covers the etiquette and best practices for interacting with SAP support. Can you talk more about this and why it’s important?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Interacting with support teams forms a large part of managing SAP services, so etiquette and best practices in this area are covered in our course. We guide learners on the most effective ways to communicate with our teams, provide necessary information, and follow prescribed processes for optimal support assistance.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Do you have any insights related to the feedback from Support Accreditation participants? How has the course improved their understanding and utilization of our support services?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Feedback from Support Accreditation participants has been overwhelmingly positive. Our learners report significantly improved knowledge about SAP support services and tools, and they’ve been successful in applying this knowledge to engage more effectively with SAP support. This has resulted in smoother, quicker issue resolutions, translating to improved satisfaction and service experiences.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>With technology and business requirements evolving, how will the Support Accreditation course adapt to these changes? What future developments can participants expect?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The course isn’t static; it evolves with the technology landscape and business requirements. We continually update it to include new tools, offerings, or changes to existing processes. This helps ensure that the Support Accreditation training remains up-to-date and continues to be a valuable resource for our customers and partners. Future developments will certainly involve advancements in AI and machine learning tools in support services, so participants can be well prepared for the future of support services.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>A company’s established culture is usually a greater obstacle on the way to the cloud than technical issues. That’s why SAP supports its cloud customers with customer success partners that help make sure business objectives are achieved on the journey to the cloud.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The ability to innovate is a <a href="https://pub.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/innovative-milieus/ergebnisse-zugespitzt">key part of business success</a>. Yet companies also have to be able to transform market innovations into value for their customers if they want to stay ahead of the competition. It is hard to imagine attaining this kind of performance today without cloud computing. <a href="https://cloud.ionos.de/reports/idc-cloud-deutschland-2023">Analysts hold the cloud</a> to be one of the most effective tools of the digital age on the way to becoming an agile, highly innovative, competitive company. SAP has systematically embraced this technology since 2020 and is currently realigning its own organization to become a cloud provider. In my experience, it has become evident that the cloud is the only way to add value quickly at a manageable level of cost and effort.</p>
  <p>Cloud computing is disruptive, however, and demands enormous changes. SAP users, for example, also have to switch to the new architecture of the SAP portfolio, with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> as the digital core, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)</a> as the new environment for innovation and customer enhancements, and the <a href="https://www.signavio.com/">SAP Signavio</a> portfolio as the foundation for more efficient business processes.</p>
  <h2 id="overcome-mental-barriers-to-cloud-transformation-with-customer-success-partner">Overcome Mental Barriers to Cloud Transformation with Customer Success Partner</h2>
  <p>“The paradigm shift in IT to cloud computing has changed everything, especially the way I provide and deploy software at companies today,” explains Alexander Michnov, head of Strategic Sales, RISE with SAP, at SAP. To better support customers in this dynamic situation, SAP established the post-sales unit Customer Success Partner team in early 2022. Our role at SAP is to understand the business objectives our customers are pursuing in a cloud transformation context and helping to ensure they actually achieve them, above and beyond the technological implementation.</p>
  <p>According to SAP experts, the greatest obstacle to fully capturing the benefits of the cloud – such as faster time to market and simple use of resource-intensive high-tech – is an outdated process mindset. Therefore, a cloud transformation must focus on holistic changes to the corporate culture and business processes, not only on the technology.</p>
  <h2 id="smooth-transition-from-contract-signing-to-implementation">Smooth Transition from Contract Signing to Implementation</h2>
  <p>This change process is where the Customer Success Partner team comes in, assigning a customer success partner to every RISE with SAP customer as a complement to the SAP implementation partner. When an SAP customer starts a cloud migration project, they set off on a journey that can fundamentally change their organization – from their business processes to the way their employees collaborate with each other.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="tap-into-personalized-resources-and-on-demand-sap-experts-ready-to-help-you-realize-success">Tap into personalized resources and on-demand SAP experts ready to help you realize success</h3>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>First, the customer success partner works with the customer to determine the business objectives. This is followed by developing a road map that defines what needs to be done for the customer to achieve these objectives soundly. In the early phase of a transformation project, the customer success partner also helps ensure that the transition from contract signing to the actual implementation phase goes smoothly. This transition is the first critical element. The customer success partner helps make sure that all the aspects needed to add value early on – maintaining a clean core first and foremost, ensuring that training schedules have been developed, and confirming the customer has the right contact person if they change their mind on a specific process, for instance – are taken into account from day one.</p>
  <h2 id="looking-back-and-looking-forward-in-the-post-go-live-phase">Looking Back and Looking Forward in the Post-Go-Live Phase</h2>
  <p>The next critical phase begins when the technical implementation is complete. This is usually when tensions start to ease after the exciting go-live phase. But it is especially important at this stage to ensure users use the system in the intended manner, no communication gaps have arisen, and people do not lose focus. That’s also the perfect time to start the evaluation. Have the business objectives been achieved? Has the initial problem that triggered the implementation been solved? And, of course, this is a great time to discuss the next wave of innovation with the customer.</p>
  <h2 id="key-factors-of-a-customer-success-partner">Key Factors of a Customer Success Partner</h2>
  <p>Here are three key factors for a customer success partner’s work from the customer perspective:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Early involvement of the customer success partner, ideally during the sales process, to help define the expected added value of the project</li>
    <li>Organizational networking of the customer success partner in the organizations of the customer, the implementation partner, and SAP</li>
    <li>The customer success partner’s ability to harmonize the customer’s road map with SAP’s strategy – for the customer, it’s extraordinarily valuable to have a counterpart with whom they can discuss SAP’s strategic direction and planned innovations in day-to-day business</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As such, the customer success partner represents an ideal complement to the SAP implementation partner. The latter still bears overall responsibility for the system changeover during the entire transition process. In contrast, the customer success partner helps make sure that everything necessary is done so the implementation corresponds to the value targets defined in the beginning. They help ensure that all the aspects strategically important to the customer and SAP – starting with a clean core – are taken into account throughout the course of the project.</p>
  <h2 id="the-value-of-long-term-relationships">The Value of Long-Term Relationships</h2>
  <p>“The customer success partner is the guardian of the clean core and customer lifetime value,” summarizes Michnov, bringing a further dimension of the new post-sales organization into play. In the new cloud world, innovations and enhancements take place continuously and become available to customers extremely quickly, thanks to short release cycles.</p>
  <p>Cloud migration is like a journey from one milestone to the next. In this world, the commitment never really ends; it’s a world of long-term relationships. As such, my team’s mission is to support customers from day one and in perpetuity. The customer success partner enters a lifelong commitment with the customer. The customer success partner is there before the implementation, they are there after the implementation, and they are there even when no implementation is needed at all.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Consumer product companies and grocery retailers have leveraged the power of promotions for decades, attracting consumers and building enduring relationships with them. The approach encompasses various marketing strategies that retailers and consumer product companies employ to boost sales volume and overall turnover. A variety of tactics are leveraged, such as product and packaging modifications, advertising initiatives, alterations in product placement, and other point-of-sale (POS) campaigns.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But when costs and inflation increase, such promotions become particularly valuable, relieving consumers’ wallets while maintaining competitiveness and fostering lasting customer loyalty. The approach is then narrowed down to short-term price reductions – where regular shelf prices of selected items or entire shopping baskets are significantly marked down for a predefined campaign period complemented by extensive advertising.</p>
  <h2 id="understand-the-true-purpose-and-impact">Understand the True Purpose and Impact</h2>
  <p>Thanks to product designers and managers in the <a href="/topics/consumer-products">consumer products industry</a> and those responsible for grocery retail marketing, many different promotion types have emerged in recent years. Even though there is a high number of variants and different mixed forms, promotions can be broadly categorized into three main types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Filling up (household) stock</strong> encourages higher-than-normal purchase quantities for each shopping trip by offering multipacks, product bundles, larger packaging sizes, and refills.</li>
    <li><strong>First-time purchases</strong> compel consumers to try new or alternative products with trial sizes that feature smaller quantities than the standard product.</li>
    <li><strong>Traditional price-off offers</strong> promote a standard size product at a discounted price for a specific period with the support of a marketing campaign. They can be combined with other promotion types, including product bundles and multipacks.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="close-interactions-and-dependencies">Close Interactions and Dependencies</h2>
  <p>If you look at the range of products advertised through promotions, it’s clear that branded products dominate leaflets, online offers, and flyers distributed by large grocery retail chains. In fact, the proportion of promotions with branded products often reaches 90% or more in many established markets.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="orchestrate-your-omnichannel-shopping-experience-with-sap">Orchestrate your omnichannel shopping experience with SAP</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/customer-activity-repository.html">Find out how</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Considering these factors, consumer goods companies and grocery retailers must cooperate up to a certain level. Grocery retailers benefit from established brands because they can help ensure a broad group of consumers will notice the advertising and perceive promotional items as attractive. Consumer products companies, in turn, need grocery retailers to place new products at the point of sale and secure a competitive position for their core brands.</p>
  <p>Although both consumer goods companies and grocery retailers are interested in the success of jointly planned promotions, their actual objectives differ significantly. While retail companies are primarily running promotional campaigns to increase visit or purchase frequency and optimize cross-selling initiatives, consumer goods producers usually view expanding or securing market share as their primary goal.</p>
  <h2 id="acknowledge-the-importance-of-technology">Acknowledge the Importance of Technology</h2>
  <p>Given the critical nature of promotions, the right technology can help consumer products companies and grocery retailers realize mutually beneficial and optimized outcomes to increase their share of wallet, margin, and overall revenue. For example, technology can help streamline the promotion process, improve planning and execution, and measure campaign effectiveness.</p>
  <p>Working with leading consumer products companies and grocery retailers worldwide, SAP developed and continues to update a portfolio of solutions that can address market requirements, business challenges, and ever-evolving needs and expectations.</p>
  <h2 id="price-promotions-solutions-for-grocery-retail">Price Promotions Solutions for Grocery Retail</h2>
  <p>Retailers using SAP solutions are well-equipped to be able to address complex challenges in the promotion management process. They can increase inventory turnover and reduce food waste by leveraging real-time, data-driven insights into the evolving market landscape, supporting the promotion process, and driving smooth, error-free interactions.</p>

  </div>
  <p>With the SAP Promotion Management application, which is part of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/customer-activity-repository.html">SAP Customer Activity Repository</a>, retailers can plan, manage, and analyze their promotional events. The application helps streamline their promotion processes, access real-time data, and accurately evaluate results. In addition, it can gather data and integrate with the demand data foundation module of SAP Customer Activity Repository to help drive data integrity across multiple applications.</p>
  <p>Retailers can use enhanced planning capabilities from SAP Customer Activity Repository to help optimize promotion effectiveness and profitability. They can create coupons, define promotional advertising vehicles, specify promotional offers by location and language, and manage promotions by type, tactic, and incentives. Furthermore, they can exchange data across various SAP applications and support what-if simulations to help identify scenarios predicted to yield the best financial performance.</p>
  <p>Additional capabilities that further complement the promotion process in grocery retail include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Omnichannel price and promotion service</strong> that can enable retailers to enhance the shopping experience with consistent pricing across all sales channels.</li>
    <li><strong>Retail promotion analytics</strong> that can provide valuable data-driven insights to help guide future decision-making and promotion optimization strategies.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="price-promotions-solutions-for-consumer-products-companies">Price Promotions Solutions for Consumer Products Companies</h2>
  <p>For consumer products companies, SAP solutions help support promotion management and trade spend, which, in total, comprise the majority of business revenue. They can provide a tailored approach to promotion planning, execution, and control – enabling increased focus on revenue, volume, and profitability for themselves and their retail partners. Modern analytics capabilities are also included, such as statistical forecasting, optimization, post-evaluation, and innovative machine learning tools.</p>
  <p>Take, for example, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/trade-management.html">SAP Trade Management</a> solution. It can facilitate the design of promotional plans, fund management, and claims settlement while offering performance analysis to help gauge the effectiveness of trade promotions.</p>
  <p>The solution can allow businesses to shift their focus from short-term measures of promotion effectiveness to longer-term, mutually defined targets, including category growth, sustainable volume growth, and margin growth. Additionally, it can empower sales leaders to sense and predict potential risks to revenue, volume, and profitability in real time, align their strategies with retailers’ broader business objectives, and make fact-based decisions for activities best aligned with targets.</p>
  <h2 id="unlock-the-full-potential-of-every-promotion">Unlock the Full Potential of Every Promotion</h2>
  <p>In today’s competitive landscape, the ability to decode and master promotions is a strategic imperative. With the right technology and solutions in place, consumer product companies and grocery retailers can unlock the full potential of their promotions, driving revenue, enhancing margins, and securing their place in the market.</p>

    <div>
      <div>The past few years have been marked by a profound shift in the concept of “business transformation.” From recent AI advancements to cloud-centric innovations, the boundaries between adapting to change and shaping conditions that radically impact people’s lives for the better are blurring – driving ongoing growth and prosperity.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Many SAP customers are at the forefront of this new era of business transformation, relying on the guidance and expertise offered through <a href="https://www.sap.com/services-support/service-offerings/preferred-success.html">SAP Preferred Success</a>. They are mapping out new strategies and developing unique solutions that not only scale up their digital capabilities but also accelerate growth in more relevant, responsible, and self-differentiating ways.</p>

      </div>

  </div>
  <p>Here is my overview of some of these game-changing transformation successes.</p>
  <h2 id="supporting-citizens-with-integrated-solutions">Supporting Citizens with Integrated Solutions</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2022/12/101267bd-537e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">The City of Hamburg</a> leveraged the intuitive self-service capabilities of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> to build on its advanced IT infrastructure to support a digitalized aid-application process – from initial requests, validity checks, and objection handling to payment.</p>
  <p>The new aid platform was developed in a hybrid landscape as a side-by-side extension, which enabled a speedy implementation of only three weeks. SAP Preferred Success and SAP Innovation Services offerings were employed for expertise in architecture design and project implementation and management. The city also gained assistance from external partners Dataport and D-Labs to coordinate the back-end integration – running the solution, providing technical support, and building the portal user experience, respectively.</p>
  <p>Backing more than 1 million registered cultural events, the platform has the flexibility and scalability to change with the government authority’s technical footprint as needs evolve. AI-based decision support makes the process manageable for a limited workforce. Furthermore, live reporting gives essential, real-time information, such as requested budget amounts and application status, to state authorities and the federal government.</p>
  <p>On the social side, the real-time distribution of financial aid allows Hamburg’s cultural industry to thrive, enabling events to occur with reduced capacities and elevating confidence in event planning. Overall, the project’s success is serving as a best-practice model for helping people in need in other sectors or situations in the future quickly and reliably.</p>
  <h2 id="expanding-global-reach-through-a-unified-platform">Expanding Global Reach Through a Unified Platform</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/07/ee2a3fca-817e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Lenovo Group</a> built a unified end-to-end digital platform to increase global data transparency. This initiative affected five business regions worldwide that involve various people, modules, and business chains. The international technology company applied best-practice guidance and deployment planning methods from customer success experts to create an intelligent innovation culture for the enterprise.</p>
  <p>Through the SAP Preferred Success plan for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management.html">SAP Ariba solutions</a>, Lenovo received exclusive and ongoing access to subject-matter specialists, which proved invaluable when resolving technical issues, addressing functionality concerns, and driving user adoption. Moreover, the company has benefited from frequent workshops to review available features and functionality, develop product adoption strategies, and introduce technical enhancements catering to its globalization goals.</p>
  <p>This approach, anchored in a digital mindset, positioned Lenovo on a forward trajectory, enabling it to navigate complex regional compliance and business convergence processes effectively. In return, Lenovo is taking significant steps toward enhancing its operational efficiency and transparency. For example, developing a customized statement system known as the “Progress Cockpit” offers critical business data visibility and traceability, empowering Lenovo to make data-driven decisions more effectively.</p>
  <h2 id="delivering-quality-products-by-amplifying-the-impact-of-cloud-erp">Delivering Quality Products by Amplifying the Impact of Cloud ERP</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2022/12/7623b1c0-577e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Grupo La Moderna</a> has experienced a smooth and rapid implementation of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition</a> in its Services and Cookies divisions. The deployment helped simplify the food producer’s IT infrastructure and significantly reduced its database size. In addition, best practice-based processes supported by the software enable employees to work faster and more productively, and ready access to expertise allows incidents to be handled quickly and efficiently.</p>

  <p>To minimize implementation risk, experts from SAP Preferred Success carried out success checks at each stage of the project, identifying and addressing issues before they become major problems. Doing so provided the confidence that all necessary preparations were in place for a smooth go live.</p>
  <p>According to Hermilo Peña, CIO of Corporativo La Moderna, “With the services, tools, and direct access to experts provided by the teams from SAP Preferred Success and SAP Services and Support, we were able to effectively prepare for the deployment and develop a master plan for our journey with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition.”</p>
  <p>La Moderna continues to receive guidance in unlocking the potential of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition. For each new release, the company received recommendations tailored to its specific requirements that show how the new features can be best adopted and used.</p>
  <h2 id="pouring-personalization-into-digital-channels">Pouring Personalization into Digital Channels</h2>
  <p>With the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/commerce-cloud.html">SAP Commerce Cloud</a> solution and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/customer-identity.html">customer data solutions from SAP</a> as the foundation for its e-commerce Web site, <a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/07/7619fdf0-807e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Breakthru Beverage</a> now offers a consumer-like shopping experience for B2B customers. The initiative transformed how Breakthru’s sales team connects with and assists its customers, cementing relationships and leading to US$8.4 million in incremental purchases from existing accounts following the launch.</p>
  <p>A complete and personalized success plan from SAP Preferred Success empowered Breakthru to harness the comprehensive functionality of the cloud-based commerce solutions. The company received in-depth recommendations for solution deployments and gained access to a designated customer success partner. Plus, constant communication in the form of technical calls, road map discussions, and continuous delivery of success checks and best-practice sessions helped optimize its solution investment’s value.</p>
  <p>As a result of its transformation, Breakthru has more insights into how and when its customers want to be served. Elsewhere, sales reps have always-on access, supporting real-time selling on the go. Most orders are delivered within 24 hours, while pricing on Breakthru Now is in sync with the pricing sales reps offer. And in terms of efficiency, the company saved 6,000 sales-rep hours following the launch.</p>
  <h2 id="elevating-the-employee-experience-with-the-cloud">Elevating the Employee Experience with the Cloud</h2>
  <p>To strengthen its employee relationships, <a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/04/7a53dae4-6c7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Purolator Inc.</a> transformed its business, HR, and employee experience technology in the cloud. Canada’s largest courier, freight, and logistics company recognized the importance of modernizing its existing on-premise ERP and core HR software. This led to a clear decision to move to <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana-private-edition.html">SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition</a> and the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-central-hris.html">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</a> solution.</p>
  <p>Throughout the cloud migration journey, Purolator relied on SAP Preferred Success to gain access to SAP expert resources – from planning to implementation. This partnership assisted in the company’s integration of existing SAP SuccessFactors solutions with the private edition of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, enhancing the employee experience with self-services and supporting core business operations such as finance.</p>
  <p>Doug Patzelt, HCM lead for the future ERP transformation project at Purolator, explains, “There have been numerous cases when we’ve called on SAP Preferred Success services, and they’ve been critical to the project. Our regular meetings with the team keep us on top of new releases and help with issue resolution.”</p>
  <p>After implementing the cloud solutions, Purolator brought together the company’s HR, IT, and finance teams to establish a new software foundation that works as one integrated system across operations in Canada and the U.S. Employees have access to better HR self-service tools, reporting capabilities, and data analytics – all as part of a harmonized experience that requires less dependence on internal IT resources. More impressively, the company has a newfound ability to quickly grant or revoke access when employees are hired or leave the business.</p>
  <h2 id="easing-an-agile-future-ready-transition-to-the-cloud">Easing an Agile, Future-Ready Transition to the Cloud</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/09/e4b5fcd3-8e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Hitachi High-Tech America Inc.</a> envisioned a reshaping of its operations to form an ideal management model. But instead of improving its current state, the high tech manufacturer invested in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition</a> to create future-ready business operations with a bold step toward becoming an intelligent enterprise.</p>
  <p>Working with SAP Preferred Success, Hitachi was able to not only successfully implement the solution but also obtain tailored release updates. It also received advice on new features, such as mobile apps for the SAP Extended Warehouse Management application.</p>
  <p>To this day, the services provide on-demand, tailored enablement on functional or product updates and solution-specific learning opportunities, including access to the edition of SAP Learning Hub for SAP Preferred Success. They support the go-live of critical functionality, give advanced notice of deprecated items (such as warehouse management APIs), and offer extensive access to expert resources to address questions and provide crucial knowledge. Plus, Hitachi has a close relationship with an internal SAP advocate who escalates issues, helps resolve critical items, and connects with a development team from SAP to clearly communicate needs.</p>
  <p>“We have been very pleased with the quality and caliber of the team of experts for SAP Preferred Success,” says Randal Miller, general manager of the IT division at Hitachi. “They actively engaged with our needs and took ownership to resolve issues. We greatly appreciate their guidance and continued support as we move forward from our on-premise ERP system mindset toward leveraging the capabilities of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition.”</p>
  <h2 id="raising-the-bar-in-2024-and-beyond">Raising the Bar in 2024 and Beyond</h2>
  <p>Reflecting on these initiatives and many more achieved by organizations using cloud solutions from SAP in partnership with SAP Preferred Success, it is no wonder transformations now go beyond incremental improvements and the adoption of breakthrough technologies. They have the required guidance to prioritize their growth and operational efficiency while improving resiliency, embracing integration, driving personalization, and eliminating technology debt.</p>
  <p>Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, we anticipate that our customers will have the choice to gain additional advantages from the expanded edition of SAP Preferred Success, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prescriptive solution reviews that aid more-effective decision-making</li>
    <li>Feature adoption assistance for building and operating resilient solutions</li>
    <li>Extended expert access and enhanced services to maximize the use of cloud investments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With such a strategic, expertise-led, and cloud-centric approach, our customers will continue to be well-prepared to explore new business opportunities and tackle any challenges that come their way.</p>

    <div>
      <div>In today’s environment, customers are reevaluating how they use and source software solutions to run their business. The move from on-premise only solutions to the cloud is SAP’s reality as a cloud vendor.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Customers undergo a cloud transformation because they want to accelerate their time to realize business value and they want to take advantage of innovations faster,” says Rohan Patel, global vice president, Customer Support and Innovation, Product Support – Procurement, SAP. “That’s what helps them maintain a competitive edge. And they want to do this while decreasing overall cost and minimizing risk.”</p>
  <p>This is where <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/strategy.html">Real-Time Support</a> from SAP can add real value. In this conversation, Patel gives insight into how SAP support can benefit procurement customers.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: How are you supporting procurement customers on their journey to the cloud?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Support in the old, on-premise world is what I like to call ‘break-fix’ support. When something failed, the IT department submitted a ticket for support, the problem was fixed, and communication ended until another issue arose. Being a break-fix support provider doesn’t work in the cloud environment. Support requires speed and foresight. Support today identifies problems and optimizes products before customers even notice something’s not working as it should.</p>
  <p>SAP’s strategy is predictive and proactive. We want continuous dialogue with customers to provide insights and guidance that are a value-add so we’re there long before something breaks. Success in the cloud requires adoption outside of the traditional IT environment. Business end users and lines of business, like procurement, supply chain, and HR, expect easy-to-use support portals that are intuitive and quickly anticipate user needs.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Can you share some examples of how SAP is using data to enhance predictive support?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The tools we use not only help us deliver a great experience to our customers, they also continue to improve the SAP solution itself. Consider the cloud health monitoring tools within <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm.html">SAP Cloud ALM</a>, our application lifecycle management solution that helps streamline the way our customers implement and operate their cloud and hybrid environments across the entire business.</p>
  <p>These tools can analyze what’s happening at the customer experience layer – for example, how long it takes a specific page to load, how long a user needs to complete a task, and any delays that could frustrate users, hinder adoption, and slow business outcomes. We act proactively at the engineering and cloud operations layer to help continuously improve that user experience.</p>
  <p>We also use knowledge and data to improve the support experience, such as with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html">SAP Business Network</a>, which has millions of active trading partners. This business-to-business network of companies connecting, transacting, and partnering with numerous shared processes and information expands the SAP footprint well beyond the four walls of traditional operations.</p>
  <p>Equally important is that our consumers today aren’t just IT support users, but rather work in departments throughout the clients’ operations. We’ve taken steps to help meet the needs of all those different user types. We can provide quick, easy-to-understand guidance and answers to their questions using intuitive, personalized, and real-time channels driven by both humans and artificial intelligence (AI). This recommendation engine can provide guided answers based on who the users are, what they’re doing in the application, or what questions they ask. Users can quickly get useful and relevant content for answering their questions. The data from those guided-answer experiences is then fed into the product road map to help make the entire user experience more optimal and eliminate problems before they happen.</p>

      <div><strong>What have procurement customers seen in 2023 from SAP support?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Our procurement coverage in 2023 hits two themes: harmonization and Real-Time Support. Let me begin with the harmonization perspective. We’re taking significant steps to create a customer support experience that’s consistent across all SAP solutions – most notably a single entry point to SAP support with <a href="https://me.sap.com/">SAP for Me</a>. SAP Fieldglass solutions went live on SAP for Me case management in March 2023, and SAP Ariba solutions and SAP Business Network will soon follow. The SAP for Me portal can give users the information and answers they need, specific to the solution they’re using. Earlier this year, procurement support went live on <a href="https://community.sap.com/">SAP Community</a>, where our business and IT users can access blog posts, tips, and connect with experts. Even customers and partners can provide an additional layer of insights and guidance, especially to a specific industry.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="learn-more-about-real-time-support">Learn more about Real-Time Support</h3>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This year we have been working to bring our Real-Time Support concept to reality for procurement. When I talk about Real-Time Support, I mean support that is always on, continuously evolves, and adapts to customer needs. This can be direct access to support experts for business-critical processes when and where customers need it. It’s the live support channels such as <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html?anchorId=section_519294480">Expert Chat</a>, Ask an Expert Peer, context-sensitive help, <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html?anchorId=section_1255553798">support built into our software</a>, and <a href="/2022/05/artificial-intelligence-future-of-customer-support-experiences">AI-driven self-service access</a> to a vast knowledge base and user community.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>What do you see in the future of support for procurement?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I envision a day when customers don’t need to see or hear from us because we’re already working behind the scenes to give our customers a seamless, reliable, and delightful experience. The ultimate vision is preventative support with the help of AI and machine learning – in other words, self-healing IT systems.</p>
  <p>Of course, there will always be times when customers need us. In those times, SAP is prepared to offer as simple of a support experience as possible, such as with <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html?anchorId=section_1255553798">Built-In Support</a> and direct access to experts or a quick call to solve an issue the moment it occurs. We also continuously look to disrupt ourselves by using new technologies such as ChatGPT to enable self-help or self-guidance and provide the best possible customer experience.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>What sets the SAP support experience apart in the industry?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP mindfully takes steps that help give customers the best support experience possible. We can provide a cohesive array of support channels, self-service tools, and cloud health and integration monitoring. Even with these successes in hand, SAP will continuously push the boundaries of customer support with new innovations, help ensure support interactions are delightful, and offer Real-Time Support that can bring ambition to life.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The natural order of work is drastically changing as new realities disrupt and suspend workplace traditions, models, and assumptions. For example, jobs are no longer exclusively tied to neatly defined processes or a single business function. Even decision-making is more democratized, regardless of role and experience, as work continues to occur primarily outside the four walls of the workplace.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>According to a <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/12/3020508e-527e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.rc.html">report</a> from The Josh Bersin Company, today’s dynamic workplace environments require a <a href="/topics/human-resources">human capital management</a> (HCM) system that is “ready to use, productive from day one, welcoming to change, and easily adapted to.” The diversity and comprehensiveness of features incorporated into cloud-based <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/hxm-suite.html">human experience management (HXM) solutions from SAP</a> fall into this category, setting the foundation for building impactful, next-generation HCM and HXM solutions.</p>
  <p>Now, you can get the specialized resources and enhanced services necessary to unleash the full potential of your HXM solution investment. Using the SAP Preferred Success service for HXM solutions from SAP, expanded edition, you can optimize the value of SAP SuccessFactors solutions by benefiting from a closer partnership for workplace transformation.</p>

  <p>From planning to go-live and active operation of an SAP SuccessFactors solution, your business can realize significant value from SAP Preferred Success for HXM solutions from SAP, expanded edition. The edition can not only protect your workforce and organizational data and HR applications but can also set the foundation for a long-term partnership that drives continuous knowledge transfer, technical upskilling, and increased awareness of relevant software updates.</p>
  <p>Building on the existing SAP Preferred Success service for HXM solutions from SAP, the edition helps accelerate business transformation success. It can provide extended access to subject-matter experts in cloud adoption, a set of prescriptive reviews of business needs and applications that support daily operations, and assistance with feature adoption. More importantly, you can develop and operate resilient solutions, maximize the value of your cloud investment, and make effective decisions that support business goals.</p>
  <p>Let’s start with <strong>extended access to functional technical resources</strong>. Your HR organization and stakeholders can engage with experts offering the technical and functional guidance you need to understand existing business processes, assess and maximize product usage, and accelerate outcomes. Throughout this service engagement, you can closely collaborate and align future updates, landscape changes, and service delivery and follow-up with a technical and functional resource. The expert can also help orchestrate how-to conversations, review your calendar and plans, and document your landscape.</p>
  <p>Then, with <strong>proactive monitoring</strong>, you can work with an SAP technical resource to oversee the five most critical managed jobs for your business. You and an SAP delivery specialist can create a standard operating procedure for each job, which is used to determine what needs to be done and which actions should be taken if a failure arises.</p>
  <p>Next, an annual <strong>solution stabilization review</strong> of all live modules of your HXM solution investment is conducted. This experience allows you to schedule services required to be completed for each live module and validates usage compared to best practices to identify gaps or improvement opportunities. Moreover, you can gain recommendations for continuous improvement activities and increased adoption over time.</p>
  <p>And last but not least, <strong>new feature activation</strong> is available to help plan, discover, explore, test, enable, and measure the impact of new functionality. Subject-matter experts can kick off the activation process by mapping your success plan as part of an inclusion list and recommending features that best meet your needs. Then, with the help of an SAP delivery specialist, you can activate your chosen feature in a nonproductive landscape, define a testing strategy that contains a base-level unit evaluation, and start testing in a productive environment. During regular touch points, you and your customer success partner can review the usage of the feature and its impact on your business success plan.</p>
