      <div>As businesses adapt to digitalization, they encounter various trends reshaping tax compliance. From emerging business models to governments’ digital initiatives, the tax landscape is undergoing significant transformation.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Authorities are starting to involve themselves in business transactions, disrupting well-established business processes and taking control of the invoicing flow between suppliers and buyers. As a result, they have the data needed to prevent tax evasion and start auditing taxpayers automatically or even auto-populating tax returns moving toward tax bills. Additionally, sustainability efforts and climate change regulations further impact tax regulations.</p>
  <p>Amid these shifts, SAP can provide peace of mind to navigate complexities efficiently. By understanding the evolving tax landscape, businesses can leverage SAP solutions to help streamline compliance processes and drive automation to capitalize on emerging opportunities.</p>
  <p>SAP solutions for global tax management are tailored to help address modern tax challenges. <a href="/topics/erp">SAP S/4HANA Cloud</a> can provide transparency and compliance on a global scale, enabling businesses to embed tax requirements in processes.</p>

  <p>Through localized solutions that offer standardized but flexible business processes, a complete suite of solutions facilitates efficient tax management, from e-invoicing to statutory reporting and overall tax compliance. With SAP technology and expertise, businesses can achieve greater accuracy and agility in tax compliance, paving the way for sustainable growth and competitive advantage.</p>
  <p>To help tax professionals prepare for and become valuable members of tax transformation projects, SAP is introducing a new course: <strong><a href="https://open.sap.com/courses/s4htax-pc">Unlocking Tax Transformation with SAP</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>The course is designed to equip professionals with the knowledge needed to navigate today’s tax landscape and learn new capabilities that can be leveraged as part of SAP S/4HANA-enabled transformations to simplify tax compliance.</p>
  <p>The course offers practical strategies to learn about the different tax types, global developments and their business relevance, and the importance of technology with a focus on SAP S/4HANA and SAP solutions for global tax management. It begins on April 30 and <a href="https://open.sap.com/courses/s4htax-pc">enrollment is now open</a>. By enrolling in this course, tax professionals can gain valuable insights into industry best practices and leverage the latest SAP innovations to help optimize their tax processes.</p>
  <p>In a time of rapid change, SAP supports businesses on their journey to tax compliance and growth. Through collaboration with SAP and a commitment to continuous learning, businesses can navigate the complexities of taxation with confidence and achieve their long-term objectives.</p>

  <p>At SAP, our commitment extends beyond traditional financial planning and analysis (FP&#x26;A), reaching across the entire enterprise of financial professionals. To achieve a comprehensive FP&#x26;A transformation, organizations need effortless access to crucial finance data, regardless of its location. In a landscape where financial information is dispersed across various applications, files, and systems – both on premise and in the cloud – organizations often expend significant resources on extracting, rebuilding, and integrating their financial data to deliver forecasts and simulations.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>If your organization has a stake in preventing fraud across your digital commerce operations, I’ll venture to say that you want Michael Reitblat and his team at Forter on your side.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As co-founder of the preeminent fraud-detection platform on the market – now available on <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000042467_live_v1/Forter%20Fraud%20Protection">SAP Store</a> – Reitblat told me that he has long experience in the “bad guy space,” building a successful career around staying ahead of bad actors. That means he’s the good guy for those making an honest living selling products and services online, and for buyers and shoppers making purchases digitally.</p>
  <p>Known as “The Trust Platform” for digital commerce, Forter doesn’t focus on keeping people out, rather on creating a seamless customer experience for trusted shoppers. How is this done? Machine learning and automated decisioning. Built upon a data set of billions of online identities, the Forter platform provides accurate decisions on whether the end shopper is who they say they are instantly. This ability to provide real-time decisions also streamlines merchant operations, eliminating any dependence on manual transaction reviews. That’s the key to understanding the value of this great app.</p>
  <p>The truth is that both online consumers and merchants are victimized by sophisticated, well-organized fraud networks, Reitblat explained, stealing and selling data in a chain of hard-to-detect transactions. To counteract that, merchants can inadvertently block shoppers who most need to purchase online because they fit the “wrong profile” – living in a country known for a high preponderance of fraudsters, for example. Someone might live a long distance from a physical retailer and be unable to buy essential items online, through no fault of their own. “We are here to give those buyers access, and that is a great source of pride,” he remarked. Further, if a consumer faces hurdles to online purchasing because of clumsy verification processes, they’ll just shop somewhere else. It is therefore crucial to eliminate false declines and reduce friction throughout the purchase journey.</p>

  <h2 id="foiling-scams-through-a-circle-of-trust">Foiling Scams through a Circle of Trust</h2>
  <p>It’s somewhat ironic that the best way to thwart fraud is to operate in an environment of trust. In fact, trust among competitors is at the heart of Forter Fraud Protection. Criminals will target one type of company – a shoe manufacturer, for example – and, when detected, move on to exploit the next, giving them the advantage. “We reverse that asymmetry,” Reitblat said. “If you attack one of our customers, the others are immunized, thanks to an aggregated global network of data. They would never share their data with each other, but they are happy to do it through us.” Simply put, the Forter solution is built to recognize people through their data profile and authenticate them quickly and automatically.</p>
  <p>I asked Reitblat about credit card protection. When a consumer reports a fraudulent charge, he replied, the onus is on the retailer, who is left with the expense and is subject to fines or suspension by the credit card issuers if there are too many instances. I was also curious about how Forter stays in front of the fraudsters. Let’s just say that Reitblat, who grew up in Israel and was once a member of the intelligence community there, has his people. “Detecting security breaches, theft, the dark economy – it’s the same world,” he said. “We have an active research team staying on top of these constantly evolving threats.”</p>

  <p>Reitblat co-founded Forter after working with a cybersecurity company that went through an acquisition – a crushing blow for him. Fortunately, he had reunited with an old high school friend from Jerusalem who also recognized that online commerce was about to take off. “In 2013, we still had to convince investors of the need for an authentication capability, and that it had to be fully automated or otherwise would require too many people to be scalable.” That resistance changed quickly, and today Forter is larger than many of its major customers, processing more than US$250 billion in transaction value per year and employing 500 professionals around the world. The solution is deployed in more than 30 countries.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://news.sap.com/tags/covid-19">events of the past two years</a> have resulted in a burst of demand that Reitblat and his partner could not have foreseen. Besides the explosion in online shopping, purchasing behavior and customer demographics across industries changed. New retail features appeared, like curbside pickup, buy online/pick up in store (BOPIS), and contactless check-in and check-out in the hospitality industry. New online buyers included senior citizens, students, and those in advancing geographies who had never transacted online before. Additionally, with the sudden surge of orders to be delivered to alternate addresses – holiday gifts, for example, or people purchasing for family members – e-commerce systems had an extra challenge in verifying legitimacy. That process was less complex for Forter customers because its customers were already authenticated in the system.</p>
  <p>Forter Fraud Protection is tightly integrated with SAP Commerce Cloud. Laura Jorgens, director of Partnerships for Forter, acknowledged SAP partner <a href="https://netconomy.net/">Netconomy</a> for its “incredible support” in building out the integration. “Working with SAP and Netconomy feels like one ecosystem pulling together,” she said. “Hats off to the SAP partnership organization.” With the inclusion of Forter’s solution on SAP Store, she added, “SAP has become one of Forter’s most important partners.”</p>
  <p>Why not see for yourself how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp3RHdk5Yic">Forter Trust Platform</a> works?

  <h2 id="security-cultures-prioritize-new-business-practices">Security Cultures Prioritize New Business Practices</h2>
  <p>As every company becomes technology-driven, risks are escalating, pushing security much closer to the top of business priorities. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/the-top-8-cybersecurity-predictions-for-2021-2022">Gartner</a> researchers said that by 2025, 70% of CEOs will mandate a culture of organizational resilience to survive coinciding threats from cybercrime, severe weather events, civil unrest, and political instabilities. Meanwhile, security cultures will have changed numerous business practices. By next year, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US47193621">IDC</a> analysts said that 80% of organizations faced with complex global regulations will increase security compliance automation investments by 25% to consistently meet policies and regulations. In the same time frame, IDC predicted 25% of G2000 public cloud customers will subscribe to integrated risk management and cyber-insurance policies through shared fate/risk programs to protect against sophisticated cyberattacks.</p>
  <h2 id="make-security-a-company-wide-responsibility">Make Security a Company-Wide Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Security and risk leaders who responded to a recent Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/develop-a-security-strategy-for-cyber-physical-systems/">survey</a> ranked the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems as their top concerns for the next three to five years. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/trends/the-it-roadmap-for-cybersecurity">Gartner</a> analysts predicted that by 2023, 75% of organizations will restructure risk and security governance to address the widespread adoption of advanced technologies, an increase from less than 15% today.</p>
  <p>In a world where just about every organization is in the computer industry, embedded secure practices across the organization are table stakes. For example, SAP follows the NIST (National Institute of Technology in North America) cybersecurity framework, a holistic security strategy based on repeatable processes. This approach harmonizes controlled security company-wide, including product development and operations.</p>
  <p>“Security has always been our number one concern,” said Tim McKnight, executive vice president and chief security officer at SAP. “With the acceleration of digitalization, organizations have embarked on a massive cloud-based computing transformation that extends to security. We’ve undergone a multi-year security transformation backed by the commitment of our Executive Board and real-time input from customers.”</p>
  <p>A security culture comes down to a shared vision that’s carried out by leaders who make security a priority and teams who participate in ongoing trainings that celebrate success and learn from failures. People in any sector can take a page out of the software applications industry playbook.</p>
  <p>“We’ve set cybersecurity goals for all of our executives,” said McKnight. “We present these measures to the Board on a regular basis, reviewing progress against security initiatives. With open conversations around security, we reinforce priorities while driving accountability from each department. Whether you’re an executive, team lead, or individual contributor, you need to understand your role in driving a security culture with a security-first mentality. After all, the vast majority of security incidents are the result of human error.”</p>

  <p>While just-in-time supply chains boost business agility in a <a href="/topics/covid-19">post-pandemic</a> environment, having more partners also increases risk. <a href="https://www.forrester.com/predictions/">Forrester</a> researchers predicted that 60% of security incidents will involve third parties in 2022. Maybe that’s why <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US47193621">IDC</a> researchers said that by next year, 55% of organizations will allocate half of their security budgets to cross-technology ecosystems and platforms designed for rapid consumption and unified security capabilities to drive agile innovation.</p>
  <p>Companies need to allocate sufficient resources to prioritize security across the entire product life cycle, from development through go-live and support. With intelligent capabilities from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, robotic process automation (RPA), and other technologies, products and services increasingly require advanced security measures.</p>
  <p>“An effective culture makes security everyone’s responsibility,” said Wiebke Thelo, senior vice president and head of SAP Quality, Application Security, and Production. “For example, business information security officers at SAP report directly into business unit leaders. They work together, making sure that security is embedded into product design, development, and operation.”</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US48154621&#x26;pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY">IDC</a> research showed that close to 25% of organizations report ransomware infections weekly. Human judgment is core to preventing these incidents. However, <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2022-continued-uncertainty-forces-attention-on-securing-relationships/">Forrester</a> analysts warned about the “security brain drain” as one in 10 experienced professionals have exited the industry during the past year. These analysts advised security executives to address burnout and team culture problems and use succession planning to build a pipeline of security leaders.</p>

  <p>“A security culture requires significant learning and development, which is why we’ve professionalized security,” said McKnight. “The human element is critical – we position people first, process second, and technology third. We start with our people and make sure they have the skills they need.”</p>
  <p>As remote working, just-in-time supply chains, and tech innovations continue, companies have to think and act faster than the criminals. There’s never a good time for a cyberattack. Just ask the people who suffered through the cream cheese shortage. Criminals don’t take holidays and a security culture is the best protection.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/index.html">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced a new agreement with Yale University’s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs to foster early cybersecurity talent and promote diversity in the field.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The relationship will see SAP sponsor the <a href="https://cyber.forum.yale.edu/">Yale Cyber Leadership Forum</a>, a collaboration between Yale Law School’s Center for Global Legal Challenges, the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs and the Department of Computer Science, which aims to prepare next-generation technologists to address the most pressing issues in the cybersecurity sector.</p>
  <p>SAP’s sponsorship will include scholarships, funding for diverse groups of students, educational materials, professional mentorship and access to jobs and internships for students aiming to pursue careers in cybersecurity, while also strengthening collaboration between the business and academic communities.</p>
  <p>Additionally, SAP will live-stream the Yale Cyber Leadership Forum sessions to the public, for the first time making it possible to view and participate in its educational events and discussions.</p>
  <p>“Greater workforce diversity is synonymous with innovation, creativity and a more secure enterprise landscape,” said Tim McKnight, EVP and Chief Security Officer of SAP. “By opening cybersecurity conversations and learning opportunities to a broader audience, we aim to foster a new generation of diverse talent.”</p>
  <p>Yale University’s Ted Wittenstein, Executive Director of the Jackson Institute’s new <a href="https://jackson.yale.edu/iss/research-projects/schmidt-program/">Schmidt Program on Artificial Intelligence, Emerging Technologies and National Power</a>, which examines how artificial intelligence has the potential to alter the fundamental building blocks of world affairs, noted that this new relationship will enable expanded student and public participation as well as help strengthen cybersecurity collaboration among the business and academic communities.</p>
  <p>SAP’s Chief Trust Officer, Elena Kvochko, pointed out that by offering SAP’s vast technology network to broadcast Forum sessions, the company will help reach a broad array of audiences, including opening the Yale platform to underserved populations and providing opportunities for individuals to participate, learn and prepare for careers in cybersecurity.</p>
  <p>SAP brings security experts to the Forum’s extensive network of attorneys, technologists, entrepreneurs and policymakers, and will provide coaching and early career mentorship opportunities for students.</p>

      <div><strong><a href="/2021/04/sap-onapsis-application-cyber-threat">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Almost every day, we see yet another case of ransomware. While historically, companies of all sizes are targeted, recently it appears that all the news revolves around debilitating attacks on mission-critical or business-critical systems of large enterprises — from fuel and energy companies to food processing companies.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It’s not that these enterprises haven’t taken steps to protect these assets; it’s just that the “traditional” way of preparing for and responding to ransomware simply won’t work anymore.</p>
  <p>So what’s needed to protect your organization’s business-critical applications from the looming threat of ransomware? That’s exactly what SAP and Onapsis seek to address here.</p>
  <p>When most people think about ransomware, there are two immediate, “traditional” solutions that come to mind: backups and endpoint security. Both are critical components of a solid security program, without a doubt. However, their presence could lull organizations into a false sense of security, as there still remain gaps, especially related to business-critical systems that are connected in more ways than ever before.</p>
  <p>The challenge is that many enterprises realize too late that, in preparation for a ransomware attack, you need to close all the doors and windows of your house — not just the front door of endpoint protection. When thinking about ransomware attack vectors, it’s imperative to consider all potential entry points into the business-critical environment and how to secure them. To continue this metaphor, this also includes evaluating your neighbors and how they get into your house too.</p>
  <p>When you think about all of these vectors, you slowly realize that this challenge goes way beyond just endpoint security and backups. It requires a more holistic look at securing your business-critical applications, including — yes — things that we would classify as “good security hygiene.”</p>
  <p>In a recent <a href="https://onapsis.com/active-cyberattacks-mission-critical-sap-applications">joint Onapsis and SAP threat intelligence report</a>, we demonstrated that threat actors clearly have the means, the motivation, and the expertise to identify and exploit unprotected mission-critical applications, and are, in fact, actively doing so.</p>
  <p>As an example, a massive, publicly traded company was recently subjected to a ransomware attack on its enterprise resource planning (ERP) application data. Did they have backups? Yes: the backup was refreshed once a week. However, operations halted anyway. When this happens, even with backups in place, it could still take hours or even days to restore from a backup, and the negative impact on the business and the financial losses are high regardless. Did they have endpoint security? Yes; however, the attackers bypassed the endpoint detection and response (EDR) software by accessing the data through the application. EDR is great for identifying activities on compromised assets and allowing the containment and collection of artifacts, such as process trees, files created by malware, but the application level still poses a challenge. And these attackers used that application layer, which was not monitored by the tool itself, to compromise the business-critical assets.</p>
  <p>Vulnerabilities such as 10KBLAZE, PayDay, and RECON allow threat actors to take full control of applications through the application layer itself. These threat actors go straight to the application, and, once in, go down to the operating system level there. When you consider CIO digital transformation initiatives or the rapid adjustment to remote work due to the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic, there is a significant magnification of risk. Onapsis has observed that new, unprotected SAP applications provisioned in IaaS environments were discovered by threat actors and attacked in less than three hours, with more than 400 successful exploitations observed as of the date of this publication.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, what’s needed then is a new model to defend against ransomware, one that goes beyond the scope of just protecting endpoints, backing up files, and hoping for the best. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/3993171">Gartner</a> claims that organizations should “[i]mplement a risk-based vulnerability management process that includes threat intelligence. Ransomware often relies on unpatched systems to allow lateral movement. This should be a continuous process. The risk associated with vulnerabilities changes as these vulnerabilities are exploited by attackers.” We couldn’t agree more.</p>
  <p>What’s needed is a renewed commitment to some key security fundamentals:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Security Hardening of Business-Critical Applications</li>
    <li>Timely Patch Management</li>
    <li>Point-in-Time Vulnerability Assessments</li>
    <li>Continuous Monitoring of Vulnerabilities and Threats to Your Business-Critical Applications</li>
    <li>Securing Your Custom Code in Business-Critical Applications</li>
    <li>A Commitment to Control and Governance</li>
  </ol>
  <p>SAP is committed to continuously innovating our software to keep your information safe — both on premise and in the cloud. We prioritize security so that you can stay focused on running your business and managing your customer relationships effectively using SAP solutions, safe in the knowledge that your data is secured. To protect clients from ransomware attacks, securing development infrastructure, such as the build and deploy chain, is of utmost importance to prevent the manipulation of shipment artifacts.</p>

  <p>As part of our commitment to clients, SAP follows a secure software development and operations lifecycle to identify and mitigate all kinds of security weaknesses and vulnerabilities during the development of products and services. Through the use of risk identification techniques such as the SAP threat modeling method and secure development trainings, SAP enables development teams to eliminate potential entry points for ransomware and other kind of attacks. It also ensures that basic security principles, such as that of least privilege, are part of the DNA of SAP developers.</p>
  <p>SAP continues to harden our systems with automated static code analysis, vulnerability scans, and validation from a dedicated, independent SAP internal security team. SAP’s software development lifecycle serves as an example to clients on how to support a DevSecOps model covering development and operations aspects for continuous and secure delivery of software.</p>
  <p>When deploying and running SAP applications, it is imperative that organizations focus on hardening their system to minimize the overall attack surface — for example, ensuring the proper setting of system parameters and other aspects of system configuration, including the activation of security features and functionalities. It is important that the proper configuration settings are in place to protect an organization against possible security vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p>SAP provides key features such as the SAP EarlyWatch Alert service, which monitors the essential administrative areas of SAP components to keep organizations up to date on performance and stability as well as the SAP Security Optimization service, which verifies and improves the security by identifying potential security issues related to your SAP solution and providing key recommendations.</p>
  <p>As threat actors continue to devise new modes of attack and vulnerabilities to these attacks are identified, SAP continuously provides security updates for existing code to keep your systems secure. SAP delivers these security updates through support packages, and, on the second Tuesday of every month, as part of “Security Patch Day,” SAP publishes security notes with the latest security corrections and recommendations. As noted, implementing a security maintenance process to assess and implement recommended security updates is a proven best practice for mitigating risk.</p>
  <p>Onapsis has focused on protecting business-critical applications since 2009. We target the application layer with our Onapsis platform and serve an essential part of our clients’ plans to protect their business-critical SAP applications from ransomware attacks.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By providing automatic visibility into critical vulnerabilities, missing important patches and security updates, misconfigurations, and insecure interfaces, Onapsis identifies all the open doors. This is a crucial component in any ransomware prevention initiative. Once the entry points are identified, they can be closed, thereby reducing the attack surface that may lead to ransomware.</li>
    <li>Through continuous monitoring and real-time alerts for threat indicators, Onapsis helps monitor real-time attempts to access critical systems through any remaining open doors. Win precious time to prevent threat actors from gaining further access.</li>
    <li>With code analysis in real time, prior to moving into production, and in transport, Onapsis can help identify foreign code, such as malware, or new vulnerabilities before they get released to the public. Code vulnerabilities may appear to be a minor attack vector, until they’re not, such as in the case of the Solar Winds attack. In Onapsis’ experience, we generally see one critical vulnerability per 1,000 lines of code, but our clients generally have <strong>millions of lines</strong> of custom code. It’s important to close those thousands of open doors to prevent any access to business-critical systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It’s time to think differently about ransomware. We’re in the middle of a perfect storm, with more unprotected SAP applications and remote workers than ever before, expert threat actors who have the expertise to attack these systems, hyperconnected business-critical systems across the cloud, and strained InfoSec teams that may have fallen behind in patching and vulnerability management. Ransomware is the final step of an attack that could utilize a myriad of attack vectors to directly access your business-critical applications.</p>
  <p>Organizations should leverage the powerful native security capabilities of SAP, establish the right risk-based patch, code, and vulnerability management processes, and take advantage of the optimized tools and critical threat intelligence from Onapsis. If they do so, organizations can drastically reduce their risk profiles, stay a step ahead of ransomware groups, and ultimately keep their names out of the news.</p>
