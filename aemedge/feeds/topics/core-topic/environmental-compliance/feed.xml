        <p>Next-generation farming processes promise higher yields, greater efficiency, and better sustainability, all of which will improve business performance.</p>

  <p>That last ice cream cone you enjoyed was creamy, sweet, and refreshing. It was also the product of data. This includes data about weather and soil conditions, crop protection, and livestock well-being. Data that measures improvements in productivity. Data that tracks the efficient use of resources so future generations of farmers can continue to tend their crops – and future consumers will enjoy frosty treats that originate with their harvests, like the sugar, cream (or oat milk if you want) and flour for the crunchy cone.</p>
  <p>The journey from farm to table is a long one. It can take years for farmers to cultivate inputs (seeds, plants, livestock) and manage resources just to get their products ready for sale and distribution. Then it’s time to prepare for the next season. And then do everything all over again, only better.</p>

  <p>The digitalization of farming practices is closely connected with the concept of precision agriculture. It’s a concept that has been studied for decades, starting in the 1980s with the advent of geographic information systems that tracked crop production and field conditions. Since then, the amount of data that is captured around fields and farms has increased steadily.</p>
  <p>But while the introduction of AI and machine learning applications injects fresh promise of productivity gains in agriculture, today’s farming companies face two major challenges. The first is cultural: because farmers have been familiar with their processes for years if not generations, it can take extra effort to overcome skepticism and subsequently adopt new practices that take advantage of those growing data sources. The second challenge is data-centric and technical: there is often a lack of standards to use the data in AI and analytics applications efficiently that can help companies improve farming processes.</p>
  <p>These challenges confront farmers in a global context that affects all industries and raises the stakes for farmers using data to improve productivity and resource management. Factors include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Extreme weather:</strong> The environment is more precarious than ever, with extreme weather events threatening to render time-tested farming practices obsolete at a time when the world needs productive farms more than ever.</li>
    <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> When war breaks out, as it did when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it disrupts the global movement of agricultural products such as wheat, exacerbating supply shortages in regions such as the Horn of Africa, as NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/07/19/1188714712/russias-nixing-of-ukraine-grain-deal-deepens-worries-about-global-food-supply">reported</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Global hunger:</strong> In July 2023, there were 643 million people in 88 countries who did not have sufficient food available to them, according to <a href="https://static.hungermapdata.org/insight-reports/latest/global-summary.pdf">estimates</a> from the United Nations World Food Program.</li>
    <li><strong>Population growth:</strong> UN projections note the world’s population is expected to rise by nearly 2 billion in the next three decades, to reach <a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population">9.7 billion in 2050</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Consumer demands for transparency:</strong> In developed economies, more demanding consumers want to see where their food comes from and how it’s produced. A 2022 survey of U.S. households found consumers want food brands and retailers to share not just the ingredients in the food they buy but also information about manufacturing practices, ingredient sourcing, and company sustainability efforts, <em>Supermarket News</em> <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/consumer-trends/survey-consumers-demand-deeper-transparency-food-brands-retailers">reported</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The better use of data and technologies like AI to inform decision-making promises to put agribusinesses on a path to address these challenges so that enterprises (many of which include their own farming operations or collaboration with other farmers) can improve their business processes. The adoption of what experts call precision agriculture is still in its early period, but there’s no question it’s spreading.</p>
  <p>A 2023 McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/agtech-breaking-down-the-farmer-adoption-dilemma">report</a> found that “though agricultural technology adoption is slow, farmers are open to innovation.” Agribusinesses based in North and South America were more likely to have adopted, or have plans in place to implement, precision agriculture systems such as yield monitoring, variable rate fertilizer applications, and in-field soil sensors, the report notes. Even so, momentum is building.</p>
  <p>But first, farmers have to trust that the data will help them.</p>

  <h2 id="gaining-the-trust-of-farmers">Gaining the trust of farmers</h2>
  <p>Business process shifts that call for using data to drive decision-making are challenging by definition. Adopting AI and data-driven agricultural processes is like an aircraft pilot accustomed to flying visually shifting to instruments to guide their flight. A farmer can’t always see the data that goes into the decision-support systems. There has to be trust in the systems that indicate the next-best irrigation setting or pest-control treatment.</p>
  <p>In our experience, this change in mindset needs to take root in different levels of the agribusiness organization. It’s not enough for the top decision-makers to buy in. The farm managers and those closest to the field need to adopt the new ways of working. We’ve witnessed large organizations that invest in producing impressive data-driven models to guide improving irrigation and fertilization programs, to improve a farm’s efficiency and sustainability. However, if managers on the ground are skeptical of this new information, and a change fails to occur, the company risks missing out.</p>
  <p>What’s needed: a deliberate, incremental, iterative approach that brings data to agriculture in ways that mirror farmers’ experiences. Going step-by-step makes it possible to make small changes and gain support from farmers used to planting and harvesting the same way they always have. Many farming companies want to build upon the business practices they have honed over time. It’s their secret sauce. They want to ensure that the farming experience they have had for many years is one of the ingredients for future success. By using AI models that produce recommendations in discrete parts of the process – fertilization, irrigation, crop protection, and variety selection – farmers can start to adopt digital decision-support models in a non-interrupting way. The AI models can be tested, and farmers can build confidence in the systems’ recommendations. Feedback loops and continuous improvement are another crucial success factor.</p>

  <p>At the Royal Swatini Sugar Corporation (RES) based in the Swazi nation in southern Africa, executives have made real progress in adopting new precision agriculture systems. The 4,500-employee company produces as much as <a href="https://www.res.co.sz/admin/documents/RES%20integratd%20report%202022.pdf">470,00 metric tons</a> of sugar per season for use in ethanol, fertilizer products, and beverages to customers in Africa, Europe, and Asia. It manages approximately 24,450 hectares (more than 60,000 acres) of irrigated sugarcane fields, which include both its farms and partnerships with smaller third-party growers.</p>
  <p>As RES worked to deploy systems to manage farm and field data more consistently to automate tasks and improve decision-making, including the third-party growers was a major focus. In 2023, the company cited numerous benefits from the data-driven farming solutions: a marked improvement in farmers’ ability to plan, implement, and measure the progress of key tasks. It also provides a better understanding for growers about the right time to harvest and higher grower yields.</p>
  <p>The acceptance of the new systems has been vital to improving operations, says Rob Coombe, Group IT manager at RES. “As well as giving us insights into their crop, it lets us learn when is the best time to harvest,” Coombe says in a short <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/05/96a400eb-737e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">video</a> about the company’s efforts. “It’s going to be a key component of our business going forward as it helps us to be more sustainable and efficient on the farm.”</p>

  <h2 id="standardizing-the-use-of-data">Standardizing the use of data</h2>
  <p>The second challenge facing agribusiness companies – collecting and managing the right data so that decision-support models are accurate and valuable – is tied to the first. Getting farmers to trust what systems tell them starts with having good data.</p>
  <p>Today, agribusiness companies are faced with an increasing amount of data collected from the field. But there is often a lack of standard processes and data management practices to make efficient use of that data, so it helps farmers improve their processes.</p>

  <p>At KWS, a Germany-based producer of seeds for farmers around the world cultivating crops like corn, sugar beet, cereals, rapeseed, sunflowers, and soybeans, investments in systems to track conditions on the ground and then use that data to improve productivity and quality have been a priority in recent years. The company, the world’s fourth-largest seed producer, has been in business since 1856.</p>
  <p>KWS <a href="https://www.kws.com/us/en/company/press/world-of-farming/how-farmers-benefit-from-drones-in-plant-breeding/">applies</a> analytics to aerial photos of fields to speed up the collection and analysis of data to detect factors such as fungal infestation, soil conditions (such as moisture), and chlorophyll levels. The analysis is not only more efficient but more accurate than the human eye test.</p>
  <p>Jens Hittmeyer, head of global IT and CIO at KWS, <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/05/8c8100eb-737e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">says</a> plans call for digitizing the company’s entire logistics value chain – from field to plant and then to backend systems.</p>
  <p>“In the future, we will get more and more data from the fields. This will help our farming customers to optimize the input from fertilizers, water, and crop protection so that they can work as sustainable as possible,” he says.</p>
  <p>Think again about that ice cream cone (or other favorite food) that you enjoy. It takes a lot of resources to make up the ingredients – even before it gets to the people who prepare them for consumption. With a growing population and a warming planet, every seed, every plant, and every ounce of water and fertilizer is crucial. Data can make a difference. But only if the farmers who can use that data to their advantage trust what they see in an analytics readout as much as they are accustomed to trusting what they see happening on their farms. This is not just any farms, but <em>their</em> farms. Industrious farmers will yield the fruit of this data harvest.</p>

        <p>Leaders who understand that sustainability has business value still need practical advice for taking action.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Business leaders are awakening to the bottom-line impact of climate change, inequality, and growing demands for transparency. Those who are “gold medalists” in understanding and embracing sustainability as a business issue are still uncommon. But millions more could join them with the right guidance.</p>
  <p>Chris Coulter, coauthor with David Grayson and Mark Lee of <em>The Sustainable Business Handbook: A Guide to Becoming More Innovative, Resilient and Successful</em>, is a coach for these prospective sustainability champions. The book doesn’t try to persuade leaders that sustainability has business value. The authors assume readers already understand the “why,” and instead provide them with the “how,” a road map for creating, integrating, and executing a high-performance sustainability strategy.</p>
  <p>Coulter, the CEO of insights and advisory consultancy GlobeScan, talked to us about why it’s so urgent for the millions of companies who have not yet embarked on their sustainability journey to start now, and how those companies can use <a href="/research/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness">sustainability to increase business value</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="q-its-one-thing-to-understand-that-sustainability-is-important-but-another-to-act-on-that-understanding-what-stops-leaders-from-moving-forward">Q: It’s one thing to understand that sustainability is important, but another to act on that understanding. What stops leaders from moving forward?</h2>
  <p><strong>Chris Coulter:</strong> One of the subtle but critical barriers is the sense that this “sustainability stuff” is complex and intimidating. That’s why we wanted to provide a practical how-to guide to help them embrace it more quickly, given the urgency of doing so. The latest <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/">report</a> from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a dire warning that we need to accelerate our transition to a low-carbon economy. Ongoing inequality in all its forms is taking a toll on our societies. Regulators are beginning to drive important changes that will impact business.</p>
  <p>The real challenge is to get things moving in the near future. Starting in 2024, the European Union (EU) is going to require any company doing business in Europe to report on its environmental and social performance, and also to do a double materiality analysis reporting on activities that are material to both their financial performance and their impact on society, the economy, and the environment. That will affect 55,000 businesses in the EU, and millions more globally with an EU footprint. If they haven’t already adopted a <a href="/resources/redefine-success-sustainability-reporting">reporting infrastructure</a> to incorporate sustainability into their broader accounting, they don’t have time to waste.</p>
  <h2 id="q-how-much-time-does-it-take-for-an-organization-to-do-sustainability-effectively">Q: How much time does it take for an organization to do sustainability effectively?</h2>
  <p><strong>Coulter:</strong> It takes at least two years to build up a successful program, starting with the foundational elements. That includes developing a corporate purpose; determining the most pressing and relevant sustainability issues (such as, materiality) for your particular company; setting goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely; and creating a strategy for reaching those goals.</p>
  <p>Then you have to put your strategy into action by getting each part of the business to identify opportunities that align with your goals and exploring how new business models might enable faster, more substantial progress on sustainability while also driving innovation. You might also want to aim for external recognition: getting consumers to prefer your brand or other companies to use your sustainability efforts as a benchmark. Then the business value of sustainability kicks in: building stronger relations with customers, investors, and suppliers; attracting and retaining talent; and exerting greater influence with governments and civil society to be a partner of choice.</p>
  <h2 id="q-how-can-leaders-start-the-process-of-measuring-sustainability-in-order-to-manage-it-without-feeling-completely-overwhelmed">Q: How can leaders start the process of measuring sustainability in order to manage it without feeling completely overwhelmed?</h2>
  <p><strong>Coulter:</strong> Sustainability requires too much interconnectivity across the organization to work without a centralized function, so leaders need to establish a sustainability unit and hire someone with appropriate expertise to lead and build it, just as they would if they were going to start a new R&#x26;D or technology function.</p>
  <p>To determine where and how much to invest, they also need to build a business case that defines what they mean by “sustainability” beyond simply complying with regulations. That’s where you find your unique value proposition. Start by looking at what regulators, customers, employees, and other stakeholders are doing around sustainability and what they want. Next, look at what the competition is doing and why, and gauge whether you’re ahead of or behind them. Finally, determine your internal goals for sustainability and what practical steps will enable you to achieve those goals and create more value for both the business and society.</p>
  <h2 id="q-how-can-organizations-use-their-existing-data-to-determine-where-to-focus-their-sustainability-efforts-for-the-greatest-impact-or-to-go-beyond-that">Q: How can organizations use their existing data to determine where to focus their sustainability efforts for the greatest impact or to go beyond that?</h2>
  <p><strong>Coulter:</strong> Leaders need to define and communicate to internal stakeholders what a sustainability mindset looks like in the context of the business. The best practice is to use the data you already have to analyze the company’s positive and negative sustainability impacts and how they affect business performance. Reporting on that lets you see what you already do and don’t know, how you compare to your competitors, and any gaps with regulatory requirements, such as the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46">proposed U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission climate disclosure rules</a>. From there, you can determine what other data to collect to make or maintain progress.</p>
  <h2 id="q-as-sustainability-becomes-more-embedded-in-business-decisions-what-should-leaders-do-to-ensure-that-it-continues-to-both-support-and-drive-strategy">Q: As sustainability becomes more embedded in business decisions, what should leaders do to ensure that it continues to both support and drive strategy?</h2>
  <p><strong>Coulter:</strong> The first step is to make sure that sustainability is, in fact, embedded in your business decisions!</p>
  <p>You have to understand where your organization can find value in sustainability, which requires a broad exploration of how it fits into your customer value proposition, your employee value proposition, your influence in the marketplace, and so on. Defining value leads to a strategy that elevates sustainability into something that’s not just incidental, but core to your business.</p>

  <p>This isn’t relevant only to companies that are massive or consumer-facing. One example from our book is Chicago-based logistics group HAVI, which is a major part of McDonald’s global supply chain and so needs to align with McDonald’s sustainability strategy. HAVI created its own sustainability initiative that goes beyond alignment to actively drive McDonald’s goals. The company is now helping to develop new Happy Meal toys made of renewable, recycled, biobased, and/or plant-derived materials – a project that will help McDonald’s eliminate 90% of the fossil fuel-based plastics in Happy Meals by 2025 and make HAVI an even more indispensable business partner in the process.</p>
  <p>Reporting is key to ongoing sustainability. It’s not just delivering a digest of data. Good reporting and analysis defines, articulates, and puts a target on your goals so you can explain those goals internally. It also provides the basis for the narrative that leaders use to share your company’s unique approach to value creation and sustainability.</p>
  <p>Being able to tell that story is important. Companies that aren’t focusing on sustainability now are seriously lagging the demands of the market and dangerously exposed to risk. In a hypertransparent world, they’re going to face revolutions by stakeholders who demand more commitment to and clarity about how they’re part of the solution to a truly existential issue rather than part of the problem.</p>

        <h1 id="sustainability-data-isnt-perfect-but-its-benefits-will-be">Sustainability Data Isn’t Perfect, but Its Benefits Will Be</h1>
        <p>The data you use to manage sustainability could be better. That shouldn’t stop you from taking action.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We know that data is crucial to making your business more profitable. That includes integrating data on environmental sustainability into financial performance management. But given its late invitation to the party, sustainability data is tougher to find and manage.</p>
  <p>That’s okay. It doesn’t have to be perfect to make a meaningful difference.</p>
  <p>This Zen view is borne out by a recent SAP Insights survey that <a href="/research/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness">revealed</a> a group of companies we call the Nows, who recognize that environmental sustainability has already become material to their business performance. These companies have been collecting more data about environmental impacts – and acting on it – for much longer than anyone else. Most importantly, they’re using that data to look for business value, and they’re finding it: they report higher revenues and anticipate greater profits than other companies do.</p>
  <p>The Nows, along with the other respondents to the survey, are challenged by sustainability data. Overall, respondents say it isn’t as good as they would like it to be. They lack confidence that their data is complete and correct, worry that it’s not fresh, and wish it were more transparent and accessible.</p>
  <p>But here’s a difference: compared to other respondents, the Nows cite fewer reasons for being dissatisfied. They are also more successful at using data to determine their sustainability investments and to measure the outcomes and impact.</p>
  <p>This suggests that when deciding to invest in sustainability, your data only has to be good enough to motivate you to act. “You don’t have perfect data in the rest of your business, either,” observes Ian Catley, director at Turnkey Group, whose software provides real-time data collection and analytics that help companies more effectively manage their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts and associated risks. “Don’t expect to be perfect on day one. Just get started.”</p>

  <h2 id="making-business-operations-sustainable">Making business operations sustainable</h2>
  <p>Respondents to the SAP Insights survey say their top barrier to using their sustainability-related data is linking it to improvements in operations. But barriers can be overcome. All respondents seem to be addressing the operational challenge by developing internal metrics for sustainability that take advantage of data that is relevant to their business and environmental objectives. However, the Nows have done so to a greater extent, possibly because their leaders are more focused on sustainability than those at other respondents’ companies.</p>
  <p>All a company needs to begin, then, is finding the right data in enough quantity and reasonable quality to start spotting actionable trends and to choose one reasonable starting point – for example, reducing energy use.</p>
  <p>Even basic data from your company’s utility bills lets you compare electricity use across locations, project future consumption, and reduce it by adopting the best practices of your most energy-efficient sites. More complete data will help you see and manage how much of your energy comes from fossil fuels versus renewable sources so that you can further shrink your carbon footprint.</p>
  <p>In the process, you will develop KPIs for energy consumption and use them to create more value – say, by identifying ways to make power-hungry processes more efficient. Thus, data drives both sustainability and business performance.</p>

  <h2 id="navigating-a-crowded-landscape-of-standards">Navigating a crowded landscape of standards</h2>
  <p>Catley points out that KPIs for energy and water use, <a href="/resources/circularity-creates-value-from-waste">waste production and disposal</a>, and materials consumption will be relevant to companies in every field. As with other performance data, how you use it to make decisions will vary according to industry and company, and it will change over time. An agribusiness could determine that it should optimize fuel use in its planting and harvesting equipment first because that will have the biggest impact on emissions and save the most money compared to addressing electricity consumption in its office buildings. A law firm with no fleet of industrial vehicles could decide it will gain the most by retrofitting its headquarters with solar panels.</p>
  <p>When it comes to finding external guidance about what data to collect and how to report it, the choices are practically endless. And that’s the problem. Broadly accepted <a href="/resources/redefine-success-sustainability-reporting">industry standards</a> for sustainability are still evolving, and regulations differ across the globe. As a result, frameworks developed by a plethora of industry and nonprofit organizations for collecting and reporting data are useful only to the point that they help companies understand the data they have (or need) and communicate it to stakeholders.</p>
  <p>What matters, says Catley, is having a system for gathering, collecting, consolidating, and reporting your data, whether you choose one framework, several, or none. “With data intelligence and analytics tools, you can slice and dice it whatever way you want.”</p>
  <p>To be useful for decision-making, data also needs to be consistent, comparable, and reliable, adds Neil Stewart, director of corporate outreach at the Value Reporting Foundation, an international nonprofit working on creating a globally accepted sustainability reporting system through both Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards and the International Integrated Reporting Framework.</p>
  <h2 id="sustainability-is-not-unmapped-territory">Sustainability is not unmapped territory</h2>
  <p>Companies are used to leveraging data to constantly tweak and refine their operations for better performance. The Nows’ better outcomes and anticipation of higher profits suggest that using data to shape their sustainable business strategy is a variation on that familiar theme: even a little data is enough, as long as it’s good enough to see the results from making even small changes.</p>
  <p>Pursuing sustainability is similar enough to other performance improvement initiatives that, as Stewart notes, companies often use the same tools, processes, controls, and even the same people. “It’s about overlaying financial data approaches on – and bringing the discipline and rigor of financial data and processes to – sustainability data and processes.”</p>
  <p>The Value Reporting Foundation has found that one of the things <a href="https://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Alliance-CID-Paper_FINAL.pdf">investors now look for</a> in disclosures is a company’s willingness to start taking action on ESG issues. That’s because they believe that, as Stewart puts it, “Starting small, locally, or incrementally still moves the needle.” He also predicts that the more data companies collect on sustainability, the more they will agree on definitions and metrics, which in turn will help them make meaningful decisions about what to measure and report.</p>

    <div>
      <div>There’s no way to tackle every sustainability issue at once, so figure out one area that is material to your company in which to make measurable progress.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Catley suggests that telling customers, investors, and other stakeholders that you’re gathering and acting on sustainability data is a key part of the process, especially given the Nows’ experience of realizing tangible benefits. As with other potentially material changes to the way you manage your business, Catley says, “The way you let people know that you’re trying to improve is to set ambitious but achievable goals, track your progress toward those goals, and if you’re doing well, shout it.”</p>
  <p>The SAP Insights survey found that the Nows are more likely than other respondents to highlight their environmental progress, not only in corporate sustainability reports and on their websites but also in integrated reports to shareholders (which capture the impact of environmental actions on long-term value creation) and in their marketing materials and press releases. This suggests that the Nows’ experience using sustainability data makes them more confident in its <a href="https://news.sap.com/2021/09/converging-stakeholder-capitalism/">relevance to key stakeholders</a> such as investors and customers.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-start-with-sustainability-data">How to start with sustainability data</h2>
  <p>If your company is just getting started with sustainability data gathering and reporting, the first step is to establish where you are now and what your stakeholders want to see, Catley says. There’s no way to tackle every sustainability issue at once, so figure out one area that is material to your company in which to make measurable progress.</p>
  <p>If you’re a manufacturer, maybe you will decide to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that result from shipping your products. Determine what data you would need to understand your emissions and measure progress toward your goals, such as fuel use, costs, and carbon footprint of different modes of transportation.</p>
  <p>Once you’ve gathered enough data to establish your current state and compare it meaningfully to potential alternatives, you can begin to develop a strategy. For example, look at where your customers are located and what they order and when, and ask yourself what mode of transportation offers the best combination of price and environmental impact. You also might be able to identify customers who are willing to accept shipping that’s slightly slower but significantly greener or to create new markets by promoting your goal of carbon-neutral delivery.</p>
  <p>Ideas like these could generate new value, whether through cost savings, growth, or both. When your conclusions point you in a positive direction, create a pilot project and monitor its results. If they seem promising, scale up from there. Then repeat the entire process in another area in which you think you can improve.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="a-path-to-a-more-sustainable-business-paved-with-data">A path to a more sustainable business, paved with data</h2>
  <p>The Nows’ experiences suggest that more attention to data creates better results. Committing to concrete KPIs like reducing your energy bills by X% each year or becoming carbon-neutral by 2030 helps define the data you need to meet those sustainability goals and also keeps you focused on how to apply that data in ways that contribute materially to business results.</p>
  <p>This process is circular, not linear. The Nows are a good example: Instead of waiting for perfect sustainability data, they act on the data they have. The more they do, the more data they gather, which helps them to both improve the quality of their data and drive even more useful and relevant actions over time.</p>
  <p>As early movers that act despite having some insecurity about their data, the Nows are establishing the rules for their industries about the data that matters to sustainability and how best to collect it. As early adopters often do, the Nows are bearing the burden of building the proverbial plane as they fly it, but they also get to create <a href="/research/social-impact-in-business">customer expectations about sustainability and value</a>. That positions them to meet those expectations sooner. And, as the survey results show, their ability to act faster is helping them become more profitable and successful.</p>
  <p>In other words, the lesson offered by the Nows when it comes to sustainability data is that data doesn’t have to be perfect to deliver great benefits for both the planet and the balance sheet.</p>

  <p>But in a recent SAP Insights global survey of business professionals who are knowledgeable about their organization’s sustainability goals, actions, and reporting methods, respondents tell us that most of their companies are taking at least some steps toward greater environmental sustainability – and that the more effort companies put toward that goal, the more successful they expect their performance to be. In fact, we found a significant minority of respondents who say that environmental sustainability is already financially material<sup>*</sup> to their businesses and another group that believes it will become imminent in the near future.</p>
  <p>The Material Now group, or the <em>Nows</em>, make up 17% of our survey respondents. Leaders at these companies not only see clearly that the fortunes of their businesses are inevitably linked to those of the planet; they’re finding ways to make that link pay off. They are transforming their companies <em>and</em> achieving better business results than the companies represented by the remaining 83% of our respondents.</p>
  <p>Even among this 83%, however, we found some respondents who have taken off their blinders: 22% think sustainability will be material to their businesses within five years. This group, which we call the <em>Imminents</em>, says their companies are more likely to be taking action on sustainability – and to see business performance gains – than the remaining 61% of respondents, whom we refer to as the <em>Laters</em>. (See Figure 1.)</p>
  <p>Our survey data does not <em>prove</em> cause and effect between materiality and business success. However, across all respondents, there is a strong correlation between the two. And this strong correlation suggests that when business leaders look at value creation through the lens of sustainability, they find opportunities to grow and improve performance.</p>

  <p>The sooner that respondents believe sustainability will be material to their companies’ operations, the more likely they expect their companies to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>See higher revenue for the current fiscal year</li>
    <li>Consider sustainability a high investment priority</li>
    <li>Collect data about sustainability for a longer period</li>
    <li>Use sustainability data to inform more decisions</li>
    <li>Be more satisfied with the quality of sustainability data</li>
    <li>Distribute responsibility for action on sustainability more broadly within the organization</li>
    <li>Have a greater understanding of the positive correlations between sustainability and profitability as well as sustainability and competitiveness</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Nows – the 17% of respondents who believe environmental issues are already materially affecting their companies’ finances and operations – stand out because they are significantly ahead of even the Imminents in each of the areas listed above. They also have more committed leadership. Our survey shows that the Nows’ plans to incorporate sustainability into business operations are driven from the top. The Now leaders see the need for change and drive it forward, while other respondents are doing less and moving more slowly.</p>

  <p>The Now respondents say their companies also have more data than the Imminents and the Laters about the environmental effects of their businesses, and they use it better. They see fewer barriers to action. They invest more, both in money and in people, to support sustainability. And, crucially, they consider sustainability an essential part of their business strategy.</p>
  <p>In addition, the Nows are more optimistic about their companies’ strategy: They are 11% more likely than the Imminents and Laters to expect that environmental sustainability will increase long-term revenues and profits.</p>
  <p>That’s not to say what the Now companies are doing is easy. Our survey found that pursuing sustainability involves a complex system of business drivers so intertwined that difficult trade-offs could result. But even this could work to the Nows’ advantage, allowing them to widen the competitive gap between themselves and companies that are postponing those decisions.</p>
  <p>The complexity of acting on sustainability is lost on no one. But the correlation that we see between action and business success should be both a signal and a call to action for companies that are unsure about or resistant to making sustainability part of their business strategy and operations. Financial materiality for sustainability is already here: The question is no longer when to act, but how.</p>
  <h3 id="motivations-to-act">Motivations to act</h3>
  <p>Some major companies have already made <a href="/resources/sustainability-strategy-profits-follow-purpose">sustainability</a> not just a pledge but a strategy. U.S. automaker General Motors has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/business/general-motors-electric-cars.html">committed</a> to manufacturing only electric cars, vans, and SUVs by 2035. Meanwhile, German automaker Volkswagen has already made big changes to try to win market share early in the shift to electric. It will transform the bulk of its fleet – more than 30 models – to electric power within the next four years.</p>
  <p>Such strategic bets aren’t limited to the auto industry. In 2020, investment giant BlackRock made sustainability its new standard for investing its US$2.7 trillion portfolio.</p>
  <p>The big marquee names are no accident. Our survey found that the Now respondents are more likely to be from large (revenues of $750 million or more) companies. Some reasons may be that the Nows are aware that their companies have extensive effects on the environment and that larger companies have greater economies of scale and the discretionary budget to measure and mitigate those effects.</p>

  <h2 id="a-different-mindset">A different mindset</h2>
  <p>Across the board, the Now respondents think about sustainability differently from Imminents and Laters. The most notable differences lie in their companies’ motivations for pursuing sustainability, their methods for doing so, and what they expect the results to be. Notably, their approach seems to hinge on the actions (or lack thereof) of company leaders.</p>
  <p>To illustrate: We asked respondents to choose up to five factors (from a list of 12) that motivate their companies to take environmental action. From that short list, we asked them to rank each factor in order of importance.</p>
  <p>Among the Nows, the most frequently chosen number one motivator for their companies to take environmental action is CEO and board commitment, followed by government regulations, the company’s stated purpose, commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and revenue and profit growth opportunities. These are primarily philosophical, future-oriented drivers that suggest the Now respondents’ companies are being proactive about environmental consequences and consciously connecting them to business outcomes.</p>
  <p>Both the Imminents and the Laters say their companies are more influenced by traditional business priorities than the Now organizations. For example, the Laters are more likely than the Nows to be motivated by factors such as revenue and profit growth opportunities, whereas the Imminents are more likely than the Nows to be motivated by customer demand and opportunities to develop new offerings. (See Figure 2.)</p>
  <p>While the Nows say their companies have decided there are strategic benefits to moving quickly, the data doesn’t tell us why – or why the Imminents and Laters are slower to act. It may be that the latter two groups think that their companies are deliberately taking a “fast follower” approach, letting others shoulder the risk of experimenting with new solutions.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Imminents and Laters, the Nows say their leaders have assigned accountability for actions that improve the environment to 21% more roles across the organization.</p>
  <p>Forty-eight percent of the Nows and Imminents say their companies are aware of environmental actions taken by their business partners and suppliers, compared to just 39% of the Laters. This is presumably because the Nows and Imminents want their companies’ own commitments to that goal to be reflected throughout their supply chains.</p>
  <p>A company’s investments are the clearest indicator of its strategies and goals. The Nows are more likely than the Imminents and Laters to say that their companies are directing investments toward improving the environment, and Nows are more likely to be planning to increase those investments.</p>
  <p>Taken together, the most frequently cited top priority investment for all respondents we surveyed is mitigating climate change, cited by 17%.</p>
  <p>Interestingly, the next three highest priorities – use of recycled, reclaimed, or renewable materials; reducing solid and hazardous waste through recycling and reuse; and improving resource availability through products designed for reuse, repair, and remanufacture – are key components of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability/what-is-circular-economy.html">circular economy</a>. That together they are a priority for 40% of respondents suggests a high interest in circular business methods.</p>
  <p>However, the Nows say their companies consider every one of these circular-model investments a higher priority than the Imminents and the Laters do. The gap between the percentages of each group prioritizing each category suggests their companies’ relative commitment. (See Figure 3.)</p>
  <p>In addition, 44% of the Nows say their companies intend to increase spending on sustainability investments over the next three years. The Imminents are close at 41%, but the Laters are far behind, with just 30% saying their companies plan to increase their spending.</p>
  <p>Indeed, 19% of the Laters say their companies intend to <em>decrease</em> their investment in sustainability or have no plans to invest in it, compared to 13% of the Imminents and just 9% of the Nows.</p>

  <h3 id="we-think-that-the-now-companies-are-more-likely-to-prioritize-environmental-sustainability-because-their-leaders-are-better-systems-thinkers">We think that the Now companies are more likely to prioritize environmental sustainability because their leaders are better systems thinkers.</h3>
  <p>They understand that individual issues such as climate change are not independent but are part of dynamic, complex systems that constantly interact with each other. Systems thinkers know that outcomes are determined by the interconnected elements of the larger system that their companies are part of, and they prioritize long-term value creation over short-term problem solving.</p>
  <p>For the Now respondents’ companies, the environment is another important piece of an interconnected system. This can be seen in the fact that they’ve been collecting more data about their business and its environmental impact for a longer period of time. This data gives them the visibility to anticipate better business outcomes, which implies that they recognize the value of sustainability data in driving strategic and operational decisions.</p>
  <p>Companies with more data tend to have a more holistic view of their business, which gives them more granular insights into the trade-offs they can make to deliver better overall outcomes. Data about sustainability is part of this broader picture; the Now companies’ wide array of data helps them see the well-being of the planet as not only intertwined with but inherent to the well-being of their businesses.</p>
  <p>The consumer products industry offers an example of how a data-supported approach to sustainability might play out. Many consumer products are packaged the same way, whether they’re sold in Stockholm or Shanghai. However, as governments begin to regulate single-use packaging for environmental reasons, a packaging design may generate different costs and benefits depending on where it’s used.</p>
  <p>With good data, a company can explore the financial effects of creating unique packaging for individual markets to attract more customers, pursue zero waste aspirations, or lower the costs of following local environmental regulations. The company would even be able to predict the most cost-efficient timeframe for developing new packaging rather than letting regulations force the issue.</p>
  <p>However, even the most comprehensive data sets aren’t perfect. Among all respondents, 79% report being dissatisfied with the quality of the data they collect about environmental sustainability. The pain isn’t evenly distributed; the Nows report the least dissatisfaction, followed by the Imminents and the Laters. (See Figure 4.)</p>

  </p>
  <p><em>Figure 4: Who's not happy with data now?</em></p>
  <p>Although all groups share common complaints about data quality, the Now respondents’ companies are less likely to experience them. The Nows are also less likely than the Imminents or the Laters to lack confidence that the data is complete and covers the required scope, to want data to be collected more frequently, to need faster access, and to want more transparency in the calculations or assumptions used to make estimates. Though these barriers are all about data, they are as rooted in business processes as they are in technology. (See Figure 5.)</p>
  <p>There are many possible reasons why the Nows say they are more satisfied with data quality around environmental sustainability. One may be that they say they have more data: 44% say they’ve been collecting relevant data for more than five years, compared to 34% of the Laters and just 20% of the Imminents. This gives the Nows a larger and deeper database from which to derive insights they trust and can act on to achieve more useful and predictable results.</p>
  <p>However, given the extent of dissatisfaction with data quality, it’s not surprising that <em>all</em> respondents say that the most significant barriers to acting on environmental issues are data-dependent uncertainties.</p>

  <p>They all say that it’s not clear how their companies should embed sustainability into processes and systems. Nor is there clarity about how to align their efforts with business strategy or confirm ROI.</p>
  <p>However, the Nows say their companies see fewer barriers to action. In fact, the Nows are far more likely than either the Imminents or the Laters to say that they have no specific barriers.</p>
  <p>The Imminent and Later respondents say that their companies are hampered by an absence of leadership at the top. For example, they’re significantly more likely than the Nows to say that environmental sustainability lacks support from senior management, that it’s not a business priority, that there’s organizational resistance to acting, or that they don’t know where to start. (See Figure 6.)</p>
  <p>We didn’t uncover a definitive reason why the Nows find it easier to overcome the obstacles to acting sustainably. It’s possible that because the Nows have more enthusiastic leadership, more widespread accountability, and higher motivation to act, they’re less daunted by any individual barriers.</p>

  <h3 id="in-examining-what-differentiates-the-nows-from-the-rest-three-things-stand-out">In examining what differentiates the Nows from the rest, three things stand out:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data matters.</strong> The Nows are more likely than the Imminents or Laters to apply their environmental sustainability data to a strong degree to their operational and strategic decisions. (See Figure 7.)</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability is not a drag</strong>. The Nows are also much more likely to believe that taking action to improve the environment will increase their competitiveness as well as increase long-term profit. (See Figure 8.)</li>
    <li><strong>Leaders are leading</strong>. Financial statements alone are not telling the Nows to act – their leaders are. The leadership of the Now companies understand that a healthy environment contributes to the performance of the business and have decided to embrace sustainability for benefit.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Figure 7: Does sustainability guide your strategy?</em></p>
  <p>Of course, believing in something isn’t enough to make it true. When respondents believe environmental factors already affect their company’s performance, or will do so sooner rather than later, they are more likely to use environmental data to inform decision-making. This suggests that the Nows are taking a broader, more long-term view that has led them to address sustainability, even though they may not see immediate results.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the Laters face a classic dilemma: If they have perfectly good revenue streams from doing things that don’t account for the environment, they probably see barriers to change as being too high. For example, shifting from single-use to reusable containers will require massive infrastructure changes for manufacturers and retailers. The handful of innovators in this area have yet to deliver solutions at the necessary scale.</p>
  <p>But in light of inescapable and increasingly urgent research demonstrating the damage wrought by environmental issues such as climate change and resource scarcity, we were frankly surprised that the Laters constitute such a large majority: 61% of respondents. They are saying they don’t believe environmental sustainability will be material to their financial results for five years or more.</p>

  <p><em>Figure 8: Sustainability sustains competitiveness and profits</em></p>
  <p>The data clearly shows that all respondents see sustainability as a major strategic and operational challenge. It may be that the Laters have decided to wait until meaningful carbon taxes, supply chain regulations, and other legal requirements affect their bottom line, which could be years into the future.</p>
  <p>But after years in which public interest, political will, and business response weren’t unified, we’ve reached a moment when they are. Companies that once only aspired to make incremental annual cuts to their carbon emissions are now committing to science-based targets and cutting emissions by half, in less than a decade. Many are going much further by putting sustainability at the core of their business strategy. It’s a big leap, one that requires believing that sustainability is crucial to future competitiveness.</p>
  <p>Though the balance sheet may not always say it yet, sustainability is already material to companies. And viewing it that way won’t just help save the planet, it will also improve business performance – sooner than many business leaders think.</p>

        <p>Investors, consumers, and executives alike are seeking precise ways to express what sustainability looks like in data and dollars.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The next time you stop for a latte at your local Starbucks, you might notice <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2020/01/07/starbucks-non-dairy-plant-based-drinks-menu-2020/2828507001/">more non-dairy options</a> like soy, almond, oat, and coconut milks on the menu. Delicious as they are, their presence isn’t entirely a response to customer demand. As part of an initiative to cut its environmental impacts <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2021/starbucks-announces-coffee-specific-environmental-goals/">in half by 2030</a>, the global coffee giant recently began to track and report on greenhouse gas emissions across its operations. In the process, it discovered that dairy products are the company's largest source of CO2, accounting for <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/can-starbucks-save-the-planet-by-cutting-dairy-activists-and-investors-respond-2020-01-21">more than one-fifth</a> of its carbon footprint. So as it brews up future business strategies, Starbucks is now mixing in a greater emphasis on plant-based alternatives.</p>
  <p>Companies need to track and report on various aspects of business performance in granular detail, both for compliance purposes and to guide strategic decision-making. In the past, that reporting focused predominantly on financial metrics. However, as today’s regulators, investors, and consumers become increasingly concerned about societal and environmental well-being, companies are looking for ways to incorporate <a href="/resources/sustainability-strategy-profits-follow-purpose">holistic sustainability metrics</a> into their business reporting.</p>
  <p>Some companies are already reporting on supply chain transparency, carbon footprints, and other environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues of their own accord. These moves are partly due to investor and consumer demand, but they are also a way to make a virtue of necessity as more regulatory bodies begin to require companies to report on how they’re advancing positive ESG impacts and mitigating negative ones. Business groups and academia are providing further motivation by exploring ways to express sustainability metrics in financial terms.</p>
  <p>The ultimate goal of this more holistic approach to reporting is to get companies to take their environmental and social impacts into account with every business decision throughout the value chain so that they can stay within the <a href="/blogs/technology-for-biology-preserving-biodiversity">planetary boundaries</a> and <a href="https://embeddingproject.org/resources/the-social-foundation-a-safe-and-just-place-for-humanity">social foundations</a> that support civilization itself. One key way to encourage them to adopt this mindset is to help them connect the dots between increasing attention to ESG impacts and improving business performance. But we’re not there yet.</p>
  <p>Unlike financial reporting, we have no universally agreed-upon standards for ESG metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs), so organizations have no baselines or benchmarks with which to turn reporting into meaningful action. It’s one thing to commit your company to measuring its carbon footprint and cutting it in half by the end of the decade. It’s another thing to determine whether that 50% reduction is enough to contribute meaningfully to keeping global warming below the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/business-ambition-for-1-5c">1.5°C</a> <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">threshold</a> that the scientific community says is necessary to avoid climate catastrophe.</p>
  <p>It’s harder still to gauge a company’s progress toward that science-based target against that of other companies. And since even the record drops in carbon emissions during the global COVID-19 pandemic are turning into a <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021">recovery rebound</a> expected to push emissions to a new high, meaningful action can’t wait. If companies hope to fend off environmental and societal crises that could threaten their survival, they need to push toward making more holistic reporting possible so that they can begin steering their strategies in a new direction quickly and effectively.</p>
  <h2 id="broadening-the-view-of-business">Broadening the view of business</h2>
  <p>The same global economy that has delivered tremendous financial growth and value has also created massive negative impacts, such as forcing governments to starve public services like education and transportation to support ever-growing needs for <a href="/resources/circularity-taking-trash-out-of-global-economy">waste disposal</a>, accelerating the global climate emergency, and degrading the natural systems that support human life. As the world wakes up to the realization that it’s impossible to continue “business as usual,” creating value for shareholders will no longer be enough for a company to be considered worthy of existing.</p>
  <p>To remain relevant and accepted, companies will have to be willing to take responsibility and action for mitigating their negative impacts and increasing their positive impacts. And to be effective at doing that, they will need to measure those impacts and compare them to both what other companies are doing and what needs to be done. That calls for an accounting framework that is actionable, scalable, and standardized across organizations so that stakeholders, including investors, employees, local communities, and governmental bodies, can understand, communicate, and make decisions about sustainability consistently over time.</p>
  <p>Two factors are driving interest in such a framework, says Neil Stewart, director of corporate outreach for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB): business leaders want greater transparency into all kinds of KPIs to benchmark and improve performance, while investors are demanding details about ESG issues to inform their investment decisions.</p>

  <h2 id="the-challenge-of-holistic-sustainability-reporting">The challenge of holistic sustainability reporting</h2>
  <p>Investors are eagerly seeking out sustainable companies. In 2020, investors poured US$27.4 billion into U.S.-based exchange-traded funds focused on ESG, doubling the size of this niche, according to FactSet data <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-pile-into-etfs-devoted-to-socially-responsible-esg-11608114604">cited</a> by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. Even so, it’s not always clear what’s guiding investors’ choices since there are no agreed-upon standards for reporting on ESG issues that enable companies to indicate how sustainable they are or in what ways.</p>
  <p>That leaves companies struggling to determine the true social and environmental costs of their businesses. Financial measurements alone don’t reflect those costs, so they aren’t generally incorporated into performance reports. The exception is when there’s an actual fee involved, such as measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions to comply with regulations in <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon">40 countries</a> worldwide that impose a carbon tax based on each ton of CO2 that a business emits within the relevant geographic area.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div>Leaders want greater transparency into all kinds of KPIs to improve performance, while investors are demanding details about ESG issues to inform their investment decisions.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To take on the challenge of expanding corporate reporting to include sustainability metrics, some of the world’s leading universities have embedded sustainability initiatives into their finance, economics, and/or accounting departments.</p>
  <p>In the United States alone, Harvard Business School’s <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/impact-weighted-accounts/Pages/default.aspx">Impact-Weighted Accounts Project</a> is developing a way to assign monetary value to ESG impacts, as is the <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/centers-of-research/center-sustainable-business/research">Center for Sustainable Business</a> at New York University’s Stern School of Business, which has created a methodology to prove the financial ROI of sustainability efforts. The <a href="https://cbey.yale.edu/programs/yale-initiative-on-sustainable-finance-yisf">Yale Initiative on Sustainable Finance</a> at the Yale Center for Business and the Environment is exploring how investors can better integrate ESG factors into investment decisions, while the <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability-initiative/aggregate-confusion-project">Aggregate Confusion Project</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management is focused on improving the quality of ESG measurements in the financial sector.</p>
  <p>In the UK, the <a href="https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership</a> promotes and directs capital to sustainable business models. The <a href="https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research/sustainable-finance/">Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme</a> is responsible for the key concept of “climate-related stranded assets,” that is, assets that have unexpectedly or prematurely lost value or become liabilities due to environment-related factors. The Imperial College Business School in London has partnered with Singapore Management University to set up the <a href="https://www.singaporegreenfinance.com/">Singapore Green Finance Centre</a> to drive sustainable investing in Asia. And interest continues to spread worldwide. Each of these institutions is among the 27 research universities across North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region that make up the <a href="https://sustainablefinancealliance.org/">Global Research Alliance for Sustainable Finance and Investment</a>.</p>
  <p>Organizations outside of academia are also working on the challenge, including <a href="https://www.value-balancing.com/">Value Balancing Alliance</a> (VBA), a group of 21 multinational companies developing metrics for measuring and comparing the value of contributions made by businesses to society, the economy, and the environment. In 2020, VBA ran a pilot program across 11 companies in seven industries that focused on supply chains and operations, testing specific indicators and translating nonfinancial metrics like environmental and social impacts into comparable financial terms. The May 2021 report on the <a href="https://www.value-balancing.com/en/press/new-sustainability-measurement-methodology-developed-by-the-value-balancing-alliance-successfully-tested-for-the-first-time-2.html">results</a> shows that the VBA methodology can be used successfully to compare the long-term value contribution of companies.</p>
  <p>“Investors have started actively bringing up ESG issues and sustainability, which is a dramatic advance from five or six years ago,” says Sonja Haut, head of strategic measurement and materiality at the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis, a founding member of VBA. “Now we need to standardize valuation around impacts so we can articulate to investors the value we bring to society. What we’ve learned so far is that impact valuation is relevant and compelling as a way of looking at an individual company, that it can be scaled, and that it makes sense across different geographies. Now we need to understand how well we’re doing, how we’re performing against peers, and how to benefit more from our insights.”</p>
  <p>While this work is in process, though, most companies are still trying to determine what to measure, never mind how to act on that data beyond sharing it for the sake of transparency. “Many companies are pumping out hundreds of pages of disclosures but not yet changing their strategy to align their business with ESG factors,” says Stewart. “That’s the next step.”</p>

  <h2 id="connecting-sustainability-metrics-to-performance">Connecting sustainability metrics to performance</h2>
  <p>A handful of companies have taken the next step by developing internal ESG metrics to monitor their own progress. Andrew Winston, coauthor of the sustainability strategy book <em><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Green+to+Gold%3A+How+Smart+Companies+Use+Environmental+Strategy+to+Innovate%2C+Create+Value%2C+and+Build+Competitive+Advantage-p-9780470393741">Green to Gold</a>: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage</em>, offers the examples of consumer goods giant Unilever, which announced in 2020 that it would report on the carbon footprints of all of its suppliers, and luxury fashion holding company Kering, which is using impact reporting to increase transparency into the sourcing of key materials. However, Winston points out that there’s no easy way for these companies to compare their sustainability against each other’s.</p>
  <p>To be fair, financial metrics also fall short in this regard. “Companies can play with what cash means on their balance sheets,” Winston notes. “A retailer doesn’t use the same metrics as a mining company. So it’s not realistic to expect the metrics to be perfect.”</p>
  <p>Still, everyone agrees on what cash is, and there are several established requirements for reporting on it. That isn’t necessarily true for ESG metrics. The <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">Greenhouse Gas Protocol</a> is the world’s most widely used standard for accounting and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, describing in detail how they can and should be measured along the value chain. But it isn’t mandatory. Companies can opt to use it in whole or in part or to use other industry benchmarks. And as a result, even if a company uses the best technology currently available to measure its greenhouse gas emissions in detail, it is still likely to have gaps in its ability to assess how its CO2 output compares to its peers or to the progress necessary to reduce global emissions.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div>Companies have yet to adopt potential science-based KPIs that would establish targets for managing water use, protecting biodiversity, or eliminating manufacturing waste.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There’s also the question of how to assign significance to things that are measured. It’s possible to measure the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. But to determine the true meaning of that metric, it’s necessary to trace the “impact pathway” by which higher levels of CO2 increase global temperatures, which make sea levels rise, and subsequently force people to abandon homes on the shoreline. Only then can you assign a monetary value, or the “<a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/social-cost-carbon-101/">social cost</a>,” to the damage caused by putting one ton of CO2 into the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>That barely scratches the surface. We’re used to the idea of measuring and reducing carbon emissions, but there are other things that need to be measured to capture the true holistic costs of doing business, and we don’t know how to do that. Companies have yet to adopt potential science-based KPIs that would establish targets for managing water use, protecting biodiversity, or eliminating manufacturing waste. And if we don’t know what our targets are, we have no context for taking action. “You could cut your company’s water use by 20%, but that isn’t a relevant benchmark if your facility is in a watershed where you need to cut your water use by 80% to prevent drought conditions,” Winston explains.</p>
  <p>This, too, increases the urgency of the push to establish globally accepted standards.</p>

  <h2 id="making-strides-toward-standards">Making strides toward standards</h2>
  <p>As of 2016, there were around 400 sustainability <a href="https://www.carrotsandsticks.net/reporting-instruments/?status=Forthcoming&#x26;status=Current">reporting instruments</a> in 64 countries. Only 65% of them were mandatory, and those applied predominantly to state-owned or publicly traded companies, particularly larger ones. For example, the UK requires publicly traded companies to report annually on greenhouse gas emissions as well as specific requirements for diversity and human rights, and India’s Securities and Exchange Board requires the top 100 publicly traded companies in that country to produce annual Business Responsibility Reports. Another notable example is the European Union (EU)’s Directive on Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity, which requires certain businesses to report on material environmental, social, and employee-related matters, including corruption and human rights performance.</p>
  <p>The EU is also developing a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/eu-taxonomy-sustainable-activities_en">taxonomy</a> of corporate activities with detailed specifications that a company must meet before it can position itself or its products as “sustainable.” At a time when rising investor demand for socially and environmentally conscious products and services makes it tempting for companies to indulge in “greenwashing,” this regulation is intended to keep false claims of sustainability out of the financial markets. Instead, it will direct investors to companies that can credibly verify that they meet the EU taxonomy’s standards.</p>
  <p>Other organizations are also developing standards with an eye toward widespread adoption. The <a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/">Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures</a>, comprised of 31 members from across the G20 nations and created by the global Financial Stability Board to improve and increase reporting on climate-related financial information, has developed recommendations. So have the <a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/">Global Reporting Initiative</a> (GRI), an organization whose widely used ESG standards cover topics such as human rights and waste disposal, and the <a href="https://www.sustainabilityconsortium.org/">Sustainability Consortium</a>, a nonprofit helping the consumer goods industry create more transparent, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/what-is-a-sustainable-supply-chain.html">sustainable supply chains</a>.</p>

      <div>Smart organizations recognize that the global economy requires a global approach for consistency across jurisdictions, and they are watching as one continues to emerge.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Another noteworthy player is SASB, which was founded in 2011 and released its first set of standards in 2014, with an update at the end of 2018. SASB winnowed down which disclosure topics and metrics are most critical in <a href="https://www.sasb.org/standards/download/">77 different industries</a>, such as appliance manufacturing and marine transportation, to identify the subset of ESG issues most material to financial performance in each specific industry. However, the SASB standards do not look in the opposite direction: how the company’s actions impact the environment and society.</p>
  <p>The proliferation of and enthusiasm for ESG reporting standards and frameworks are promising, but as Haut points out, “having lots of standards that no one can agree on is essentially the same as having no standards at all.” Smart organizations recognize that the global economy requires a global approach for consistency across jurisdictions, and they are watching as one continues to emerge.</p>

  <p>In 2020, consolidation among standard-setting bodies and framework providers began to accelerate. SASB and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) announced their plans to merge to create the Value Reporting Foundation. The “Big Five” organizations for sustainability and integrated reporting – SASB, IIRC, CDP Worldwide (previously the Carbon Disclosure Project), the Climate Disclosure Standards Board, and the GRI – created a <a href="https://www.integratedreporting.org/resource/statement-of-intent-to-work-together-towards-comprehensive-corporate-reporting/">joint coalition</a> to unify standards. The World Economic Forum’s International Business Council has proposed a common, core set of metrics and recommended disclosures for its members to align their reporting on ESG matters, and its Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics project has <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_VBA_Joint_Statement.pdf">announced</a> that it will work to align its performance measurement and reporting metrics with those of VBA.</p>
  <p>In March 2021, the 200-plus companies comprising the World Business Council for Sustainable Development declared in a vision statement for 2050 that companies should work with governments to push for standardization and regulation. And looking ahead, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group and the global International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation are also tackling the challenge. The IFRS Foundation’s Sustainability Standards Board has the potential to become a global “center of gravity” for the effort.</p>
  <p>As with other regulations, the goal is to require companies to report on their actions and provide them with goals and benchmarks. Eventually, we may see penalties for noncompliance to ensure both a level playing field and a more sustainable world. After all, it’s hard to run a profitable business with a prospective customer base that’s struggling to survive famine, floods, heat waves, disease, and other negative environmental and societal impacts.</p>

  <h2 id="navigating-by-the-data">Navigating by the data</h2>
  <p>Stewart acknowledges that many companies aren’t yet at the point where they can draw a line between more holistic reporting and more sustainable business strategy around operations and risk management, for example. As he puts it, there’s still a gap between potential and use, and that gap may still take some time to close.</p>
  <p>Winston is more blunt about the challenge that many companies face. “The holy grail has always been to have such complete and robust measurements of energy use and carbon footprint that you can easily allocate it to each individual customer and product and make changes accordingly,” he says. “But we’re not close to that, even though it’s felt for years like it’s about to be here. It’s shocking to me how many companies don’t even have a very good handle on their energy use and are asking their different facilities to input utility bills on a spreadsheet!”</p>
  <p>On the other hand, some sophisticated companies already understand that sustainability goals and financial goals are inextricably linked. “They know it doesn’t have to pay off immediately,” Winston says. “You make investments and do research and development and, instead of reporting on quarterly performance, you write one complete story that captures long-term value.”</p>
  <p>The more data a company has about its social and environmental footprint, he adds, the more it can use that data to achieve goals about shrinking and greening the footprint of each individual product or service throughout its lifecycle. In the process, the data will also reveal information about sources and suppliers that will help the company optimize its supply chain, achieve better outcomes, and share best practices that result in systematic change.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/digitization-vs-digitalization.html">Digitalization</a> is critical to helping companies manage their data around ESG impacts. Companies already rely on digital technologies to process vast amounts of enterprise and supply chain data, automate key actions, and generate real-time insights. These same technologies also drive compliance reporting and make it possible to embed insights and decision-making into core business processes, seamlessly weaving together operations, analytics, and strategic planning. More integrated reporting won’t force companies to reinvent the wheel; it will just require them to incorporate more types and sources of information into the data-driven processes they already use.</p>
  <p>Winston predicts that Unilever’s decision to start gathering and publishing carbon footprint data from all of its suppliers will do more than just identify areas where they can reduce their own CO2 emissions. By providing that information to consumers, Unilever enables them to make their own sustainability-driven choices about which products to buy to reduce their own energy consumption – for example, by choosing detergent that works well with smaller amounts of cooler water.</p>
  <p>Another example is Kering, the holding company that owns some of the world’s best-known fashion brands. Several of these brands, such as Gucci, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, are famed for their leather goods, but producing leather is an extremely resource-intensive process that includes raising the source animals and processing their hides. Impact reporting is helping Kering identify ways to increase sustainability throughout its supply chain without diluting its brands’ reputations for impeccable quality.</p>

  <p>As a pharmaceutical company, Novartis had metrics to report on its environmental impact but little way of indicating the positive social impacts of the medicines it produces. Working with health economists, the company developed a framework, tested it in two countries, and then scaled it company-wide. Haut says it’s now part of the company’s regular disclosures, both at the corporate level and among country-specific leadership teams, who use it for insights, stakeholder engagements, and initiatives for providing services to underserved communities.</p>
  <p>Novartis has also begun to measure and report on the social impact of employee pay, including how many jobs the company creates, where, and what kind; the quality of the jobs; and how the company’s salaries and wages contribute to gross domestic product, both globally and in the specific countries where it does business.</p>
  <p>“Impact valuation has a transformative power in giving people a different appreciation of what value can be,” Haut says. “[At] Novartis, we haven’t yet been able to correlate our impact data with our productivity, but we’ve had instances where more integrated reporting has persuaded external stakeholders to let us get or keep access to a market, so we’re definitely seeing use cases emerge.”</p>

  <h2 id="moving-ahead">Moving ahead</h2>
  <p>The point of including ESG metrics in business reporting isn’t just to gather more data for its own sake or even for regulatory compliance. When you have data, you can identify what you’re doing wrong – or right – to improve company performance. Once we’ve arrived at the end of the arduous journey to build a standardized reporting framework, there’s no need to keep refining every KPI down to its component aspects. Instead, that’s a sign that it’s time to ask every company in the world to report on that agreed-upon KPI and begin building benchmarks that drive comparisons and action.</p>
  <p>The VBA pilot project suggests what it’s going to take to make that leap. First, internal stakeholders from the C-suite down need to be convinced that reporting on sustainability is as important as reporting on profit and loss. Second, those stakeholders and managers need to play an active role in determining how to analyze the resulting data to inform decisions. And finally, business users need to understand the data so that they can spot the insights that matter and that will make a difference to performance.</p>
  <p>Investors and customers are becoming increasingly vigorous in demanding that business take action on <a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/social-impact-in-business.html">key sustainability issues</a>. To satisfy them, companies will have no choice but to report en masse on social and environmental impacts and announce what they plan to do about them. That will require them to coordinate on these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Agreeing on metrics</li>
    <li>Determining how to capture them</li>
    <li>Taking measurements</li>
    <li>Understanding whether the data is relevant</li>
    <li>Using the data to generate insights</li>
    <li>Using those insights to drive the decision-making process</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Following these steps may not pay off immediately, but, as Stewart points out, they will in the long term. More holistic reporting that incorporates ESG metrics will help companies identify risks, like the inability to access necessary resources because of climate change, and it will help them spot opportunities, like creating jobs and demand for products in an underserved community.</p>
  <p>“Sustainability risks are material to value,” he says. “By managing them over the long term, you improve performance by reducing the costs of resources and operations, minimizing poor outcomes, improving efficiency, and increasing resilience.”</p>
  <p>Transparency triggers actions, and right now, companies don’t have the transparency to make informed decisions and act on them. But by allowing them to connect their actions to broader goals rather than mere profit, they can be good employers, good neighbors, and good global citizens who are supporting the transition to a more just and less polluted world. And that will be good for everyone.</p>

        <p>How leaders can reconfigure their offerings to place sustainability at the core of their business.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Decades after the company he founded made the transformation to using sustainable materials, Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface, remembered the realization “like a spear in the chest.” The large manufacturer of commercial flooring needed a higher purpose, a mission that included chasing profits but went beyond. The <a href="https://www.interface.com/US/en-US/sustainability/our-history-en_US#557997371">epiphany</a> came in 1994, as he recounted in a company video. Business was booming, and Anderson was thinking about retiring.</p>
  <p>At the time, several employees who had joined Interface during a recent acquisition were asking what the company was doing to help the environment. “It was a question for which we had no answers,” said Anderson, who recalled the experience in a company video before his death in 2011. “It was awkward for our salespeople, manufacturing people, research people.” So Interface senior leaders convened a task force to develop the company’s position. They asked Anderson to kick it off by sharing his vision.</p>
  <p>“I didn’t have an environmental vision, and I didn’t want to make that speech. I was really sweating,” says Anderson. Then Paul Hawken’s book, <em>The Ecology of Commerce</em>, landed on his desk. It immediately influenced Anderson and the speech he gave. He ended up challenging the task force to make Interface and its products sustainable, starting by inventing carpeting made from fully recycled materials. Anderson soon found himself a full-time advocate.</p>
  <p>“I continued to articulate the vision over and over and over, even when people thought I had gone around the bend. I was talking and didn’t know if I was connecting. People were looking at me with blank faces. I didn’t know if they had heard me or cared,” he said.</p>
  <p>Soon enough, the tiny task force gained traction. And one by one, Interface employees backed sustainability as their unifying corporate strategy. Sustainability gave them a higher purpose to motivate and challenge everyone, while driving profit.</p>
  <p>Interface initially identified key areas in which it needed to make progress. Then the task force set aggressive targets, including zero waste to landfills, zero fossil fuel energy use, zero process water use, and zero greenhouse gas emissions. Interface continues to be a leading light of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/interface-recognized-as-global-sustainability-leader-for-20th-consecutive-year-by-globescan-and-sustainability-300468600.html">sustainable business strategy</a>, following a set of “EcoMetrics” that tracks materials and energy flowing in and out of the company. Most of its tile and carpet line is now made from waste products. In 2019, its net sales rose by 14% to US$1.3 billion.</p>
  <p>Anderson could not have foreseen that his work at Interface would leave a legacy of sustainability as corporate strategy for others to follow.</p>

  <h2 id="sustainability-redefined">Sustainability redefined</h2>
  <p>Other executives have light bulb experiences similar to Anderson’s that launch them on a journey to sustainability, says C. B. Bhattacharya, H. J. Zoffer chair of sustainability and ethics at the Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh and author of the book <em>Small Actions, Big Difference</em>.</p>
  <p>“Epiphany is an important part of the process,” he says. The executives might have pressure from shareholders to do more. Some have even faced boycotts of products that have fallen out of favor as tastes and customs change.</p>
  <p>What follows after that moment is the process of defining a new corporate purpose, one that is broader than merely being an engine for profits – and then, a massive change management effort that enables a large organization to pivot.</p>
  <p>The concept of sustainability has expanded as societies grapple with issues such as fair labor practices and ethical behavior.</p>
  <p>Today, most public company executives know they need a plan – and a good set of talking points – directing toward more sustainable business practices. Pro-environment measures like cutting down on paper use and reducing carbon emissions are not enough.</p>
  <p>That’s not just because addressing climate change will require more than these pro forma environmental moves. The concept of sustainability has expanded as societies around the world grapple with a range of issues.</p>
  <p>For example, in response to the social justice movement of 2020, business leaders are now getting involved in efforts to rebalance racial inequities. Fair labor practices also have become part of the conversation as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/ceos-see-pay-grow-1000percent-and-now-make-278-times-the-average-worker.html">pay gaps</a> between management and workers have stretched. Increasingly, investors, consumers, and employees are becoming keenly interested in companies’ actions on these issues. <a href="/resources/generation-z-behavior-explained">Younger consumers</a> are gaining influence as customers and workers, and their preference to work for companies that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90306556/most-millennials-would-take-a-pay-cut-to-work-at-a-sustainable-company">prize sustainability</a> is clear. Millennials and their younger peers also demand more environmentally and socially responsible practices as investors, according to Ioannis Ioannou, associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at London Business School. They’re saying, “I care, and I care profoundly about how my pension fund, for instance, is investing in my savings. What sort of world will I retire in if that pension fund, for instance, is investing in fossil fuels right now?”</p>

  <p>Leaders have noticed. In 2019, Business Roundtable released a <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">statement</a> signed by 181 CEOs of large U.S. public companies declaring that the purpose of a corporation should be to promote an economy that serves everyone. It’s not enough to make money for shareholders. All stakeholders – customers, suppliers, the communities in which they operate – should benefit. In one press release, these leaders broadened the traditional Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. Sustainability means being accountable to people and the planet as well as corporate shareholders.</p>
  <p>While some were skeptical of the pronouncement, Yale professor and author Dan Esty believes companies have little choice but to follow through. Consumers simply will not tolerate organizations that fail to redress the downstream negative effects on society that they produce (such as pollution, carbon emissions, and unequal pay).</p>
  <p>“It’s going to be increasingly unacceptable for companies to privately gain by imposing costs on the public,” says Esty, author and editor of 14 books relating to sustainability and governance, including the best-selling <em>Green to Gold</em> in 2006 and <em>Values at Work: Sustainable Investing and ESG Reporting</em> in 2020. Over time, he says, “the market will punish companies that fail to recognize this.”</p>
  <p>Leaders are coming around to this idea, albeit slowly. In a recent <a href="https://www.engieimpact.com/insights/global-executive-survey-preview">survey</a> of 200 top executives of large multinational corporations, which was conducted by ENGIE Impact, 75% said that sustainability strategy done well drives competitive advantage. Only 30% of those surveyed called their sustainability efforts successful, however. The results suggest that the executives do see sustainability having an increasingly significant effect on corporate revenues and profits in the next five years. ENGIE Impact, it is worth noting, is a sustainability consulting firm spun off from ENGIE, a French multinational electric utility.</p>

  <p>“We’re seeing more and more companies realize that putting sustainability at the core of their business strategy is actually a strategic advantage and is profitable,” says ENGIE Impact CEO Mathias Lelievre. While less than one-third of executives surveyed felt their sustainability efforts had been successful to date, the majority expected that to rise in five years.</p>
  <p>For example, Lelievre sees large companies like Unilever and Microsoft greatly stepping up their move toward carbon neutrality both within their own organizations and throughout their far-reaching supply chains. But the real story does not concern only traditional eco-friendly measures. The standard-bearers of the new, holistic view of sustainability are companies that have taken a traditional product or line of business and reimagined it to be better for people and the environment. These companies are transforming their entire business strategies to make the world a better place.</p>
  <p>In a recent survey of 200 top executives, 75% said sustainability strategy done well drives competitive advantage.</p>
  <p>Not surprisingly, as Interface’s Anderson discovered, shifting an organization’s strategy to sustainability requires a major effort, says Bhattacharya. It’s driven by relentless communication and change management efforts from the top, with leaders helping the company’s people to incubate, launch, and entrench sustainable practices. A shift toward sustainability also requires a new set of metrics beyond traditional measures that are found on company financial reports.</p>
  <p>At its heart, effective change happens when leaders mobilize the organization and manage resistance to the shift before the opportunity dries up. It’s about communicating what is being done and why, so employees can make sustainable strategy their own. “Successful strategic shifts require intensive organizational change management, the more so the further the pivot tries to move the company from its existing culture and capabilities,” says Paul Strebel, professor emeritus of governance and strategy, International Institute for Management Development (IMD).</p>

  <h2 id="managing-change-for-the-better">Managing change for the better</h2>
  <p>It’s hard to imagine a bigger shift in strategy than the one cigarette maker Philip Morris International (PMI) undertook in 2016. The company identified what it saw as a tremendous opportunity to begin shifting completely away from its core product, cigarettes, to alternatives scientifically substantiated as better choices for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke. PMI believed doing so could meet consumer demand for better choices and positively impact public health. PMI CEO André Calantzopoulos reaffirmed this commitment at the company’s 2017 annual shareholder meeting, saying the company was committed to a smoke-free future and shifting its resources toward the development and responsible marketing of scientifically backed alternatives.</p>
  <p>The change in strategy was driven by the realization – a long time coming – that PMI had to address the negative effects of its product, according to Huub Savelkouls, a 26-year PMI veteran who was its chief sustainability officer until his recent retirement. (Jennifer Motles is the new CSO.) Since its change in strategy, PMI hired an army of scientists, now numbering 900, who have spent the last 10 years and $7 billion researching smokeless tobacco.</p>
  <p>Its first main smoke-free product, IQOS, is now sold in 61 markets, recently including the U.S. IQOS is an electrically heated tobacco system that heats tobacco rather than burning it. Because the tobacco is not set on fire, there is no smoke or ash, and the levels of harmful chemicals are significantly reduced compared to cigarette smoke. This benefits the individual user, bystanders, and the environment. In July 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the marketing of IQOS as a modified risk tobacco product, the first (and so far, only) product to receive such approval. However, the company states that IQOS is not risk-free and delivers nicotine, which is addictive, and that the best choice is to quit or never start smoking.</p>
  <p>According to Savelkouls, PMI explicitly refrains from marketing to youth, as well as former smokers and those who have never smoked, and only markets its smoke-free products to current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke. The message is to fully switch and replace cigarettes with better choices.</p>
  <p>Savelkouls says the effort has been working: “Our current switch rate is 70%. Consumers don’t use both products.”</p>
  <p>For sustainability to take hold as a strategy, leaders are in constant communication with shareholders, the media, customers, and other stakeholders about the ongoing efforts and what they mean to each group.</p>
  <p>PMI’s journey has been marked by the need for constant communication, both inside and outside the organization.</p>
  <p>To start with, PMI employees were naturally concerned when they heard their company intended to sunset their mainstay product. Would they have jobs in the near future? What would remain after the company’s main product was gone? Senior leaders spent – and still spend – much effort communicating with employees about the company’s new direction and why it was necessary.</p>

  </p>
  <p>As Anderson discovered at Interface, in order for sustainability to take hold as strategy, communication – to shareholders, the media, customers, and a wider group of stakeholders – is endless. Suppliers are another important group to include in change management. PMI’s CEO and Savelkouls’s team were cognizant that the shift would affect others in its value chain, such as the tobacco farmers. (PMI has closed 10 cigarette factories in the last 10 years and plans to close more.) Also, the IQOS devices have an electronic component, so for the first time, Savelkouls and his team needed to start learning about practices for sustainable electronics manufacturing.</p>
  <p>Since announcing its commitment to move away from cigarettes, the growth of PMI’s revenues and profits have <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PM/philip-morris/revenue">dipped a bit</a> as the giant company refocuses on its smoke-free offerings. Still, the company says sales of its “reduced risk products” have grown to $4.9 billion, or about one-quarter of its total net revenues. And the market is following PMI’s lead. The global e-cigarette market was valued at $14 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vaping-market-to-reach-a-value-29-39-billion-at-a-cagr-of-20-3-from-2018-2022--a-report-from-tbrc-300904265.html">$29.39 billion</a> by 2022, according to The Business Research Company.</p>
  <p>Savelkouls believes the transition to new smoke-free products gives PMI 15 to 20 years of relative security from a revenue standpoint. In the meantime, the company is open to possibilities for entirely new product lines driven by its sustainability work. For instance, it has a small venture in Europe that offers life insurance to consumers who used to be smokers but who now have switched to smoke-free alternatives. In the past, these people would not have been able to buy life insurance; now they can – from PMI, which is backing up its belief that smoke-free products are a better choice than cigarettes. “We will for sure develop new competencies,” says Savelkouls.</p>

  <h2 id="pivots-with-a-purpose">Pivots with a purpose</h2>
  <p>PMI is not alone in shifting its traditional business strategy in a new, more sustainable direction.</p>
  <p>The trend cuts across industries.</p>
  <p>CVS, for example, has transcended its role as the corner drugstore where you stop in for a pack of cigs and a candy bar. It officially became <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cvs-caremark-announces-corporate-name-change-to-cvs-health-to-reflect-broader-health-care-commitment-273717081.html">a healthcare company</a> in 2014 with high-profile moves to stop the sale of cigarettes and offer minute-clinic health services and vaccinations at its stores, which now number 9,900. CVS Health revenues have increased every year since 2015, and <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/cvs-stock-verticle-integration-health-care-benefits-insurance-pharmacy-51571147790">its competitive position is strong</a>.</p>
  <p>Unilever, the consumer-packaged goods giant, is another interesting case. It plans to put sustainability squarely in the face of consumers by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-14/unilever-to-cut-emissions-to-zero-by-2039-adopt-carbon-labeling">labeling the carbon emissions</a> associated with 70,000 of its products as it cuts emissions to zero by 2039. Lelievre of ENGIE Impact says Unilever is also working to hold suppliers accountable on sustainability goals. That’s a critical step, since the supply chain typically represents 90% of a company’s carbon reduction opportunity.</p>
  <p>H&#x26;M, Sweden’s giant of fast fashion, was the first large fashion retailer to offer transparency about its manufacturing, starting with its Conscious collection. Consumers can click on a <a href="https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.0920357001.html#modalSustainability">mock-turtleneck sweater</a>, for example, and see that it’s made of acrylic, polyester, and wool (the retailer’s goal is to use all recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030) and that it was made in China by H&#x26;M supplier Shanghai Jingrong Science &#x26; Technology Co. Ltd.</p>
  <p>Even energy companies have made moves to less carbon-centric lines of business. Examples in Europe abound:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The former coal producer Dutch State Mines, now Royal DSM, has morphed over a decade into a science-based health and nutrition company. Its revenues showed growth up until the pandemic.</li>
    <li>Danish Oil and Natural Gas <a href="https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/climate-and-carbon/black-green-energy-15554049/">transformed itself</a> from one of Europe’s most coal-intensive companies into Orsted, a green-energy leader, <a href="https://orstedcdn.azureedge.net/-/media/q2_2020/interim-financial-report-h1-2020.ashx?la=en&#x26;rev=824777a016f8424fa0d34822df2993cb&#x26;hash=FEBEE5E445A7B1D7AEA06252D60712D9">without sacrificing profitability</a>.</li>
    <li>Enel, the Italian electric utility, is shifting a majority of its power generation to renewables, which offer a faster return on investment, more consistent earnings, and a better earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin than fossil fuel power generation plants, according to a <a href="https://www.sharedvalue.org/resource/hybrid-metrics/">recent report</a> from the Shared Value Initiative.</li>
    <li>Spanish utility Iberdrola comes in as the second fastest in decarbonization and rates highly on many ESG scoring systems, according to the report. It also comes out significantly better when one considers decarbonization and profit together.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These strategic shifts don’t occur overnight. Take DSM, which Strebel studied. Its transformation took nearly 10 years and hundreds of meetings to complete. “DSM used a rolling series of strategy dialogues with managers to gradually articulate the new biotech vision,” says Strebel.</p>

  <h2 id="measuring-sustainability-by-the-books">Measuring sustainability, by the books</h2>
  <p>Neil Stewart, director of corporate outreach at the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), is in the metrics business. His organization provides the means for enterprises around the world to report on financially material sustainability issues.</p>
  <p>It’s important for companies to identify the right factors that drive both sustainability and financial performance.</p>
  <p>“They can begin to build their strategy around those opportunities,” says Stewart. “This is an exciting time for companies and for investors where we start to see the markets drive solutions, innovation, and growth on pressing world problems. There has been this enormous public awakening, and it’s reflected in companies and in investors.”</p>
  <p>SASB standards identify the ESG issues that are financially material within 77 vertical industries, from apparel and automotive to technology and transportation. Companies aren’t necessarily managing the factors that matter to financial performance, Stewart says, “and as a result, they may not be seeing the impact of the increases in performance that they deserve for the effort they’re putting in.”</p>
  <div class="promo">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="read-the-news-story">Read the news story:</h3>
        <p>A maturing approach to embedding sustainability in business.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The industry standards that SASB provides lay out in detail how companies can change this. Take the example of an electronics manufacturer that Stewart recently spoke with. Like many companies, it had been working hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to better manage its water use. “These two issues are front of mind, but in the standard for electronics manufacturers, neither one is financially material,” says Stewart.</p>
  <p>That means that from the point of view of the company’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow, reducing greenhouse gases and better managing water use will not affect company performance. What is material for electronics manufacturers, adds Stewart, are things like energy management, hazardous waste disposal, and – beyond those factors – an energy-efficient product line.</p>
  <p>So if this company uses energy wisely and disposes of waste properly and then increases its focus on energy-efficient products, that will drive performance and increase customer loyalty. “For management, they might be thinking so much about what comes out of their smokestacks that they’re missing the factors that actually will drive better performance and enable it to attract the capital from investors who want to believe their investment will make an impact,” says Stewart.</p>

  <p>The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) provides standards that identify the Environmental, Social and Governance issues tied to financial performance in 77 industries. Each industry has its own set of disclosure topics and accounting metrics that will help companies in that space move the needle on profitability.</p>
  <p>SASB’s standard-setting process includes evidence-based research, participation from companies, investors, and subject-matter experts, and oversight and approval from an independent <a href="https://www.sasb.org/governance/standards-board/">standards board</a>. (For more detail, see the SASB Rules of Procedure, which in November 2020 were open for public comment.) SASB standards are increasingly cited by <a href="https://www.sasb.org/investor-use/investor-perspectives/">financial asset managers</a> in their proxy voting guidelines, including those from BlackRock, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Neuberger Berman, and State Street Global Advisors.</p>
  <p>The following are examples of three industries from the 77 classified by SASB with their disclosure topics. The accounting metrics within each disclosure topic can be found in the full SASB standards, which are available to download on the SASB Web site:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apparel, accessories, and footwear:</strong> Disclosure topics include management of chemicals in products, environmental impacts in the supply chain, labor conditions in the supply chain, and raw materials sourcing.</li>
    <li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> Disclosure topics include energy management, water management, food and packaging waste management, food safety, nutritional content, labor practices, supply chain management, and food sourcing.</li>
    <li><strong>Software and IT services:</strong> Disclosure topics include environmental footprint of hardware infrastructure, data privacy and freedom of expression, data security, recruiting and managing a global, diverse and skilled workforce, intellectual property protection and competitive behavior, and managing systemic risks from technology disruptions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Global climate change is threatening the fate of the world. Unrest and economic inequality are destabilizing both governments and populations. And then there’s the peril to the business entity itself. Senior executives face the choice of adapting their strategy toward sustainability or risking displacement by companies that do just that. “It might be the Teslas of the world, it might be the Beyond Meats of the world that enter established industries and replace the incumbents,” Ioannou says.</p>
  <p>Stewart calls the shift to a sustainable business strategy a “genuine awakening.”</p>
  <p>“It’s continuing despite COVID-19. So this concern about climate, about inequality, about diversity, there’s an enormous will to address ESG issues. These are fundamental business issues,” says Stewart.</p>
  <p>We are now at a watershed moment, says sustainability consultant Mike Barry. Many decades of globalization have lifted millions of people out of poverty and raised the standard of living for virtually everyone on the planet. But globalization also brought about economic losers as jobs migrated east, created a hyperconnected world where a pandemic can spread with ease, and plundered nature. Says Barry, “These problems are increasingly evident as wildfires burn, plastics choke sea life, and citizens take to the streets to protest.
