  <p>“This year is a very special Sapphire,” Klein said. “We are entering a new phase of AI, with endless possibilities for us all.”</p>
  <p>Klein and Chief Marketing and Solutions Officer Julia White used the keynote to outline how AI will deliver real business benefits for different corporate functions and “Bring Out Your Best,” this year’s event theme.</p>
  <h2 id="delivering-on-an-ai-promise">Delivering on an AI Promise</h2>
  <p>Klein emphasized how SAP has delivered on its promise to infuse generative AI throughout its business portfolio, has enabled customers to exploit the potential of business AI, and has positioned the Joule copilot as the new front end for SAP applications.</p>

  <p>Together, the two also announced the next evolution and new capabilities in both RISE with SAP and GROW with SAP. Since it was launched over three years ago, more than 6,000 customers have selected RISE with SAP. During his keynote, Klein announced that RISE with SAP will now include a dedicated enterprise architect to guide customers through the RISE with SAP Methodology as well as an integrated tool chain to help manage the process, system, and data landscape holistically across the RISE with SAP life cycle.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile White, broadcasting live from the central showcase on the SAP Sapphire show floor, announced that cloud ERP offering GROW with SAP will now include SAP Sales Cloud and Concur Expense at no additional charge. Whether its managing your finances or managing your expenses, GROW with SAP has you covered, she said.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-momentum">AI Momentum</h2>
  <p>Building on SAP’s business AI momentum, Klein and White also announced a series of expanded partnerships to help companies make the most out of this decisive AI moment. The expanded partnerships include deals with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Klein also announced the integration of Microsoft 365 Copilot with Joule, delivering what he described as a “truly differentiated employee experience.”</p>
  <p>Together onstage with customers and SAP Chief AI Officer Philipp Herzig, they showcased how SAP is infusing generative AI throughout the application portfolio and enabling customers to thrive in the AI era.</p>
  <p>“The business AI innovations we’re announcing will not only change how people work with SAP solutions, but how people work overall,” said Klein ahead of his keynote address.</p>
  <h2 id="new-joule-capabilities">New Joule Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Klein announced Joule for consulting capabilities and Joule for ABAP developer capabilities, which will help SAP’s 6-million-strong consultant and developer community to accelerate projects by 30% and implement SAP solutions faster than ever before.</p>
  <p>During his keynote he described business AI as being “an inflection point” and added, “Today’s AI announcements and partnerships build on our commitment to deliver revolutionary technology that drives real-world results, helping customers unleash the agility and ingenuity they need to succeed in today’s fast-moving business landscape.”</p>

  <p>“SAP is the only tech company who can infuse AI capabilities right into your business processes and workflows,” he said, saluting the achievements of the 40,000 SAP employees in the Product Development organization.</p>
  <h2 id="shout-out-to-sap-developers">Shout Out to SAP Developers</h2>
  <p>“No other tech company can offer a more powerful platform to transform enterprises to rewrite how business is run.” SAP developers have transformed SAP’s portfolio “from an ERP system that enabled transactions in real time, to a system with modular applications and embedded AI so that you can run intelligent, connected, and sustainable enterprises.”</p>
  <p>“We promised this to you, and we delivered,” Klein told audiences online and the 14,000 customers and partners attending SAP Sapphire in person this week in Orlando. “Now we are using the power of generative AI across our stack to once again revolutionize how businesses run and end users will work in the future.”</p>
  <p>After announcing generative AI copilot Joule in September 2023, Klein confirmed that it will become the new front-end and UX for SAP applications and “will turn your words into action.” Joule is ready for prime time, he declared, “and going forward, it will be embedded out of the box for all our cloud customers.”</p>
  <h2 id="joule-key-to-higher-productivity">Joule: Key to Higher Productivity</h2>
  <p>He predicted that Joule will also become the biggest productivity engine for every SAP end user, and that by the end of the year, 80% of the most used tasks will be managed via Joule and the 300 million end users of SAP products will be 20% more productive.</p>
  <p>While AI is a powerful technology facilitating huge opportunities for business and employees, the SAP CEO emphasized that it is also crucial to offer responsible AI. To that end, he announced that SAP is among the first tech companies to adhere to UNESCO’s AI principles.</p>
  <p>Klein wrapped up the keynote by emphasizing that SAP does not view AI as an end in itself, but rather as a tool to help the world run better and improve people’s lives. “You have my commitment that we will continue to listen to your needs, we will continue to deliver great innovations and we will continue to deliver great outcomes for your company.”</p>

  <p>By infusing Business AI across an enterprise cloud portfolio that powers the world’s most mission-critical processes and partnering with companies pushing the edge of what’s possible with AI, SAP is igniting a new wave of insight and ingenuity in global business.</p>
  <p>“The Business AI innovations we’re announcing at SAP Sapphire in 2024 will redefine the way businesses run,” says Christian Klein, CEO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “Today’s AI announcements and partnerships build on our commitment to deliver revolutionary technology that drives real-world results, helping customers unleash the agility and ingenuity they need to succeed in today’s fast-moving business landscape.”</p>
  <h2 id="ai-that-means-business">AI That Means Business</h2>
  <p>As SAP embeds Business AI across its enterprise solutions, it puts rich insights at users’ fingertips, empowering them to deliver better outcomes and elevate the creative problem-solving humans do best. Examples include AI-generated reports in SAP SuccessFactors solutions that give people managers responsibly sourced insights for compensation-related discussions as well as forecasting capabilities in SAP Sales Cloud solutions that predict combinations of salespeople and products most likely to drive sales. Meanwhile, the SAP Business Technology Platform is adding large language models from Amazon Web Services, Meta and Mistral AI to its generative AI hub. This capability in the SAP AI Core infrastructure makes it easier to build generative AI use cases for SAP applications.</p>
  <p>SAP’s generative AI copilot Joule, which quickly sorts and contextualizes data from multiple systems to advance automation and improve decision-making, is expanding throughout the company’s solution portfolio. Joule launched in <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">SAP SuccessFactors solutions last fall</a> and is now embedded into SAP S/4HANA Cloud solutions and others including SAP Build and SAP Integration Suite. Further expansion by year-end will include SAP Ariba and SAP Analytics Cloud solutions. At Sapphire, SAP also announced <a href="/">plans to further broaden Joule’s scope</a> by integrating it with Microsoft Copilot to surface even richer insights. This deep, bi-directional integration gives users a unified experience built right into the flow of work, enabling seamless access to information from interactions with business applications in SAP and Microsoft 365.</p>
  <p>Reflecting Business AI’s increasing importance, SAP is redoubling its commitment to the principles of relevant, reliable, and responsible AI it pioneered. At Sapphire, SAP is adopting the 10 guiding principles of the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which aim to ensure that AI technologies are developed and used in ways that respect human rights, promote fairness and contribute to sustainable development.</p>
  <h2 id="partnerships-that-scale-innovation">Partnerships That Scale Innovation</h2>
  <p>SAP is partnering with best-in-class technology leaders to push the limits of what generative AI can do at an enterprise level. In addition to our expanded collaborations with <a href="/2024/05/aws-sap-generative-ai-new-innovation">AWS</a> and Microsoft, partnerships with Google Cloud, Meta, Mistral AI and NVIDIA ensure SAP can harness the power of AI-ready technology to innovate at speed and deliver richer real-world results.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Google Cloud</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP and Google Cloud are expanding their partnership, using Business AI to help enterprises better predict and mitigate supply-chain risks to minimize disruptions and maintain optimal inventory levels. The companies will integrate Joule and the SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain solution with Google Cloud’s Gemini models AI assistant and Google Cloud Cortex Framework’s data foundation.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Meta</strong></div>

  </div>
  <p>SAP will leverage Meta Llama 3 to generate scripts that render highly customized analytics applications in SAP Analytics Cloud. Meta’s next-generation AI model excels at language nuances and contextual understanding, making it an ideal candidate for translating enterprise business requirements into tangible outcomes.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Mistral AI</strong></div>

  </div>
  <p>SAP and NVIDIA Corporation advance a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/sap-sapphire-ai-omniverse/">cross-product partnership</a> to embed cutting-edge technologies into enterprise-ready business applications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>As SAP trains Joule to serve as an AI assistant for the RISE with SAP solution implementations, NVIDIA’s state-of-the-art AI models sift through SAP consulting assets to provide relevant and precise answers to implementation-related questions;</li>
    <li>As SAP embeds Joule in the ABAP Cloud model to generate ABAP code for SAP developers, NVIDIA’s accelerated infrastructure will run, scale, and manage SAP’s generative AI model for ABAP code generation;</li>
    <li>As SAP infuses generative AI into the SAP Intelligent Product Recommendation solution, NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs enable the simulation of complex manufacturing products and configurations as industrial digital twins.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="cloud-technology-that-drives-agility-and-sustainability">Cloud Technology That Drives Agility and Sustainability</h2>
  <p>Business success in the era of AI means being in the cloud. SAP is making the move easier than ever with initiatives that help customers find partners with the expertise needed for complex SAP S/4HANA Cloud transformations. Further cloud innovations at SAP Sapphire include features that help the world’s organizations measure, manage and execute their sustainability strategies. SAP Sustainability Control Tower and SAP Sustainability Footprint Management solutions now track carbon footprints at scale and help businesses meet regulatory standards.</p>

        <p>Together, AWS and SAP are striving to make it easier for customers to adopt the RISE with SAP solution on AWS, to improve the performance and efficiency of SAP workloads running in the cloud and to embed generative AI into an enterprise’s entire portfolio of business-critical applications.</p>
        <p>“AWS was the first cloud provider certified to support the SAP portfolio and today, thousands of enterprise companies run SAP solutions on AWS to get the most out of their mission-critical applications,” said Matt Garman incoming CEO at AWS. “Now, AWS and SAP are making it faster and easier for companies to apply generative AI to their core business data to become more efficient, responsive and sustainable.”</p>
        <p>“Partnerships like this collaboration with AWS are critical as we embed generative AI solutions across our ERP applications so that customers can drive innovation at an accelerated pace,” said Christian Klein, Chief Executive Officer of SAP SE. “In addition to delivering modern cloud ERP to our joint customers, we are excited to support Amazon on their own transformation journey as they adopt RISE with SAP for pioneering areas such as Project Kuiper, Amazon’s satellite initiative intended to increase global broadband access.”</p>
        <h2 id="generative-ai-models-from-amazon-bedrock-available-on-the-generative-ai-hub-in-sap-ai-core">Generative AI Models from Amazon Bedrock Available on the Generative AI Hub in SAP AI Core</h2>
        <p>The generative AI hub in SAP AI Core infrastructure provides customers with secure access to a broad range of large language models (LLMs) that can easily be integrated into SAP business applications. With the integration of generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, SAP customers will be able to access high-performing LLMs and other foundation models (FMs) to build applications customized with their own data. Tens of thousands of customers use Amazon Bedrock to easily, quickly and securely build and scale generative AI applications using FMs from leading AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI and Amazon.</p>
        <p>With this integration, SAP customers may accelerate the adoption of generative AI and modernize key business processes built on SAP solutions. These innovations can be used in embedded use cases within RISE with SAP and the intelligent scenario lifecycle management functionality as an integration component or side-by-side directly on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). SAP and AWS plan to expand the use of Bedrock capabilities in the generative AI hub to further enable embedded AI functionality within SAP’s portfolio of cloud solutions and applications. This includes additional use cases across finance and product lifecycle management.</p>
        <h2 id="sap-to-use-aws-chips-to-train-and-deploy-future-sap-business-ai-offerings">SAP to Use AWS Chips to Train and Deploy Future SAP Business AI Offerings</h2>
        <p>SAP’s use of <a href="/2023/11/sap-hana-cloud-now-supports-aws-graviton">AWS Graviton3 chips to support SAP HANA Cloud</a> helps to deliver performance gains, cost savings and energy efficiency to SAP. By using Graviton3-based Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, SAP has realized up to 30% better compute for analytical workloads and an estimated 45% reduction in carbon footprint for SAP HANA Cloud. Now SAP and AWS are collaborating on the next generation of Graviton4 for SAP HANA Cloud and additional SAP applications to continue to improve performance and efficiency. Based on the success of running SAP HANA Cloud on AWS Graviton, SAP plans to use AWS Graviton to support SAP solutions and applications such as SAP BTP, SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud and the SAP Cloud ALM solution.</p>
        <p>SAP plans to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/">AWS Trainium</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/">AWS Inferentia</a> chips, purpose built for AI and machine learning (ML) workloads, for training and deploying future SAP Business AI offerings. Using Trainium and Inferentia2-based instances in a proof of concept, SAP engineers trained and fine-tuned generative AI LLMs in two days versus 23 days with comparable Amazon EC2 instances. By leveraging Trainium’s specialized architecture designed for efficient ML model training, SAP can accelerate the development process while maintaining high levels of accuracy and reliability.</p>
        <h2 id="increased-performance-for-rise-with-sap-on-aws">Increased Performance for RISE with SAP on AWS</h2>
        <p>Thousands of customers have selected RISE with SAP on AWS to run their largest, most complex, global SAP solution implementations. Now generally available, the next-generation Amazon EC2 High Memory U7i instances offer up to 32TiB of memory in a single instance and provide customers the memory and flexibility they need to support expanding SAP HANA database requirements. Amazon EC2 High Memory U7i instances are the first DDR5 memory-based 8-socket offering by a leading cloud provider to improve the performance of memory-intensive applications such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud as part of RISE with SAP.</p>
        <h2 id="amazons-project-kuiper-selects-rise-with-sap">Amazon’s Project Kuiper Selects RISE with SAP</h2>
        <p>Amazon companies, including Twitch, Zappos.com and Zoox Inc., already use SAP software on AWS to support their operations. And now Project Kuiper—Amazon’s satellite broadband network—is deploying RISE with SAP to support its complex supply chain and manufacturing operations and get the best performance and most value out of its mission-critical SAP software. Running SAP solutions on AWS allows Kuiper to take advantage of the latest SAP capabilities embedded in RISE with SAP to help drive impactful transformation, accelerating company decisions and enhancing overall performance and productivity.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of millions of people lack adequate internet access and Project Kuiper’s goal is to help close the digital divide by delivering fast, affordable broadband to a wide variety of customers operating in places without reliable internet connections. Delivering on that vision requires Kuiper to build satellites at an unprecedented rate. RISE with SAP allows the Project Kuiper team to leverage the most reliable and scalable infrastructure to run a modern, cloud ERP as a managed service, so they can focus on innovation instead of IT management.</p>

  <p>“IBM and SAP’s shared approach to generative AI, built on an open ecosystem, trust and purpose-built models, will help empower clients to optimize business outcomes,” said John Granger, Senior Vice President, IBM Consulting. “Our new Value Generation partnership initiative will enable clients to accelerate the path to innovation, competitive advantage and become a next generation enterprise through generative AI.”</p>
  <p>“It makes perfect sense to expand our partnership with IBM to help more customers accelerate their cloud journey leveraging RISE with SAP and realize the transformative benefits of generative AI for business in the cloud,” said Scott Russell, Chief Revenue Officer &#x26; Executive Board Member, Customer Success of SAP SE. “This expanded partnership will help more of our joint customers reach new heights by innovating through the cloud, data and business AI to grow and transform their businesses.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting">IBM Consulting</a> and SAP aim to accelerate transformation enabled by RISE with SAP by supporting clients in the following key areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Next-Generation AI Business Processes</strong>: Together, the companies are exploring opportunities to build new generative AI capabilities for RISE with SAP and infuse AI into SAP business processes across industry-specific cloud solutions and line of business applications. Initially, IBM plans to extend AI capabilities across SAP’s portfolio of cloud solutions and applications, all of which are underpinned by SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). This includes RISE with SAP, the GROW with SAP solution, financial solutions for the office of the CFO, supply chain management solutions, solutions for human capital management, SAP Customer Experience solutions and intelligent spend management solutions. IBM also plans to leverage SAP Signavio and SAP Business AI solutions to help define next-generation business processes through a proof-of-concept adoption program.</li>
    <li><strong>Next-Generation Industry Innovation</strong>: IBM and SAP plan to build intelligent industry use cases, enabled by data-driven insights, into end-to-end business processes to fuel next-generation industry innovation. These use cases will initially focus on the industrial manufacturing, consumer packaged goods (CPG), retail, defense, automotive and utilities industries. This includes IBM’s recent work with SAP to develop new AI solutions for the CPG and retail industries. As part of this initiative, IBM has begun the development of an extensive portfolio of over 100 AI solutions across industry, line-of-business and product delivery. In addition, IBM plans to develop prescriptive industry value maps that define next-generation business processes and opportunities for impact with AI. Clients will be able to access all of these new AI solutions through the global <a href="https://www.ibm.com/about/innovation-studio">IBM Innovation Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation.html">SAP Experience Center</a> sites.</li>
    <li><strong>Next-Generation Platform Architecture and Customer Adoption Approach</strong>: Next-generation enterprises require next-generation platform architectures and a modernized approach to customer adoption. Through the Value Generation partnership initiative, IBM intends to provide next-generation reference architectures that enable a clean core approach. To do this, IBM plans to leverage SAP BTP, SAP Signavio and LeanIX solutions. These new reference architectures will help define standards across data, process, systems and device integration, process orchestration and automation. IBM consultants supporting clients on SAP projects can also leverage IBM Consulting Advantage, IBM’s AI services platform, and its portfolio of proprietary methods, assets and Assistants to bring more repeatability and consistency to client delivery. With IBM Consulting Advantage, IBM consultants can transform the way they deliver SAP solutions to boost productivity and mitigate risk by leveraging generative AI to help complete tasks like generation of user stories, test scripts, training and change management content and code creation.</li>
    <li><strong>Next-Generation Ecosystem Expansion</strong>: IBM and SAP plan to partner around their respective employee network groups and “next-gen” communities, such as the business women’s networks at IBM and SAP, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/next-gen-innovation-platform/university-alliances.html">SAP University Alliances</a> program and the <a href="https://jobs.sap.com/content/Military-Veterans/?locale=en_US">Veterans to Work</a> program of SAP and Veterans at IBM to increase the SAP solutions experience in the consulting workforce and develop the next generation of talent. The companies also plan to explore new ways to collaborate on social impact programs, such as training at- risk youth in the IT sector and accelerating the integration of social businesses into global supply chains.</li>
    <li><strong>watsonx Planned Availability on the Generative AI Hub</strong>: IBM Granite Model Series are expected to be accessible for use across SAP’s portfolio of cloud solutions and applications – which is underpinned by the generative AI hub in SAP AI Core. The generative AI hub facilitates relevant, reliable and responsible business AI and provides instant access to a broad range of large language models (LLMs). This expands on IBM and SAP’s collaboration around <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-05-02-SAP-to-Embed-IBM-Watson-Artificial-Intelligence-into-SAP-R-Solutions">embedding IBM Watson AI technology into SAP solutions</a>. To further highlight watsonx.ai Granite capabilities, IBM Consulting plans to build extensions using the model on the generative AI hub for select customers.</li>
  </ul>

      <div>From cloud to generative AI, the list of new and emerging technologies continues to grow in our era of digital intelligence. Yet it’s also the era of inflation, geopolitical tension, supply chain disruption, and countless other challenges. How are businesses supposed to make sense of all these technologies – let alone transform their businesses with them – while simply trying to survive during such a challenging time?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That’s where Claudio Muruzabal, chief business officer of SAP SE, steps in.</p>
  <p>Muruzabal is responsible for supporting the Customer Advisory, Solution Area and Services Sales, and Customer Success Management &#x26; Engagement teams at SAP. For more than eight years, he has played an important role in understanding not only an increasingly complex technology landscape but also how businesses actually use the technology at their disposal. He supports teams that help bring SAP customers closer to their goals by leveraging SAP solutions. This begins with advising customers through honest conversations about how they can apply the intelligent capabilities now included in many SAP solutions, such as generative AI.</p>
  <p>I sat down with Muruzabal to find out more about his role, how SAP customers are winning with intelligent technology, and the growing impact of customer success management at SAP.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: AI is all the rage today, so let’s start there. What are the biggest opportunities for businesses to use AI?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Muruzabal</strong>: Opportunity is everywhere for <a href="/topics/ai">AI</a>. And it’s bigger than just automating processes to increase efficiency, which is what was talked about for the longest time. At SAP, we’re seeing how AI can support relevant business processes to instill innovation and competitiveness. While many players in the industry are focused on developing AI engines and large language models, we are focused on accelerating business value through generative AI. I could talk all day about how AI is transforming data analytics and decision-support systems as well as supply chain optimization, predictive maintenance, and HR. Every day we are discovering new opportunities for customers to leapfrog their competition when they combine the power of generative AI with the context of their business data and processes.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>What are some examples of how SAP customers are using AI, and what value have they realized so far?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="promo blue">

      <div>
        <h3 id="sap-business-ai-revolutionary-technology-real-world-results">SAP Business AI: Revolutionary technology, real-world results</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There’s really so much to get excited about when it comes to how our customers are using the AI capabilities included with their SAP solutions. Across industries, workers everywhere are using natural language to instantly get the data insights they need using the SAP Analytics Cloud solution. I like how busy recruiters can tap into generative AI with SAP SuccessFactors solutions to create compelling job descriptions and interview questions in less time. Joule, our AI assistant and copilot, can support end users in getting the right answers on how to get the most of our cloud solutions. With Joule already embedded across the portfolio – generally available in SAP SuccessFactors HCM, SAP Start, and SAP S/4HANA Cloud – we are all excited about the opportunities for our customers.</p>
  <p>All industries can get this unique value, including professional soccer clubs FC Bayern Munich and Hertha BSC that are using a scouting prototype powered by AI to find and develop the next generation of star athletes.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>AI can solve a lot of problems, but what about the underlying foundational technology stack companies have today? What conversations are you having with businesses about their technology investments?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Early on in our conversations with customers, it’s important to understand how businesses can set up their core, foundational enterprise technology platform running in the cloud. This is critical to establish a journey of innovation including <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html">SAP Business AI</a>. Coming back to the foundation, many of our customers have built numerous modifications on top of their core ERP. In order to build a true cloud operating model – essential to embrace innovation including AI – it is critical to move to a clean core model. This means that any modification to the ERP functionality offered by SAP is built outside of the core, using extensibility solutions. This is not a technical topic only. Although clean core contributes to the cost-efficient operation of the platform, the true contribution is bringing flexibility and adaptability to the business, converting the cloud operating model into a unique “innovation as a service” platform.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>What makes SAP unique and stand out to customers with its value proposition?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP has the unique value of being the global leader in best of suite solutions built with more than 50 years of industry knowledge and ERP technology leadership. On top of this, our leading “best of breed” solutions, such as in HCM, customer experience, intelligent spend and business network, and more, can provide the best functionality and the right integration into the core. Only SAP can offer this value proposition. When we combined this with the cloud operating model – widely adopted by our RISE with SAP customers – we provide exponential value for the innovation as a service proposition.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>How can customers get the most from their investments? What kind of support is there to help them transform and innovate?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Customer success management is essential in the cloud. It is the end-to-end engagement with our customers, from advisory to sales execution to onboarding, adoption, and consumption. We provide the tools, assets, and content to help accelerate adoption and consumption so as to maximize the value from first use of the solution to full and future use. SAP Preferred Success services can accelerate the time to value even more. To support this motion, deep <a href="/2024/02/driving-customers-business-outcomes-telemetry">telemetry</a> being built into our cloud solutions allows customers and our customer success management leaders to better understand how the solutions are being used while identifying opportunities to expand usage.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Where do advisory services fit into the customer journey?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Customer advisory services might be the most essential part of the journey with a customer. Successful projects start with the right business case definition, anchored in the best understanding of the industry and business of our customers. With that in mind, our Customer Advisory teams support building the right technical solutions that can support an enterprise architecture. This is the first step in moving in the right direction of building the cloud operating model.</p>

  <p>By Dante Ricci and Lauren Gibbons Paul</p>
  <p>Charities everywhere are feeling pinched. It’s a condition that is part economics and part donor fatigue. The U.S. economy, for example, is growing <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/01/numbers-us-economy-grows-faster-expected-year-and-final-quarter-2023#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Commerce%20Department%27s,Americans%20making%20and%20spending%20more">faster than expected</a> but Europe and Japan remain flat. After a drop in U.S. charitable giving in 2022 – only the fourth time in 40 years, according to a Giving USA <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/news-thought-leadership/2023-holiday-giving-insights/#:~:text=Charitable%20Giving%20in%202023%20is%20Down%20Year%2Dto%2DDate&#x26;text=We%27re%20hearing%20similar%20reports,%2Dto%2D%20date%20in%202023">report</a> – donations in 2023 plunged further, by <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/news-thought-leadership/2023-holiday-giving-insights/#:~:text=Charitable%20Giving%20in%202023%20is%20Down%20Year%2Dto%2DDate&#x26;text=We%27re%20hearing%20similar%20reports,%2Dto%2D%20date%20in%202023">as much as 30%</a>.</p>
  <p>All of this makes new donor acquisition and donor retention, key imperatives, according to <a href="https://afpglobal.org/news/donor-retention-and-acquisition-key-challenges-social-sector-q3-2023">the Fundraising Effectiveness Projec</a>t. According to NonProfitPRO, a resource for nonprofits, even recurrent donors <a href="https://www.nonprofitpro.com/post/reality-donor-fatigue-strategies-overcome-it/#:~:text=Donor%20fatigue%20is%20a%20real,how%20fundraisers%20can%20overcome%20it">feel fatigued</a> and are keeping their wallets shut as they are hit with increased communications through different channels from individual charities and appeals from additional organizations. Given these trends, nonprofits can reasonably expect lower donation numbers, at least for the near future.</p>
  <p>Ashutosh Nandeshwar, a consultant who advises nonprofits, sees limitless potential for artificial intelligence as a means to mitigate and reverse these trends. Nandeshwar, SVP of data science and analytics at CCS Fundraising, says nonprofits can use both traditional AI (including machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics) and modern AI (including natural language generation and generative AI) to make more strategic use of limited resources.</p>
  <p>Money – fundraising – is a core function of a nonprofit, like revenue generation in the private sector. However, these organizations face additional challenges beyond retaining generous donors and attracting new ones. Aligned with this need is the drive to strengthen the efficiency of their business processes and improve their mission performance. Leaders working to address these challenges are finding encouraging signs that AI tools, from machine learning algorithms to ChatGPT, can help.</p>
  <p>“Especially with generative AI, not only can it be a lever for becoming more efficient, but [nonprofits] can also free up time to do the things they do best, which is being donor-centric, stewarding and cultivating those donors,” says Nandeshwar. “AI can help elevate philanthropic outcomes and, ultimately, better mission fulfillment.”</p>

  <p>Artificial intelligence tools in a variety of forms can increase efficiency (save money) by quickly identifying potential new donor pools, analyzing past giving behavior, and zeroing in on the specific individuals and foundations who are most likely to donate. Nonprofits are also using AI for robotic process automation to eliminate costly and time-consuming manual processing of tasks, such as extracting data and filling in forms. Another important advantage: The ability to create personalized donor experiences that cut through cluttered inboxes and limited attention spans goes a long way toward perking up donors.</p>
  <p>Charities may recognize AI’s potential, but we’re still in the early days of adoption, according to a survey by NonProfitHR, a talent advisory service. Its 2024 <a href="https://www.nonprofithr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-Social-Impact-AI-Survey_Nonprofit-HR.pdf">survey of</a> 250 social sector organizations found respondents viewed generative AI as a useful tool for everything from taking meeting notes to writing job descriptions and drafting social media posts. Still, 45% of respondents said they did not yet use generative AI, with 14% planning to begin using it within the next 12 months.</p>

  <p>For those getting started on AI projects, the opportunities are there and likely will grow with experience. To get the benefit of using AI tools, there are legal considerations to plan for, including privacy, regulatory issues, and insurance (see sidebar) But there is no question: AI can help nonprofits better manage their money, mission, and people.</p>
  <p>Nonprofits have begun pursuing a range of projects in the past year-plus since ChatGPT and other widely available generative AI tools emerged in late 2022. Among the opportunities they have identified: AI helps nonprofits better understand their donors’ giving patterns.</p>
  <p>Nonprofits are increasingly using <a href="/resources/eight-examples-of-artificial-intelligence-in-action">generative AI</a> to analyze donor data and predict giving patterns, resulting in more targeted and effective fundraising campaigns. For example, the American Cancer Society applied machine learning in a 2022 project to pinpoint which of its digital advertising campaigns generate the most revenue, as well as raise general awareness.</p>
  <p>The program has generated impressive results, according to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/adtheorent-uses-machine-learning-powered-predictive-advertising-to-boost-donations-and-drive-awareness-for-american-cancer-society-301525751.html">a press release</a> from an advertising technology company working with the cancer charity. “Every bit of our campaign spend needs to be optimized for the best possible performance, so our key advertising goal was to reach the most probable donors, and then engage them in a way that would drive donations,” says Ben Devore, director of media strategy for the American Cancer Society. The program generated donation revenue that came in at 117% over its benchmark and a donor engagement rate of nearly 70% throughout the campaign. The click-through rate on interactive banners was 1.5%, 87.5% above the charity’s benchmark.</p>

  <h2 id="ai-powered-chatbots-can-streamline-communications-and-increase-donor-engagement">AI-powered chatbots can streamline communications and increase donor engagement.</h2>
  <p>Generative AI can seamlessly create new content (such as e-mails, press releases, appeal letters, blogs, and social media posts) and foster creativity. The key is to keep a human involved for oversight of the tone and to ensure accuracy. This basic risk-reduction strategy is a good rule of thumb for all AI use.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-chatbots-can-help-guide-potential-donors-through-the-donation-process">AI chatbots can help guide potential donors through the donation process.</h2>
  <p>And they can help in designing and delivering personalized donor experiences. The tools make this quick and cost-effective to do.</p>
  <h2 id="generative-ai-can-fill-in-as-your-grant-writing-co-pilot">Generative AI can fill in as your grant writing “co-pilot.”</h2>
  <p>Tools like ChatGPT are famously helpful as a starting point for communications of all types. But they are useful for higher octane work such as grant proposals, too. Services such as grantboost.io have emerged specifically geared to help nonprofits with grant writing.</p>
  <h2 id="let-generative-ai-help-you-cast-a-wider-foreign-language-net">Let generative AI help you cast a wider (foreign language) net.</h2>
  <p>The translation capabilities in ChatGPT and other tools make it easy and fast to engage with nonnative English speakers. Just be sure you understand the regulations when operating in a new jurisdiction (see below for more information).</p>
  <h2 id="machine-learning-tools-can-help-nonprofits-unearth-useful-nuggets-from-the-trove-of-data-they-possess">Machine learning tools can help nonprofits unearth useful nuggets from the trove of data they possess.</h2>
  <p>This includes how their organization is meeting its mission and making a difference. Donors increasingly want to know more about where their donations go; insights driven from machine learning (ML) can provide the proof points they seek. This style of increased transparency should help decrease donor fatigue.</p>
  <p>ML can point to receptive new audiences. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which funds close to 80% of its US$1 billion operating budget through individual donors, was driven to find new ways to interact with existing donors and identify new ones. According to a story on the Future of Marketing site, St. Jude integrated ML into its emotionally engaging donor appeal videos and offered easy ways to donate in the moment and engage new, younger, and more diverse audiences, according to <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of-marketing/digital-transformation/future-proofing-business/">an article</a> at Google’s Future of Marketing.</p>

  <h2 id="ml-can-boost-the-efficacy-of-a-charitys-mission">ML can boost the efficacy of a charity’s mission.</h2>
  <p>Perhaps the most exciting use of AI and ML is to help the nonprofit more effectively carry out its core mission.</p>
  <p>Case in point: the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), uses ML to pinpoint the best location for <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018-10-02-using-ai-improve-refugee-integration">refugee resettlement</a> while accounting for a refugee’s ability to speak the local language and find a job. A study found the tool could increase the refugee employment rate by as much as 40%.</p>
  <p>"AI can help elevate philanthropic outcomes and, ultimately, better mission fulfillment."</p>
  <p><em>– Ashutosh Nandeshwar, SVP of data science and analytics for CCS Fundraising</em></p>
  <p>In another example, Breastcancer.org – a leading digital resource for people affected by breast cancer – uses ML to personalize the patient education journey, <a href="https://www.nonprofitpro.com/article/how-nonprofits-are-using-machine-learning-to-support-those-in-need/">according to</a> a NonProfitPRO article. The same article cites Polaris, a 150-person nonprofit that operates the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, providing 24/7/365 support for survivors of human trafficking. With the number of calls from other agencies and survivors themselves increasing thousands of percentage points from 2008 to 2021, the nonprofit implemented a voice bot powered by ML to direct nonurgent general information requests (over 1,700 in the first six months) to informational resources, leaving staff free to engage with more urgent calls.</p>
  <h2 id="gain-insights-into-donor-sentiment">Gain insights into donor sentiment</h2>
  <p>Tools that incorporate natural language processing (NLP) and ML can sift through social media posts and reams of other structured and unstructured data to analyze how members of the public think and feel about relevant issues.</p>
  <p>For example, the White Ribbon Alliance, a Washington, DC-based global women’s health advocacy group, used NLP to analyze findings in “What Women Want,” a survey of one million women from eight countries that asked about their reproductive healthcare priorities.</p>
  <p>Responses from women in Mexico, Cameroon, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Malawi, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania came back as unstructured data: text formats, using open-ended questions in a variety of languages, which made the survey difficult to analyze on a global scale. NLP made manageable the task of sorting through and understanding the responses to questions such as “What is your one request for quality reproductive and maternal healthcare services?” (Manual tabulations would have been unworkable with this number of respondents.) The White Ribbon Alliance shared the key concerns with case workers on the ground in respondent countries, and they were surprised by the depth of the data, which they were then able to use to help local constituencies, according to a <a href="https://fastdatascience.com/natural-language-processing-for-non-profit/">blog post</a> on Fast Data Science.</p>

  <h2 id="legal-considerations-to-nonprofits-use-of-ai">Legal Considerations to Nonprofits’ Use of AI</h2>
  <p>Are you fired up to use generative AI or other tools to increase efficiency and donor engagement? Not so fast. First, there’s a host of legal issues you’ll need to consider. According to an article in the <em>NonProfit Times</em>:</p>
  <p>Data privacy regulations that predate the debut of the newest AI tools are a top concern with AI use for nonprofits as they need to ensure compliance related to fundraising activities (for example, GDPR and the California <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">Consumer Privacy Act</a>), consent, safeguarding data, and providing individuals with rights regarding their personal information and restrictions on solicitation practices.</p>
  <p>Intellectual property becomes an issue when AI systems create new works that need to be protected (such as software, content, and images). You will also need to take steps to ensure the AI system is not infringing on another intellectual property (IP) owner’s rights.</p>
  <p>Discrimination can inadvertently be introduced by AI, either by perpetuating pre-existing biases into the system or by introducing new biases from the AI system itself. Either way, you’ll need to <a href="/blogs/thinkers-unmasking-unconscious-bias-in-ai">guard against unfair bias</a>.</p>
  <p>Tort liability can arise if the AI system emits inaccurate, negligent, or biased results that harm donors or prospects (or anyone else who is harmed by the content). Use human gatekeepers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the AI system’s output.</p>
  <p>Insurance is needed to reduce the legal risks identified above. Traditional directors and officers insurance is likely to be insufficient to cover these risks.</p>

  <h2 id="rewards-but-not-without-risk">Rewards, but not without risk</h2>
  <p>Along with the opportunities offered by AI technologies come challenges, including legal considerations and regulatory risk, especially in regions with strong privacy laws like Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The requirements to maintain data anonymity are growing, even in the United States, and that will affect your ability to leverage donor data.</p>
  <p>Data quality is another challenge. Quality and availability of data are imperative. AI is only as good as the data it uses to learn and refine its outputs. Organizations often run into roadblocks with an inability to pull out data from old systems or difficulties embedding AI into legacy systems.</p>
  <p>Equally important are the algorithms used to process and analyze the data. Plan to put a lot of consideration into the choice of algorithm.</p>
  <p>You should also consider the possibility of unwittingly injecting bias into your use of AI and the unintended consequences that could result. It is important to fully understand the system’s limitations and to ensure AI algorithms are transparent and explainable. Ensure that the security capabilities provided by vendors provide appropriate encryption and access controls and that you can adhere to applicable data protection regulations.</p>
  <p>You also need to make sure your organization has the right skill sets for the type of AI. Even if you are purchasing and using pre-built products, you should have some internal people with AI skill sets to be able to govern its use.</p>
  <p>Managing these risks is prudent – but doing so should not close the door on the promise that AI tools have to help nonprofit organizations reverse recent trends.</p>
  <p>“We have observed philanthropic trends for generations,” says Greg Hagin, principal and managing director for CCS Fundraising. “Over the last twenty years, donors down, dollars up. More recently, donors down, dollars down, factoring inflation. Whether a crisis or concern, we do believe these AI-enabled technologies can help address the challenge by strengthening connection and commitment with personalized messaging and tailored offering.”</p>
  <h2 id="where-to-begin">Where to begin</h2>
  <p>For nonprofits interested in using AI to reap benefits relating to money, mission, and people, consider these starting points:</p>
  <p><strong>Start with small projects.</strong> Test the feasibility and benefits of the technology and then increase use as you become more comfortable. Jump-start the use of AI with pre-trained programs by investing in pre-built products to test out narrow use cases.</p>
  <p><strong>Collaborate cross-functionally.</strong> Include a cross-functional team in all the decisions and implementation to ensure the use of technology aligns with your mission and benefits the communities you serve. Don’t forget to engage with other nonprofit organizations to share knowledge, benchmark, and understand lessons learned.</p>
  <p><strong>Safeguard.</strong> Allow for learning and adjustments along the way, which will help minimize risks. Fully understand the systems’ limitations and ensure AI algorithms are transparent and explainable.</p>

  <p>Hearing me spotlight our direct and indirect procurement, external workforce, and travel and expense management solutions is one thing. Seeing them in action is something way more powerful. Here are a few recent customer success stories to take in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>American Eagle Outfitters</strong> (AEO), a leading global specialty retailer offering high-quality on-trend clothing, accessories, and personal care products through its portfolio of brands, needed to evaluate indirect purchasing processes and vendor relationships to maximize efficiency. See how <a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/10/2ed3b1af-917e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.htm?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124l">SAP Business Network for Procurement and SAP Ariba solutions</a> helped simplify processes and deliver compliant purchasing protocols across the company.</li>
    <li>Power provider to over 900,000 electric customers, <strong>Oklahoma Gas &#x26; Electric Company</strong> (OG&#x26;E) faced challenges with the complexity of third-party and cross-department management of contingent workers. After transitioning SAP Fieldglass solutions to internal management, OG&#x26;E <a href="/2024/02/oge-and-brightspeed-manage-employees-contingent-workers">gained the visibility</a> to make more informed financial decisions, like supplier negotiations.</li>

Now, using SAP Business Network, suppliers complete predefined quality tests and document them before confirming or sending an order. This enables Vestas employees to be warned in advance of any quality issues further up the supply chain, so they can <a href="/2024/02/vestas-powering-quality-in-supply-chain">take corrective action</a>.</li>
    <li>Most <strong>KUKA</strong> employees are based in Germany, where tax regulation is complex and submitting hotel and entertainment expenses is anything but simple. The KUKA team worked together to develop a simple process using SAP Concur solutions, connected to SAP ERP, that allows employees to create hotel and entertainment expenses <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/casestudy/kuka?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">seven times faster</a> with fewer errors and fewer rejected expense reports.</li>

      <div>Success can take many forms. It’s achieving AI-driven results faster and smarter. It’s unlocking more meaningful and aspirational career development experiences. It’s empowering employees and managers through simple HR-related tasks in the flow of work, freeing up more productive time across the organization.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And for you and your business, you can tell all those success stories – and more – with the SAP SuccessFactors HCM suite and our first half 2024 release.</p>
  <p>As your organization and employees begin to embrace AI, <a href="/topics/human-resources">HR</a> has the opportunity to drive new levels of employee productivity, engagement, and growth. SAP SuccessFactors HCM can give you everything you need – the global foundation, skills framework, people-first experiences, and purpose-built AI capabilities – to help take HR to the next level. With the SAP SuccessFactors first half 2024 release, we are delivering more than 250 innovative features and enhancements.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-business-ai">SAP Business AI</h2>
  <p>In 1H 2024, we are thrilled to introduce more than 25 new AI capabilities to enable better employee experiences and new levels of productivity.</p>
  <p>Among these capabilities include the ability for applicants to provide skills during the application process. This can enable recruiters to see a skills compatibility for each applicant based on matching the applicant’s skills and the job requisition, helping improve applicant screening and time to hire. Furthermore, personalization in SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace is enhanced with new AI-driven recommendation categories, “Ignite Your Role” and “Reach Your Aspirations.” These guided experiences can enable employees to proactively take steps to reach their development goals.</p>

  <p>We have also added more than 15 new <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html">Joule</a> capabilities in this release to help both managers and employees get work done in a conversational way, such as creating or changing a position, creating spot awards, clocking in and out, and viewing pay statements as well as time capabilities like requesting time off, checking leave balances, and syncing holidays to Outlook calendars while managers can review and approve time off. Further, employees can now clock in and out using Joule, Microsoft Teams, or the SAP SuccessFactors Mobile app.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-successfactors-employee-central">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</h2>
  <p>We are excited to unveil two new people profile experiences – the profile preview and the spotlight view. The profile preview can provide a snapshot of key areas of the employee profile, including job, manager, location, and contact details, to quickly view and connect with others. Additionally, the spotlight view can showcase employee skills and competencies, mentoring and target roles, and other relevant personal and organizational information.</p>
  <p>We are also introducing a new org chart experience with a refreshed look and feel. Available on desktop and mobile, users can explore their organizational structure with improved expand and collapse capabilities, which helps provide full accessibility to an employee’s profile preview, with an option to open the new spotlight view.</p>

  <p>Customers can now automatically process new hires from SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting and SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding into SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central. This capability helps further reduce the time to hire, which is especially important with mass, seasonal, and high-volume hiring.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-successfactors-employee-central-global-benefits">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Global Benefits</h2>
  <p>With this release, we are pleased to introduce a new benefits enrollment experience for insurance, savings, and pension benefit types. Available on both desktop and mobile, the guided experience for benefits elections can give employees increased convenience with improved navigation and increased confidence with side-by-side plan comparisons and embedded instructional text. Additionally, employees can update dependent information and manage beneficiaries directly from the benefits enrollment process, which helps further streamline the enrollment experience.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-successfactors-time-tracking">SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking</h2>
  <p>We are thrilled to share the launch of a new time sheet experience that integrates the latest version of My Timesheet in SAP S/4HANA with SAP SuccessFactors. Employees can now record time for payroll, as well as against activities and cost objects, from a single time sheet across applications. This helps organizations leverage real-time connectivity between HR and finance operations to keep track of employee activity and labor costs and to pay employees accurately and on time.</p>
  <p>Additionally, a new monthly calendar view for time sheets can give employees and managers a complete picture of recorded time over a month. Users can drill down into specific days and submit or approve time for pay periods beyond a week, such as biweekly or monthly.</p>
  <p>For managers, a new time approval center helps simplify approvals with a centralized dashboard highlighting anomalies for swift resolution. Managers can monitor team working hours effectively, helping to ensure accurate and timely payroll processing.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-successfactors-onboarding">SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding</h2>
  <p>With enhancements to the onboarding journey experience, new hires can now use the new Your Onboarding Checklist page to reference and complete all tasks – onboarding data collection, compliance tasks, additional onboarding tasks, and exploring the onboarding guide – from one place with a single view. Available for new hires, rehires, internal hires, and employees with global assignments, this improved experience can save time for onboarding participants while helping to ensure productivity from the start.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>With the gathering pace of headlines touting artificial intelligence in the business press, one could be forgiven for assuming that all facets of the enterprise stand to benefit equally from its application – everything from the electric stapler to the espresso machine to the ergonomic furniture.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But in reality, some functions are much better suited than others to gain from AI. The deeper the reservoir of data associated with an operational process – and the broader the sharing of that data not only within an organization but among its trading partners as well – the greater the potential for AI to bolster collaborative capabilities, instill operational resilience, and unlock exponential value.</p>
  <p>By facilitating the convergence of trading partners’ operational data, cloud-based networks strengthen transparency and foster collaboration across interconnected processes such as procurement, supply chain, logistics, and asset management. The vast troves of data accumulated from these functions – and the insights they reveal – bear significant implications for forecasting demand, planning inventory, sourcing components, procuring labor, maximizing utilization, managing logistics, gauging sustainability, achieving compliance, and securing financing. Yet the sheer volume of such data, sometimes spanning billions or more transactions, can defy human interpretation in the quest to optimize decision-making.</p>
  <p>That’s where artificial intelligence comes in.</p>
  <p>As the world’s largest B2B collaboration platform, <a href="https://www.sap.com/businessnetwork">SAP Business Network</a> facilitates hundreds of millions of transactions per year, capturing a unified, end-to-end view of spend. So prodigious is the cloud-based network’s volume – exceeding US$5.3 trillion in commerce annually, greater than the gross domestic product of every nation except the United States and China – that, through innovations in predictive and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/innovations.html#ai">generative AI</a> technologies, SAP Business Network is transforming procurement, supply chain, logistics, asset management, and related operational processes, with the goal that every business runs as an intelligent, sustainable enterprise.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The cloud is uniquely fit for the task of delivering simplicity within a many-to-many network of trading partners. A network’s features, from its search functionality to the matching of buyers with suggested suppliers, must aid the dual goals of transparency and ease of use. Predictive and generative AI capabilities augment businesses’ ability to discover trading partners on the basis of complementary resources, mutual value, and strategic alignment. With every successive use, generative AI sharpens its ability to anticipate operations professionals’ requirements to match supply with demand. Meanwhile, AI helps businesses to automate their most time-consuming procurement and supply chain activities through predictive mechanisms as well, hastening the ability to arrive at better, more informed decisions. When applied to the broadest possible sets of operational data, AI removes the guesswork from business-to-business commerce and replaces it with new leads, renewed confidence, and resilient supply chains.</p>
  <p>With these objectives in mind, <a href="/topics/business-network">SAP Business Network</a> is transforming its powerful discovery functionality into a simple chat prompt this year. Also in 2024, generative AI will enable SAP Business Network to create catalog content based on existing data in the network, detect potential errors within invoices, and obtain quote requests from buyers via natural-language, on-screen dialogue with matched suppliers. Integrating AI capabilities into SAP Business Network thus promises to reshape the trading partner experience by enabling buyers to reach far more suppliers with precision for the specific goods and services they produce. Trading partners large and small benefit equally from the increased flow of accurate, detailed, and complete information identifying each other’s offerings and competitive advantages.</p>
  <p>As AI technologies take shape and mature, infusing intelligence natively into business processes, digital commerce platforms are certain to introduce many enhanced capabilities. Naturally, with its scale and history of innovation, you can expect SAP Business Network to lead the way. But you’ll know the moment that artificial intelligence has truly transformed enterprise software when its features subtly blend in, almost imperceptibly, to simplify everyday operational processes, making business applications more intuitive and predictive for trading partners. That is our vision for AI at SAP Business Network, where the intelligence may be increasingly artificial but the commitment to customer success is invariably genuine.</p>

        <p>Agribusiness players are using generative AI to find more and better data to improve yields and manage natural resources.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By Eric Somitsch and Tam Harbert</p>
  <p>Imagine a farmer in India growing millet on two acres of land. Rain has been scarce this year, and a new type of pest ate much of his crop. He’s concerned that his tried-and-true practices are not as effective as they used to be, and he’s wondering what might increase his odds of a better harvest next season. He pulls out his phone and asks an AI chatbot, which provides him with recommendations.</p>
  <p>This scenario represents a new use of generative AI in agriculture and illustrates a new opportunity to bring innovations to the world’s farmlands.</p>
  <p>Generative AI promises benefits for society at large as well as for the agriculture industry, from smallholder farmers to larger cooperatives to the giant players in commodity crops, seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. The extent to which the industry has begun experimenting with targeted uses of generative AI offers multiple lessons learned for other business sectors.</p>

  <p>More than ever, farmers need to make <a href="/blogs/the-future-of-feeding-the-world">more efficient use of natural resources</a> such as soil, seed, and water and lessen the toll that farming takes on the environment through methane generation, pesticide use, and other factors. The food system generates about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions globally, according to <a href="https://www.un.org/en/actnow/food">the United Nations</a>. Consumers are demanding more sustainably grown products, as Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising">points out</a>. At the same time, agriculture is part of the climate; for example, when farmers grow perennial crops, their soils <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/soil-based-carbon-sequestration">store more carbon</a>. But agriculture is also vulnerable to extreme weather patterns that are causing more floods, droughts, and wildfires.</p>
  <p>In agriculture, AI is already being used to improve food production and sustainability. For example, Vista GmbH, a subsidiary of BayWa, Germany’s largest digital agriculture company, uses satellite data and AI models to forecast and improve yields in a project with SAP. Such tools can analyze data in ways that help farmers produce more food more sustainably for the earth’s growing population while also helping them adapt to a changing climate. They can also produce reliable data on sustainability for shareholders and government bodies.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Such data is increasingly important. Agriculture’s role in climate change was highlighted in November 2023 at COP28, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, where 159 countries signed the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action. Through <a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/food-and-agriculture">this declaration</a>, countries committed to improving sustainable farming practices and pledged to include agricultural emissions in their next round of climate targets. In addition, the United States and the UAE committed about $17 billion toward agricultural innovations to address climate change.</p>
  <p>With the added capabilities of generative AI, farmers and their advisors can more quickly and directly access agronomic data and analysis, enabling them to make near-real-time decisions about soil treatments, seed varieties, and market conditions. Using chatbots, farmers can ask natural language questions in their native languages (When should I plant this crop? How much and what kind of fertilizer should I apply?) and get answers that any farmer, regardless of their training or background, can understand.</p>
  <p>For agricultural companies, generative AI can gather and crunch even more granular and timely information and analysis that help them improve their products, customer service, and processes and operations to better meet business goals – including sustainability targets.</p>
  <p>While the promise is there, agricultural companies will need to carefully navigate four key areas as they implement generative AI:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Data quality and model training</li>
    <li>Risks associated with the application of generative AI, such as false information</li>
    <li>The need to ensure that IT systems and operational processes are set up to use generative AI</li>
    <li>Developing trust in these systems and their results so that farmers use the technology</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This article describes two examples of generative AI in use today and discusses how companies can reap the benefits and reduce the risks in each of these four areas.</p>

  <h2 id="example-1-generative-ai-chatbot-provides-fast-advice-to-smallholder-farmers">Example 1: Generative AI chatbot provides fast advice to smallholder farmers</h2>
  <p>With the increased reliance on data in farming, every major player in agriculture is experimenting with generative AI – and the first application to find traction is a virtual agronomist chatbot. That’s because the ROI is clear: the cost of providing a chatbot is low in comparison to regularly sending human agronomists to remote areas, and the potential benefits are high. Specifically, a chatbot’s ability to access and analyze data on weather patterns, plant genetics, pesticides, soil chemistry, and other areas offers farmers direct, immediate help in improving their agricultural practices.</p>
  <p>In India, agriculture is a major contributor to the gross domestic product, employing nearly half the population directly or indirectly, <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/generative-ai-already-finding-multiple-use-cases-agriculture/">notes</a> Analytics India Magazine. Yet these farms are very small; the average size is just 1.08 hectares (about 2.5 acres), <a href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/opinion/how-to-put-indian-agriculture-back-on-growth-path/113125">reports</a> Fortune India. Half lack basic farming equipment, and three-quarters are at risk of crop damage from pests and weather, according to a May 2023 McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/how-agtech-is-poised-to-transform-india-into-a-farming-powerhouse">report</a>.</p>
  <p>Digital Green, a global nonprofit that builds technology to help farmers in developing nations, began rolling out an AI assistant in 2023 with farmers in India, Kenya, and Ethiopia. The assistant, a chatbot built into Telegram, initially targets agricultural extension agents, who are professionals providing training and information for farmers. Such agents can be few and far between – the ratio is as low as one agent for every 1,000 farmers in some areas – which makes it hard to provide timely, accurate, localized advice, says Jona Repishti, Digital Green’s head of global gender programs.</p>
  <p>“Extension agents play a critical role in helping smallholder farmers get the information they need to be climate-resilient and get better yields at a time when there is soil degradation and new types of pests,” says Repishti. “But this requires them to be experts in plant genetics, soil health, new types of seeds, climatology, and market and government regulations.”</p>
  <p>In some cases, agents may spend a week to research a problem and deliver an answer, which is often too late. “Agriculture is very time-sensitive,” says Repishti. “You need the right information now or pests quickly devastate your crop.”</p>
  <p>Digital Green built the AI assistant to improve communication and advice to farmers, thereby increasing the speed and effectiveness of extension agents – which in turn will increase farmers’ faith in the agents’ advice.</p>
  <p>Digital Green expects to have the chatbot in the hands of 10,000 agents by the end of 2024. In the early phases of the rollout, the agents used it in several ways: to research across volumes of scientific reports and papers, to quickly answer farmers' questions in the field, and to present information to groups at meetings. The agents have also begun sharing the chatbot with farmers to use directly, says Repishti. Eventually, Digital Green expects the chatbot to incorporate local market data so that a farmer could ask a question such as, “What is the most profitable crop to grow, given variables such as the costs for supplies like seeds and pesticides and local selling prices for certain crops or livestock?,” according to Repishti.</p>

  <h2 id="example-2-milking-more-data-from-cows">Example 2: Milking more data from cows</h2>
  <p>Datamars, a company based in Switzerland, also develops technology to help farmers become more sustainable. Datamars initially sold radio-frequency ID tags to track farm animals, but today it has a strategic focus on both hardware and software to enable smart farming, according to Kevin Coffey, the company’s global head of smart farming.</p>
  <p>In early 2023, Datamars acquired the sensor business of a technology partner, Connecterra, which has built software that provides data to farmers, their advisors, and agricultural companies. Today, the two companies offer a service that uses data from sensor-chipped animals to create insights for farmers as well as the Connecterra software to crunch data and create insights for farm-supporting partners such as advisors and feed companies. The service helps farmers better manage their animals and in turn provides data that helps companies meet sustainability targets.</p>
  <p>Through networked sensors – “like Fitbits for cows,” says Coffey – a farmer can see the individual characteristics and behavior of each animal, including eating, rumination, and even estrus, or fertility status. That helps farmers better manage their animals, and, says Coffey, “Good farming and sustainability are synergistic.”</p>
  <p>For example, dairy farmers want the cows to be “in calf” as much as possible to maximize milk production, so they can improve collection rates by tracking estrus – which means they don’t need to buy more cows to maintain the same level of milk production. Fewer cows also means less methane, a significant contributor to global warming, Coffey explains. Large dairy processors and slaughterhouses need this information to show customers that their milk and beef is produced in a sustainable way, he notes.</p>
  <p>Given how fast generative AI is developing, it may not be long before other agricultural apps are in the field. (See sidebars: Computer Vision in Farming Equipment and Developing New Crop Breeds Faster.)</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2 id="computer-vision-in-farming-equipment">Computer Vision in Farming Equipment</h2>
  <p>Some equipment, such as tractors and sprayers, already incorporate cameras and use AI to examine images to spot weeds and spray herbicide in just the right places. This reduces herbicide use and costs for farmers. For example, John Deere uses machine vision in its agricultural equipment, Vision Systems Design <a href="https://www.vision-systems.com/non-factory/environment-agriculture/article/14293351/john-deere-uses-machine-vision-and-machine-learning-to-automate-agriculture">reports</a>.</p>
  <p>Traditionally, training such AI requires a lot of images and tedious work, says Vikram S. Adve of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is the Donald B. Gillies professor of computer science and director of the AIFARMS (Artificial Intelligence for Future Agricultural Resilience, Management, and Sustainability) Institute. “This supervised machine learning is very expensive and requires certain expertise,” says Adve.</p>
  <p>By using the foundational image models now available, which have been trained on very large but general data on all sorts of images, companies could fine-tune agricultural vision apps using synthetic images that are quickly generated by generative AI. This dramatically reduces the time and expense required to train AI to spot particular things such as specific indications of disease.</p>
  <p>Datamars is already evaluating such an application through a collaboration with Serket, a company that develops AI-based vision systems for livestock, according to Kevin Coffey, Global Head of Smart Farming at Datamars. AI trained on a foundation model might recognize a cow as distinct from a goat, for example. But generative AI could further train the model to distinguish between different behaviors of those animals and potentially identify the early onset of disease.</p>

  <h2 id="key-takeaways-risks-and-rewards">Key takeaways: Risks and rewards</h2>
  <p>Generative AI holds great promise for agriculture, but companies seeding new applications should pay special attention to the following factors.</p>
  <p><em>Data and model training</em></p>
  <p>All agriculture is local – so for generative AI to be useful, it requires specific, localized data. Climate, soils, diseases, growing practices, and many other factors differ significantly from one region to another. “The answers you get to the same question about the same crop and even the same climate conditions could be quite different in central Illinois versus Mexico versus other corn-growing regions of the world,” explains Vikram S. Adve of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is the Donald B. Gillies professor of computer science and director of the AIFARMS (Artificial Intelligence for Future Agricultural Resilience, Management, and Sustainability) Institute. That means generative AI must be trained not only on domain-specific data but on location-specific data.</p>
  <p>That presents a twofold challenge – first, being able to gather and use the data. Some data, such as weather data, is publicly available, but some, such as details on specific types of seeds developed by specific companies, might be proprietary, which raises legal risk. In addition, if companies are collecting and analyzing data from individual farms, they need to adhere to data privacy rules and make sure they have the express permission of farmers.</p>
  <p>Second, such specificity makes model training more complicated. While ChatGPT – which is trained on information from the Internet – might be a start, agricultural chatbots need to be trained on trusted data sets, such as peer-reviewed agricultural research and best practices. But since farming is local, that training also requires specific data on regional variations in weather patterns, typical crops grown in that geography, and even market conditions in specific areas.</p>
  <p>Digital Green’s Repishti says the organization has developed databases for select high-value crops. In Ethiopia and Kenya, the chatbot supports over 40 value chains, including potato and rice, which are among the major crops in those countries. It plans to expand the databases to additional crops and livestock.</p>
  <p>But static databases may not be enough to enable the chatbot to answer highly specific questions in a changing context. So Digital Green is working to enable the chatbot to connect with dynamic databases through retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as well as fine-tuning the language models to keep up with farmers’ changing needs. In this way, the chatbot could access the most recent data on commodity markets and selling prices, for example.</p>

  </p>
  <p>With RAG technology, a model has access to the most current information, helping to ensure accuracy and helping it to sync up with hyperlocal data. This means the AI model can retrieve information while answering a specific question. RAG also reduces the chances of the model “hallucinating,” or making up erroneous answers based on data patterns on which it was trained. However, RAG requires specialized expertise and technology; for example, it depends on coding that enables relevant information to be drawn from specific databases.</p>
  <p><em>Legal risks associated with data ownership</em></p>
  <p>Any company developing a generative AI tool for farmers needs to make sure it owns the data it intends to use or at least has permission to use it. A company must also have knowledge of various laws around the world that govern data ownership and data mining. For years, large agricultural equipment vendors have collected data through sensors and cameras on tractors in addition to data from farmers, so they may have legal ownership of certain information, Adve notes.</p>
  <p>However, there are legal opportunities as well. If trained using the right data, chatbots can help farmers comply with local regulations.</p>
  <p>In addition, agriculture companies, technology suppliers, and software vendors should make sure that users understand the possibility of error. While it is improving, generative AI is still prone to hallucinating. One reason that Digital Green rolled out its chatbot only to extension agents is that the agents have the knowledge to spot such errors. “The agents are another layer of security because they are experts that can critically assess the information the chatbot offers,” Repishti says.</p>
  <p>Adve notes that evaluating the accuracy of generative AI tools is difficult and time-consuming. There are good reasons that most of the large language models come from some of the biggest technology companies in the world, which have the vast resources required to reduce the chance of errors. For all the promise that generative AI holds, business leaders need to remember that it isn’t perfect.</p>
  <p><em>IT systems and operation processes</em></p>
  <p>Because farming is local, sophisticated technical tools were developed in isolation and were not widely adopted until recently. That means that much of the data is not standardized and that systems require integration, potentially leading to some heavy lifting for companies that want to gather and analyze agricultural data. For example, different countries use different codes to identify various cattle breeds, says Coffey.</p>
  <p><em>Developing farmers’ trust</em></p>
  <p>Companies need to pay special attention to gaining the trust of farmers. Traditional farming practices have been developed over many generations; often the same family has worked the same land for hundreds of years. So it is understandable that farmers are skeptical of new technologies like data analytics and generative AI. (For more on this issue, see “<a href="/resources/how-ai-transforms-agriculture">How AI Transforms Agriculture</a>.”)</p>
  <p>Clear explanations can help. State what generative AI can do, what it cannot do, and how it works. For example, describe how generative AI provides information expressed in probabilities and can make mistakes (just as people do) and also how it can take in much more data than people can. Reviewing these issues helps users understand the technology’s strengths and weaknesses – and how it benefits them.</p>
  <p>Companies need to pay special attention to gaining the trust of farmers.</p>
  <p>Digital Green focuses on gaining farmers’ trust. “It's notoriously hard to change farmer behavior and practices in the fields,” Repishti says. When farmers ask their extension agent questions, it can take time to get an answer if the agent must research it. With the AI chatbot, agents can immediately respond to farmer queries with relevant, useful, and accurate advice. In addition, Digital Green’s bot can handle multiple languages and respond to spoken questions rather than relying on one language and text. “Meeting farmers on their terms helps build trust between farmers and extension agents,” she notes.</p>
  <p>The trust factor is important even in developed countries such as the United States because the use of digital technology in agriculture is still relatively new. The AI Institute for Climate-Land Interactions, Mitigation, Adaptation, Tradeoffs, and Economy (AI-CLIMATE), based at the University of Minnesota, is researching how AI can help U.S. farmers adopt and profit from more climate-smart practices.</p>
  <p>“An important factor for this institute to be successful is to bring in the farmer,” says Zhenong Jin, assistant professor of digital agriculture at the University of Minnesota. “We are co-creating the solution with them. Farmers play a significant role in this process. It’s not just a scientist telling them what to do.”</p>
