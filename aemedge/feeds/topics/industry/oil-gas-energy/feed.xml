  <p>The average price of a gallon of gas in the U.S. surpassed $3.51 on Wednesday, according to <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=US">AAA</a>, up four cents from the week before and nearly $1 higher than a year earlier.</p>
  <p>Brent crude, a key trade benchmark for crude oil prices, rose 1.1% to $94.26 a barrel, up roughly 20% since the start of the year.</p>

  <h2 id="saps-take">SAP’s Take</h2>
  <p>U.S. gasoline prices have reached their highest level in nearly eight years prompting a spike in investment in sustainable energy, says John Tully, SAP senior vice president of the South Region.</p>
  <p>At first blush, the most recent surge can be attributed to the political tension over a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which pumps out about 10% of the world’s oil supply. But the reasons for the increase are more complicated, said Tully, whose North American region has a significant concentration of oil and gas customers.</p>
  <p>“First, economies are expanding again following the contraction associated with COVID-19,” Tully said. “GDP levels are recovering, which means more energy is being consumed.”</p>
  <p>As Tully mentions, tensions in Ukraine are only one factor affecting gas prices. Many developed countries have not invested in upgrading or expanding their hydrocarbon-related industry capacity and technology capabilities. So, as expanding economies create a boom in demand, geo-political and environmental concerns have constricted supply.</p>
  <p>“We’ve got this imbalance that creates an opportunity for speculation to drive up the price of oil,” Tully said.</p>
  <p>But can sustainable energy replace gas prices approaching $4 per gallon? Not yet, Tully says, because none of the alternative energy sources can scale to meet global demand. However, that could change.</p>
  <p>“Every time energy prices increase, you will see demand spike for alternative energy and technology investments to support growth in this area,” he said.</p>
  <p>According to Tully, there is an unprecedented interest in alternative and sustainable energy sources, especially from traditional oil and gas companies. However, if prices do not stick, the incentive to grow investments in alternative energy sources could evaporate.</p>
  <p>“People will wait and see,” Tully said. “If prices reach probably above $80.00 a barrel, and there’s confidence they will remain there, I think we’ll see much greater investment in alternative energy forms and technologies to support development. The obvious candidates to start are solar, with wind and hydrogen not too far behind it.”</p>

      <div>Motor Oil, Corinth Refineries S.A. is an energy group based in Greece. It was founded in 1970 and its refinery in the region of Corinth counts among the top refineries in Europe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The company plays a leading role in crude oil refining and marketing of petroleum products in the country as well as the greater Eastern Mediterranean region, supplying its customers with a wide range of high-quality products. Motor Oil produces 185,000 barrels of crude oil each day with a workforce of 2,500 employees and exports to more than 45 countries. The refinery, along with its ancillary plants and fuel distribution facilities, constitutes the largest privately-owned industrial complex in Greece.</p>
  <p>Recently, Dimitrios Michalopoulos, head of Industrial Applications at Motor Oil, explained how the company improved environmental, health, and safety processes. This is of significant importance to the company’s success in keeping incidents at a minimum and ensuring a safe work environment for its employees.</p>

  <h2 id="replacing-manual-incident-management-processes">Replacing Manual Incident Management Processes</h2>
  <p>For many years, incident management processes were cumbersome and manual. “We have three categories of incidents: incidents where someone was hurt like through a fire, near misses, and safety observations,” Michalopoulos said. “In the past, the incident management process was based on spreadsheets. In the case of an incident, refinery engineers had to fill a predefined form and e-mail it to our health and safety department. As there were no predefined field values, employees were free to enter texts without getting any system-based assistance and control.” He continued: “As a result, it was very difficult to generate any relevant KPIs as the entire process was manual.”</p>
  <p>The assignment of incident managers was carried out by the health and safety section head without adequate traceability on what happened when and who was actually acting as the responsible incident manager.</p>
  <p>“The investigation and root cause analysis process was executed completely offline, and corrective or preventive actions that were decided to be executed resulted from the investigation process. All of that was recorded in shared spreadsheet files and progress was communicated via e-mail,” he added. “It is obvious that the monitoring of corrective or preventive actions was a cumbersome and time-consuming task for all incident managers. The preparation of KPIs and reports based on unstructured data was a challenging and manual process with a high risk of human error.”</p>
  <p>The company had to take a new approach to overcome the challenges. “All the above challenges related to an insufficient quality of incident management. The amount of time required for managing this on a daily basis, including preparing KPIs and reports, led us to the decision of deploying a new and integrated solution based on SAP ERP,” Michalopoulos explained.</p>
  <h2 id="project-objectives-and-key-factors">Project Objectives and Key Factors</h2>
  <p>In terms of objectives and key factors, Michalopoulos identified increasing employee participation in and awareness of health and safety processes as one of the key objectives for the project. “We wanted to introduce an intuitive way to make incident reporting easier for everyone in the refinery,” he said.</p>
  <p>Additionally, standardizing incident management processes was another important objective for the company. Based on the refinery’s official procedures, it was important to Motor Oil that every employee should be able to report an incident or a safety observation. To raise employee awareness, the company also set up a rewards program.</p>

  <p>Motor Oil evaluated <a href="/topics/sap-ehs-management">SAP Environment, Health, and Safety Management</a> and determined that the SAP EHS Management, incident management application best covered its requirements. “We can rely on it,” Michalopoulos said, adding “our IT infrastructure is based on SAP. Therefore, we wanted to benefit from leveraging integrated data from other SAP solutions and be able to prepare consolidated reports without developing complex interfaces.”</p>
  <p>Motor Oil deployed the incident management capabilities with its health and safety section as the business owner. “All 1,500 refinery employees can now use the system and the interactive forms can be filled by everyone,” Michalopoulos remarked. Moreover, the solution is used by the incident managers in the health and safety section as well as by refinery section and refinery department heads, which comprise about 50 people.</p>
  <h2 id="improved-and-automated-reporting">Improved and Automated Reporting</h2>
  <p>“We deployed the new system in July 2021 with assistance from Real Consulting IT Business Solutions S.A. Therefore, it has been productive for only a few months and it is still early to determine safe metrics about the benefits,” Michalopoulos said. “Overall, the quality of our health and safety processes and the time required for managing incidents have significantly improved.” So far, Motor Oil has seen:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increased employee awareness and higher compliance with internal and external safety regulations and standards</li>
    <li>Standardized and eased incident reporting on a tablet for all 1,500 refinery employees and the management team</li>
    <li>Time savings of 25%-30% in managing incidents and reporting, thanks to automated workflows, predefined KPIs, and interactive forms allowing them to focus on higher value-add tasks</li>
    <li>Availability of up-to-date online reports with the latest incident information details, enabling fast decision-making and advanced analytics</li>
    <li>Simplified and documented incident investigation and root cause analysis processes automatically trigger corrective and preventive actions that can be monitored and tracked with regard to progress</li>
    <li>Cost savings thanks to the integration with the company’s human resources system, which runs on SAP solutions, to immediately access refinery employee details</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="new-solution-supports-corporate-goals">New Solution Supports Corporate Goals</h2>
  <p>SAP EHS Management helps Motor Oil meet its corporate goals. “The nature of Motor Oil Group’s business operations, such as refining, storage, transportation, and marketing of petrochemical products, make occupational health and safety a matter of high importance and a top priority to us. Our management’s commitment to ensure a safe working environment is absolute and permanent. We take an ongoing and systematic approach for the improvement of health and safety issues,” Michalopoulos said. “Based on this strategy, SAP EHS Management plays a vital role to us.”</p>
  <p>The company’s future plans include implementing additional software components. “Our <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> greenfield implementation is in progress and considered the digital core of the transformation process at our company. In addition, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a> was selected as our strategic tool for planning and budgeting processes at group level.”</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For over a century, utilities companies have accomplished marvels of engineering that have brought power to billions of people around the world. Without their enormous and complex undertakings, we could never be where we are today. However, modern utilities companies are under growing pressure to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. So, for the first time in their long history, utilities are not the sole energy providers, as distributed energy resources (DERs) owned by third parties and prosumers are also producing power for the grid. Lower costs for photovoltaic (PV) solar equipment and other renewable energy assets, along with government incentives, are driving the growth of DERs in the energy sector.</p>
  <p>Leading the charge toward these new operational models are prosumers, also known as “active consumers.” As a whole, prosumers demand more from their utility service providers, including more control over on-demand services, improved self-sufficiency, and transparency on their own terms. While DER asset owners may at first seem like a competitor on the energy market, the most innovative and fearless utilities industry leaders not only accept that these changes are coming but are already seizing new opportunities for growth and industrial diversification.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-der-and-how-is-it-changing-trends-in-the-utilities-industry">What is DER and how is it changing trends in the utilities industry?</h2>
  <p>Distributed energy resources include any assets used for generating, storing, or distributing power that exist outside the central utilities-run power grid. These can include assets like photovoltaic cells for solar energy, wind turbines, and local battery systems such as those on electric vehicles (EVs). Typically DER assets have a capacity less than 10 MW, are located at or near the consumer, and exist “behind-the-meter,” meaning they are on the consumer-side of power grid metering systems.</p>
  <p>These resources are in contrast to the traditional utilities-owned assets, including the remotely-located central power plants and high-voltage transmission lines necessary for large-scale electrical distribution. However, the ability for the owners of DER assets to bring additional resilience and flexibility to the electrical grid through the use of modern technologies makes them a valuable component in the market. For example, energy storage DERs like battery banks and connected EVs can be used to assist utilities companies in the event of a blackout by helping to kick-start the larger generators of the utilities companies so that they can more easily restore power to the whole network. Between the social and political pressures for a more energy-efficient future and the expectations for a more stable energy grid, DERs have the potential to optimize and bring better value to existing grid networks.</p>
  <h2 id="what-are-prosumers-and-how-do-they-work-with-utilities">What are prosumers and how do they work with utilities?</h2>
  <p>“Prosumer” is a <em>portmanteau</em> word combining “producer” and “consumer.” Energy prosumers typically remain connected to the central grid. However, they are also capable of producing and even storing energy – typically with photovoltaic solar panels and EV batteries. Depending on the amount of power generated, this energy can either be used to offset monthly bills or be sold back as surplus to utilities companies, or other energy distribution services. This model may be applied to both residential and commercial prosumers, with a growing number of businesses plugging their solar panels and EV fleets into the grid.</p>
  <p>Prosumers typically fall into three categories:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Those who optimize self-consumption rates without a direct connection to the electrical grid</li>
    <li>Those who optimize self-consumption while remaining connected to the grid</li>
    <li>Those who provide flexibility services at the systems level (virtual power plants)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Based upon current growth rates, DER assets that are connected to the main electrical grid (categories two and three above) are major stakeholders, while isolated prosumers are growing in numbers but are currently less significant to the overall energy model.</p>
  <p>DERs in the U.S. are expected to generate <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/5-takeaways-on-the-future-of-the-u.s-distributed-energy-resources-market">387 GW of power</a> by 2050. Of these DERs, small-scale solar is one of the most common forms for prosumers, who are currently responsible for <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/0?agg=2,0,1&#x26;fuel=vtvv&#x26;geo=g&#x26;sec=g&#x26;linechart=ELEC.GEN.DPV-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.SUN-US-99.A~~~~~ELEC.GEN.TSN-US-99.A&#x26;columnchart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.A~ELEC.GEN.WND-US-99.A&#x26;">nearly one-third</a> of all solar energy produced in the U.S. For prosumers, most modern PV systems are generally established as a two-way connection up and down the existing grid, allowing them both consumer power from the grid when necessary and the ability to supply it to the grid when possible.</p>
  <p>Another model for prosumers includes microgrid and energy-storing prosumers who can fit into different categories depending on their specific setup. A university campus, for example, could establish a microgrid where it supplies and provides all of its power needs independent of the rest of the main power grid. Furthermore, microgrids can generally connect or disconnect from the main power grid as needed, offering the flexibility to consume from the main grid or to function as a virtual power plant, depending on capacities and needs.</p>
  <h2 id="how-do-behind-the-meter-microgrid-and-der-energy-models-work">How do behind-the-meter, microgrid, and DER energy models work?</h2>
  <p>DER encompasses more than just renewable energy production or prosumers; it refers to any kind of behind-the-meter or off-grid power generation and storage. A familiar model is that of a diesel backup generator or a series of backup battery cells for energy storage. These are traditional examples of DER, but with more advanced technology, new systems are constantly evolving.</p>
  <p>With the growth of the electric vehicle market, for example, it is projected that EV car companies will soon turn into virtual power stations and energy storage systems. The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has made this more feasible, as smart charging/discharging can be used to charge at off-peak times. This gives the grid more flexibility and stability in terms of energy storage – and this kind of AI also facilitates lower charging costs for EV owners when coupled with variable rates on their electricity bill when they charge at off-peak hours.</p>
  <p>This increased adoption of AI systems also makes room for new energy startups looking to capture a share of the market. Competitive new startups and utilities giants alike are leveraging AI technologies to better address customer needs. AI is being used to forecast load requirements and generation capabilities, as well as for grid optimization and network planning, all of which can prevent outages, save money, and improve operational efficiency.</p>
  <h2 id="the-age-of-the-prosumer-challenges-and-benefits">The age of the prosumer: Challenges and benefits</h2>
  <p>Prosumerism and “smart,” data-driven business models are driving change that better meets consumer demands to economize, show more corporate transparency, and minimize environmental footprints. While these new models definitely present some challenges, they also provide an opportunity for existing utilities companies to integrate with this new breed of customers to provide win/win benefits across a more diverse range of product and service provisions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DER hardware, installation, and maintenance are all growing cheaper and more efficient over time, especially for PV systems. The price of PV systems has dropped by <a href="https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data">more than 70% over the past decade</a>, which helps explain the exponential growth in these types of systems. In fact, with an average annual growth rate for installations in the <a href="https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data">U.S. of 42% each year</a> over the past decade, it’s no surprise that solar represents the largest share of new electrical generating capacity for 2021. And of course, the improved performance and dropping costs of PV technologies benefit both the small prosumer and the utility-grade hardware buyer alike.</li>
    <li>Utilities companies can also support prosumers more directly by addressing their extensive equipment and technology needs by vertically integrating services like tech support and educational services for customers. This can be realized in the form of volume-discounted maintenance and installation of things like PV equipment, solar panels, and batteries.</li>
    <li>Finally, switching to alternative energy sources and DER assets also has the potential to reduce political and financial dependency and risk associated with the use of finite, geo-specific resources like coal and oil. This is particularly evident in light of the reduction in the <a href="https://www.irena.org/newsroom/pressreleases/2021/Jun/Majority-of-New-Renewables-Undercut-Cheapest-Fossil-Fuel-on-Cost">cost to produce renewable energy</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In other words, it may appear that prosumers and DERs represent a threat by taking a share of the energy market from major utilities providers. But in reality, the world’s energy consumption is only going to continue to grow, along with customer demands for transparency and sustainability. By seizing upon these trends and applying their formidable customer networks, extensive resources, and decades of experience, utilities providers can leverage and monetize DERs in order to improve their operational efficiency – and better serve their customers.</p>
  <h2 id="smart-data-driven-utilities-solutions-benefit-prosumers-and-utilities-alike">Smart, data-driven utilities solutions benefit prosumers and utilities alike</h2>
  <p>To handle the growing number of DERs being integrated into the power grid without becoming overwhelmed, utilities companies need to rely more heavily on smart utility infrastructures. These AI-powered solutions can improve data collection and management in order to inform operators of risk, inefficiency, and opportunities to optimize systems and grids. These can then be targeted predictively to augment the overall benefit that prosumers bring to the power grid, as well as the value they receive as contributors.</p>
  <p>And while there are emerging opportunities for energy sector businesses to engage with their consumer networks, low customer satisfaction with electrical utility companies in both Europe and North America continues to present an issue. With more players and energy distribution startups in the game, the expectations of consumers and prosumers alike are on the rise. The providers best positioned to succeed will be those that find ways to add meaningful support and value to this competitive and increasingly complex market.</p>
  <p>Through the use of smart, AI-powered utilities solutions, providers can manage, analyze, and leverage data across their consumer networks. This can allow utilities companies of the future to personalize customer experiences and energy savings plans, as well as develop <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/apm/what-is-predictive-maintenance.html">predictive insights</a> as to when and where customers will want to upgrade or augment their DER and prosumer assets and hardware.</p>
  <h2 id="alternative-energy-sources-and-utilities-sector-business-models">Alternative energy sources and utilities sector business models</h2>
  <p><a href="/research/passionates-how-they-are-changing-your-strategy">Growing social pressure</a>, political complexity, and disastrous climate events are fueling the drive to decarbonization. And, the desire for more efficient and cost-effective energy sources is motivating a new generation of more engaged consumers.</p>
  <p>For innovators and thought leaders in the energy generation and distribution sector, the future of their industry is highly dependent upon the provision of superior customer satisfaction. This means reshaping infrastructure and services around the customers of the future – specifically, the prosumers. If managed strategically, this can lead to a win/win for both the utilities sector <em>and</em> prosumers. To bring prosumer-pleasing solutions to life requires the ability to gather and understand a wide variety of disparate and complex data sets. And not just to collect this data and look at it in isolation, but to bring it to life with intelligent systems, <a href="/blogs/what-generative-ai-can-do-for-utilities">using AI</a> and machine learning tools to make it tell actionable stories, make insightful recommendations, and help inform fast, smart decisions in real time.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Global energy demand is on the rise – forecasted to increase almost 50% over the next three decades, according to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>. At the same time, extreme weather events are expected to continue, taxing the capabilities of an aging utilities infrastructure and unreliable energy grids. Consumer awareness about how and when to use energy is critical in order to optimize energy resources. Smart meters are at the heart of giving customers the information they need to reduce consumption, lower their bills, and support the environment.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-a-smart-meter">What is a smart meter?</h2>
  <p>Smart meters are <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-iot.html">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) devices that attach to homes and businesses to track energy, water, and natural gas consumption. Whereas traditional meters only measure overall consumption, smart meters track exactly when and how much electricity – or water or gas – is used and transmit that information to utilities in near real time.</p>
  <p>Using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-machine-learning.html">machine learning</a>, the data generated by smart meters can be parsed to determine how to lower operating costs, increase efficiency, and forecast demand. That ability to track usage, analyze it, and plan ahead could result in smart meters saving utility companies up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/smart-meters-utilities-iot-energy-water?international=true&#x26;r=US&#x26;IR=T">US$157 billion by 2035</a>. Smart meters are also a gateway for consumers to become prosumers, allowing them to produce, store, and consume energy.</p>
  <p>Knowledge is power, and smart meter data benefits consumers by helping them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce energy consumption with detailed energy usage information that pinpoints energy-guzzling activities and appliances.</li>
    <li>Optimize energy usage by taking advantage of time-of-use tariffs and replacing outdated, power-hogging appliances with more energy-efficient ones.</li>
    <li>Manage their costs with notifications that alert them when their account hits a certain threshold or is higher than usual – to avoid an unexpectedly high bill at month end.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div>With the ability to adapt and react to usage patterns and energy prices, [smart meters] could represent massive energy savings if applied to the broader population. Widespread implementation could contribute to a greener, more stable electric grid for everyone.</div>

  <h2 id="what-is-a-prosumer">What is a prosumer?</h2>
  <p>“Prosumer” is a <em>portmanteau</em> word combining “producer” and “consumer.” Energy prosumers typically remain connected to the central grid. However, they are also capable of producing and even storing energy – typically with photovoltaic solar panels and EV batteries. Depending on the amount of power generated, this energy can either be used to offset monthly bills or be sold back as surplus to utilities companies or other energy distribution services. This model may be applied to both residential and commercial prosumers, with a growing number of businesses plugging their solar panels and EV fleets into the grid.</p>
  <h2 id="smart-utilities-billing-supports-smart-engaged-customers">Smart utilities billing supports smart, engaged customers</h2>
  <p>With smart meters, power companies gain significant opportunities to improve the customer experience. Rather than relying on transactional communications around billing and payment, companies can use the data gathered from smart meters to drive communications that increase customer satisfaction, trust, and engagement.</p>
  <p>Companies can analyze this data and use it to send personalized recommendations to customers via text, e-mail, or as part of the billing process. For example, they can offer pool owners more efficient pool pumps, or encourage those with EVs to charge their vehicles when energy demands – and costs – are lower. This ability to personalize communications while helping customers save money and energy moves utilities from being seen as mere service providers to being valued energy partners. And at a time when there is rising competition in the energy sector, this opportunity to strengthen relationships with customers is paramount.</p>
  <p>Despite these benefits, smart meters haven’t quite come into their own yet. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.smart-energy.com/regional-news/north-america/75-of-us-households-have-smart-meters-report/">75% of homes</a> have smart meters, whereas about <a href="https://www.businessgreen.com/feature/4025086/getting-smart-meters-track-reach-half-britain-homes-businesses-2021">40% of UK</a> and <a href="https://www.smart-energy.com/industry-sectors/smart-meters/australia-new-directions-proposed-to-optimise-smart-meter-rollout/">fewer than 25%</a> of Australian households use them. As smart meter technology evolves, consumers will soon be able to set budgets and receive alerts via an app on their phone to let them know that they’ve left their stove on or have a water leak. They’ll also be able to integrate IoT devices such as smart thermostats or smart lighting into their home networks to better understand and manage their energy consumption. And with <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48396">renewable energy use growing</a>, consumers will be able to connect solar panels and batteries to the <a href="/resources/smart-grid-ai-in-energy-technologies">smart grid</a>, becoming prosumers. This will allow them to both store energy and sell excess power back to the grid – making them more active and engaged in the overall conversation around energy and the environment.</p>
  <h2 id="the-benefits-of-advanced-metering-infrastructure-ami">The benefits of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)</h2>
  <p>AMI integrates smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems to provide two-way communications between utility providers and customers.</p>
  <p>The benefits of AMI include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increasing reliability and better managing outages by being able to pinpoint outage locations quickly and automatically alert utilities when the power comes back on</li>
    <li>Evaluating and managing energy consumption by providing accurate information about power usage and patterns that can be used to improve customer engagement</li>
    <li>Improving data quality and billing by providing accurate readings and alerting customers to usage anomalies as they happen rather than after the fact</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="smart-meters-and-ami-support-smart-grids">Smart meters and AMI support smart grids</h2>
  <p>Increasingly severe weather events have highlighted the weaknesses of existing power grids. And the global impact from flooding, forest fires, hurricanes, and heat is expected to continue to rise. As just one example, a recent McKinsey report on <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/climate-risk-and-response-physical-hazards-and-socioeconomic-impacts">climate risk and response</a> noted that in “Ho Chi Minh City, direct infrastructure asset damage from a 100-year flood could rise from about $200 to $300 million today, to $500 million to $1 billion in 2050.” That, coupled with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/16/europes-energy-crisis-is-making-the-market-nervous-ahead-of-winter.html">rising energy prices</a>, calls for better overall energy management, which is where smart grids come into the picture.</p>
  <p>Smart grids, which integrate smart meters, renewable technologies, sensors, communications networks, and monitoring systems, allow utilities and their customers to exchange information and energy. This improves the grid’s reliability, quality, and efficiency, optimizing energy usage and catching and adjusting for small problems before they balloon into big issues.</p>
  <p>Smart grids also have self-healing, predictive capabilities. They can identify faults, isolate them, and react to them, reconfiguring energy flow around affected areas to protect the broader grid. They also can access weather and energy usage forecasts to adjust for upcoming situations. Using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/cloud-analytics/what-is-predictive-analytics.html">predictive analytics</a>, they can also anticipate future maintenance and system management needs.</p>
  <h2 id="can-smart-metering-and-smart-grids-help-eliminate-overloads">Can smart metering and smart grids help eliminate overloads?</h2>
  <p>The short answer is “yes.” The connected, communicative nature of smart meters and smart grids allows for a much more nuanced response to everyday energy use, as well as to overloads and emergencies. Smart grids use edge computing, 5G, IoT, cloud, advanced streaming analytics, and AI to assess grid conditions in real time and rapidly adapt and respond to ever-changing demands. Customers can support overload management by reducing their consumption in response to current conditions.</p>
  <p>For example, they can respond to alerts and notifications via phone apps that advise them to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce their energy use or turn off non-essential appliances and devices in the face of impending brownouts or outages.</li>
    <li>Turn heating systems down in cold snaps and reduce AC usage in heat waves to decrease the surge in demand and lessen the risk of blackouts.</li>
    <li>Save money by charging EVs and running washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, or other appliances when their power company’s time-of-use tariffs are lower.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="smart-meter-technologies-drive-greener-cleaner-smarter-energy-solutions">Smart meter technologies drive greener, cleaner, smarter, energy solutions</h2>
  <p>Energy solutions like smart metering and smart grids have many eco-friendly benefits including the reduction in diesel and gas consumption, as utilities would no longer need to dispatch meter readers in trucks.</p>
  <p>Smart meters can support:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The integration of renewables into smart grids, reducing dependency on gas, nuclear, and coal-fired power</li>
    <li>Smart technology that can turn on and off heat pumps and other appliances to align usage with supply and demand without negatively impacting homeowners</li>
    <li>Encouraging consumers to use renewable energy when the supply is robust so that excess demand doesn’t need to be met by carbon-based energy sources</li>
    <li>Supporting local energy, which is cleaner energy – a decentralized smart grid will be able to connect microgrids where prosumers sell excess solar or wind energy back to utilities or even trade it with their neighbors</li>
    <li>Evolving smart cities. While cities only cover 2% of the Earth’s surface, <a href="https://unhabitat.org/topic/climate-change">UN research shows</a> that they account for more than 60% of greenhouse gas emissions and use 78% of the Earths’ energy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But greener energy isn’t just about the power that gets used; it’s also about the energy that’s wasted – about two-thirds <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/16/how-much-energy-does-the-us-consume-where-does-it-come-from-pew-research/">of all energy</a> in the U.S. annually. Smart meters can pinpoint energy wasted by not turning off lights or leaving devices on standby to help eliminate wastage. Because the cleanest energy is energy that isn’t used at all.</p>

  <p>Like oxygen, the power grid is essential to modern life but is not always top of mind – until problems occur. Today, aging grid infrastructure is taking a beating from severe weather events around the world, resulting in power outages that threaten health, safety, and economic activity. At the same time, a number of other factors are also putting pressure on century-old grids. The way that energy is produced is rapidly changing – more wind and solar, less coal and fossil fuel. This shift requires new processes and ways of managing. The “who” is also shifting, with energy now produced not only by the major energy companies, but also by a plethora of new competitors and prosumers (consumers who produce energy).</p>
  <p>And not only is the natural world changing fast, but the technological world is advancing at a gallop as well. Cloud-connected artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are driving the advancement of smart grids capable of managing far more complex power generation and distribution. These technologies herald significant opportunity for those in the complex energy ecosystem that are able to harness them.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-a-prosumer">What is a prosumer?</h2>
  <p>Prosumer is a <em>portmanteau</em> word combining “producer” and “consumer.” Energy prosumers typically remain connected to the central grid. However, they are also capable of producing and even storing energy – typically with photovoltaic solar panels and EV batteries.</p>
  <p>Depending on the amount of power generated, this energy can either be used to offset monthly bills or be sold back as surplus to utilities companies or other energy distribution services. This model may be applied to both residential and commercial prosumers, with a growing number of businesses plugging their solar panels and EV fleets into the grid.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-a-smart-grid">What is a smart grid?</h2>
  <p>A smart grid is a network that integrates energy distribution and digital communication technology in a two-way flow of electricity and data. This enables utility companies to optimize the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. And it also allows consumers to benefit from the stories all that data is telling – helping them to better understand the energy they use and even the energy they produce and store through things like solar panels and EV batteries.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-the-traditional-grid-and-a-smart-grid">What is the difference between the traditional grid and a smart grid?</h2>
  <p>The main difference between <a href="https://electricalacademia.com/electric-power/difference-traditional-power-grid-smart-grid/">traditional systems and smart grids</a> lies in the ability to exchange information in both directions across the network, from utility companies to consumers and vice versa. Some of the top features that differentiate smart grids include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html">AI</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/what-is-cloud-computing.html">cloud</a>, and digital technologies allow all the devices and assets within the grid to communicate, supporting better control and self-regulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Energy generated by prosumers and other renewable energy sources – such as solar or wind – can be intermittent and uneven. Smart grid technologies help to coordinate, store, and distribute power from such sources into a steady and reliable stream.</li>
    <li><strong>Generation:</strong> <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/cloud-analytics/what-is-predictive-analytics.html">Predictive analytics</a> in smart systems means that high-demand strains can be forecasted and distributed to multiple plants and substations.</li>
    <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-iot.html">IoT</a> sensors across the network can help detect risk early on, redistributing power to decrease outages and help balance loads without direct intervention by operators.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-repair and predictive maintenance:</strong> Sensors can also be used to detect mechanical problems and do simple troubleshooting and repairs, notifying technicians only when necessary – <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/apm/what-is-predictive-maintenance.html">before anything actually breaks down</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer choice:</strong> More energy suppliers, cooperatives, and micro-generators can join the grid, allowing consumers to have more choice in how they receive energy.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="applications-of-ai-in-smart-energy-solutions-the-utilities-sector-perspective">Applications of AI in smart energy solutions: The utilities sector perspective</h2>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence is the driving “intelligent agent” behind smart grids – evaluating the environment and taking actions to maximize a given goal. AI is fundamental to the integration of renewable energy, the stabilization of energy networks, and the reduction of financial risks associated with instability in the infrastructure.</p>
  <p>For instance, the self-learning, adaptability, and calculation capabilities of AI have significant potential to address the intermittent nature of renewable energy. An imbalance in peaks of production and consumption are often represented through “<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/confronting-duck-curve-how-address-over-generation-solar-energy">the duck curve</a>” and can make these sources of energy difficult to control. The use of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/510/2/022012/pdf#:~:text=Smart%20grid%20is%20a%20highly,series%20of%20value%2Dadded%20services.">AI in smart grids</a> will help address this challenge by rebalancing inequity between production and consumption loads.</p>
  <p>Smart grid technologies help to make utilities sector activities more transparent and competitive. Some of the applications of AI and machine learning in smart grids include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Agility and resilience:</strong> When renewable energy is generated by new partners like cooperatives and prosumers, it is often intermittent and variable. Sensors and automation can be used to identify parts of the grid that are vulnerable and respond with automated rerouting – storing surplus energy during peak generation times and rerouting it during gaps in the flow.</li>
    <li><strong>More precise forecasting:</strong> The utilities sector faces widespread price variability due to changes in consumption. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/cloud-analytics/what-is-predictive-analytics.html">Predictive analytics</a> models can be used to more reliably predict power loads and renewable energy generation. By combining data from advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) with AI, predictions are more accurate than traditional approaches.</li>
    <li><strong>More sophisticated outage alerts:</strong> The network of sensors, meters, and actuators in a smart grid can give a “<a href="https://www.smartgrid.gov/document/last_gasp_message_outage_notification_v30">last gasp</a>” short signal transmission, including time and date, to indicate a <a href="https://skyvisionsolutions.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/sgcc-outage-restoration-fact-sheet.pdf">loss in power</a> due to partial or complete outages. In addition, the predictive capabilities of AI and the real-time data of <a href="/resources/smart-metering-helping-customers-reduce-consumption">smart meters</a> can notify operators of outages right before they happen. These systems can even differentiate between individual, street, and zonal outages.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimized power yield:</strong> The use of AI-powered sensor networks in generation stages can also be used to optimize power output. In a similar way, solar energy also benefits from AI tools to increase productivity by predicting solar radiation.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved automated switching:</strong> The ability of AI tools to predict grid imbalances and to differentiate between a brief power interruption and a full-on outage will soon allow switching protocols to be automated. This will allow utility companies to reroute energy or isolate affected areas before severe damages occur or the outage expands to other areas. These tools are a line of defense that ensures the safety of the essential equipment used to isolate and repair faults.</li>
    <li><strong>More flexible demand-side management (DSM):</strong> Peaks in energy demand put utility companies under great strain. Using AI and smart meters in homes and offices can help with scheduling, planning, executing, and monitoring changes in energy demand to ensure that providers can meet them. Doing this can have a major impact on power usage, as shown by the U.S. <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/06-09-demand-response_1.pdf">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a>, which found that peak loads can be reduced by up to 150 GW through demand management. Similarly, the <a href="https://www.epri.com/research/products/1016987">Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)</a> has estimated these smart tools could lead to a 175 GW reduction in summer energy peaks by 2030.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved security:</strong> <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/what-is-cybersecurity.html">Cybersecurity</a> is a key concern for all business sectors. And the increasing number and complexity of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/securing-americas-energy-infrastructure-cyber-threats">cyberattack</a> strategies presents a risk to both existing and new electrical grids. AI tools can help reduce this risk by detecting network attack features, malware, and intrusion and by providing network security protection for power systems. In addition, other technologies, like <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-blockchain.html">blockchain</a>, can provide transparent, tamper-proof, and secure systems that enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="applications-of-ai-in-smart-energy-solutions-the-consumer-perspective">Applications of AI in smart energy solutions: The consumer perspective</h2>
  <p>Recent surveys from the <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/consumer-survey-2020-update-consumer-engagement-energy">UK</a> and <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/three-things-consumers-want-from-electricity-providers-1/520821/">U.S.</a> show less-than-great customer attitudes toward utility companies. With the rise in energy suppliers and prosumers, utilities companies will need to leverage smart solutions to help nurture better customer engagement and satisfaction. Below are some of the ways smart grid technologies can help to improve customer satisfaction:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lower costs:</strong> AI-powered smart grid management and smart metering allow customers to get hourly assessments of their power usage – helping them to see not only when and where they use the most energy but offering personalized tips and suggestions for optimizing their typical daily routines to lower usage during peak times. It also helps prosumers manage energy production which can be sold back to the grid to reduce costs even further.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved sustainability and transparency:</strong> Smart grid data can help customers become more aware of where their energy is coming from, increasing their engagement and helping to <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ai-in-the-utility-industry/543876/">democratize the grid</a>. This can help to give them new <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50988.pdf">perspectives</a> on energy provision and the ability to choose more sustainable options.</li>
    <li><strong>Fewer outages:</strong> As mentioned, AI tools can help reduce the number of outages and mitigate their impact both for residential and commercial customers. This means an increase in security and confidence for consumers – especially as weather events and record temperatures bring fears of brownouts and other disruptions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Recently, a UK distribution system operator announced a pilot project to use smart meter data to help consumers improve energy management, optimize network loads, and reduce carbon emissions. The trial could save customers millions of pounds and potentially reduce millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions from the UK’s annual carbon footprint. This is just one example of the potential benefits of smart grids for customers and the environment.</p>
  <h2 id="big-data-in-energy-why-it-matters">Big Data in energy: Why it matters</h2>
  <p>From the point of view of both customers and utilities companies alike, it’s not simply the <em>ability</em> of these technologies to gather and manage large and disparate amounts of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/what-is-big-data.html">Big Data</a> that matters – it’s the ability to leverage and understand all that data and use it to optimize power usage and inform operations. Big Data is key to helping:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Better integrate renewable and alternative power in utilities companies by learning to predict and manage intermittence, and balance a myriad of small inputs from prosumer players.</li>
    <li>Protect consumers by anticipating outages and redirecting resources in a fraction of a second – rather than after everything has gone down.</li>
    <li>Save money for companies and consumers alike by digitally learning from past activities and using that intel to better manage and automate day-to-day activities.</li>
    <li>Provide fast, actionable insights that let utilities companies make confident and quick decisions in an increasingly competitive environment.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="how-todays-utilities-industry-is-preparing-for-the-smart-grid-of-the-future">How today’s utilities industry is preparing for the smart grid of the future</h2>
  <p>There is no question that the future of energy is moving toward more decentralized, flexible, and sustainable power provision. But we are talking about a global industry that is over a century old – and often must rely upon infrastructures from nearly that long ago to serve billions of people and their rapidly changing demands.</p>
  <p>Other challenges include complex regulatory changes, the rise of prosumers, and new startups emerging in deregulated regions. Like any journey of business and <a href="/resources/what-is-digital-transformation">digital transformation</a>, the move to smarter grid management starts with a few cautious steps before breaking into a run. Utilities sector technologies are undoubtedly powering and enabling the evolution of this sector. However, for meaningful change to occur, utilities companies will need establish strong communication, customer engagement, and change management plans including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Communicating a vision of the smart grid and aligning teams and stakeholders around it</li>
    <li>Strengthening consumer education about the changes and opportunities to come</li>
    <li>Providing win/win motivation for consumers, prosumers, and potential distribution partners</li>
    <li>Developing metrics to monitor progress in the implementation and effectiveness of smart grids</li>
    <li>Keeping the customer experience and customer retention in mind, given the additional competition and decentralization of a smart energy market</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first step on the journey is to communicate with team leaders and subject specialists across your business, to break down silo walls and find the wealth of information often hidden within. Then, look at how you can implement smart technologies to drive your business forward.</p>

  <p>From plastic bottles to the bricks and concrete that make up our buildings and roads, <a href="/blogs/the-super-materials-revolution">materials</a> determine the form and function of everything we experience in the world around us and every product we use to fulfill our needs.</p>

  <p>However, the way we currently produce and use materials is so wasteful and toxic that we’re degrading the planet beyond its ability to repair itself, with all that implies for humanity’s survival. In 2023, “Earth Overshoot Day,” the day on which humans use more natural resources than the planet can regenerate in a year, arrived on August 2. In other words, humanity now needs <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/">1.7 Earths</a> just to satisfy its demands.</p>
  <p>This situation is not just unsustainable; it’s permanently altering our environment. The weight of every human-made thing that exists, from the biggest ocean vessels to the smallest electronic components, now equals all living <a href="https://singularityhub.com/2020/12/24/anthropocene-human-made-materials-now-weigh-as-much-as-all-living-biomass-say-scientists/">biomass</a> combined. If current trends continue, this “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3010-5">anthropogenic mass</a>” will outweigh the natural world threefold by 2040. And the output of all this human activity has a negative environmental impact disproportionate to its size: we produce more than <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chempr.2020.12.006">350 million metric tons</a> of synthetic polymers (plastics) each year, but 76% of all plastic ever <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-817880-5.00002-5">produced</a> is lying unused in landfills, floating in the oceans, and defiling the natural environment.</p>
  <p>But there’s hope for a more sustainable future. Researchers and innovative companies are rethinking the materials that businesses use throughout their operations. They understand that we can no longer separate how materials are used from how they’re sourced and disposed of – so they’re creating better alternatives for existing needs, designing materials to do more than is currently possible, and inventing materials that are less harmful to the planet and even actively help <em>regenerate</em> natural ecosystems.</p>

  <h2 id="finding-alternatives-for-plastics-and-textiles--and-harvesting-carbon-emissions-for-new-uses">Finding alternatives for plastics and textiles – and harvesting carbon emissions for new uses</h2>
  <p>To remove conventional materials from supply chains, we need to find sustainable alternatives that perform at least as well, if not better. After all, so much plastic exists because it is lightweight, durable, relatively low-cost, and can be used in a multitude of ways.</p>
  <p>In fact, the <strong>plastics</strong> problem is a leading target for improving materials use. Many possibilities are emerging for developing durable but biodegradable bioplastics. One approach involves diverting food waste, with promising experiments involving <a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/creating-high-performance-plastic-foam-from-whey-protein/12521/">whey protein</a>, <a href="http://innovationnewsnetwork.com/citrus-peel-pef-plastics/10743/">citrus peels</a>, <a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/enhancing-food-preservation-mango-based-bioplastic/13572/">mango leaves</a>, <a href="https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/26-october-1-november-2020/bioplastic-made-from-lobster-shells-leads-wave-of-material-innovation/">lobster shells</a>, <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/making-cleaner-greener-biodegradable-plastics-from-waste-fish-parts/">fish oil</a> from salmon processing scraps, and <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/plant-based-vegan-spider-silk-provides-sustainable-alternative-to-single-use-plastics/">soybean oil</a> byproducts. Other sources of biopolymers come from beyond the plate and pantry, like <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/sustainable-future-scientists-rethink-plastics-and-devices">cellulose</a>, which makes up the cell walls of plants, and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/mycelium-fungi-green-materials-1.5954664">mycelium</a>, the root network of fungi. There’s even a company that crushes stone to extract <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90600241/manufacturing-most-innovative-companies-2021">calcium carbonate</a>, one of the most common minerals in the world, and uses it to replace up to 80% of the plastic in chip bags, candy wrappers, and other packaging so it degrades in months instead of centuries.</p>
  <p>Another material that needs to be made more sustainably is <strong>concrete</strong>. Traditionally, concrete is made by binding gravel and fine sand with a paste of cement (made of limestone and ash that have been burned together and ground up) and water. Its strength and durability make concrete the most widely used human-made material on the planet, but <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/1/204">making it</a> consumes about 10% of the water used worldwide for industrial and commercial activities and emits about 8% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. But researchers have discovered that replacing up to half of the sand, which is expensive and carbon-intensive to produce, with waste clay dug up during <a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/producing-sustainable-concrete-repurposing-excavation-waste/10977/">excavation work</a>, makes a super-concrete that’s both stronger and diverts construction material from landfills. Another new approach to concrete involves combining lime binder with fast-growing hemp plants to create a renewable, carbon-sequestering “<a href="https://sustainablebrands.com/read/product-service-design-innovation/3-advances-in-sequestering-carbon-in-the-built-environment">hempcrete</a>” that weighs eight times less than standard concrete and is ideal for non-structural uses like borders or sidewalks.</p>

  <p>There’s ample room to rethink <strong>other construction materials</strong>, too, as well as how to use them to design buildings with smaller ecological footprints. Renewable bio-based alternatives to standard building materials might include nanocellulose <a href="https://revolutionized.com/7-amazing-ways-we-use-nanocellulose/">insulation</a> that’s stronger and more effective than Styrofoam, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210504154557.htm">transparent, heat-retaining wood</a> made with citrus peel waste, and <a href="https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/top-10-construction-industry-trends-innovations-in-2021/">engineered wood products</a> that are as strong, stable, safe, and as versatile as concrete and steel. There’s also lightweight, flexible, emissions-free construction board made from cellulose extracted from <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2020/11/26/honext-recyclable-construction-material-cellulose-paper/">paper recycling waste</a> that would otherwise be discarded, and <a href="https://www.buildwithrise.com/stories/hempwood-the-sustainable-new-building-material">wood made from hemp</a> that’s been bioengineered to be as durable as oak, but to grow 100 times faster. And nanotechnology has enabled <a href="https://www.graphenglass.com/">graphene-based</a> construction materials that enhance solar protection, deflect wind, kill germs, and more, actively improving the buildings’ immediate environments.</p>
  <p>In addition to shelter, we need clothing, furniture, and bedding. But <strong>textiles and fabrics</strong> are often unsustainable. If the fashion industry continues its current practices, it will create an <a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/can-the-fashion-industry-ever-really-be-sustainable">estimated</a> 148 million tons of waste by 2030, or 38.5 pounds (17.5 kilograms) of waste for every person on the planet. We’ll need eco-friendly alternatives that create less waste during production, like fast-growing <a href="https://sourcingjournal.com/denim/denim-mills/us-national-hemp-association-fiber-kontoor-panda-biotech-agi-xinjiang-cotton-276485/">hemp</a> as a cotton substitute or artificial leather made of <a href="https://utenvironment.org/2020/11/05/mycelium-the-future-of-leather/">mycelium</a> fibers.</p>
  <p><strong>Other industries</strong> are also rethinking materials use. Take <strong>aerospace</strong>, for example. Researchers recently announced they had developed a new <a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/optimising-future-aircraft-with-the-worlds-lightest-aerogel-material/12625/">aerogel</a> that, while not made from particularly green materials itself, is so lightweight that it would significantly cut fuel consumption in the next generation of aircraft – while also reducing noise pollution from the engine, both inside and outside the cabin. Another recent development in <strong>construction</strong> involves ultra-white <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q2/the-whitest-paint-is-here-and-its-the-coolest.-literally..html">paint</a> so effective at reflecting sunlight and infrared heat that it actually makes surfaces cooler than their surroundings. The scientists who developed it speculate that giving buildings a lightweight, hyper-white coat of paint could be enough to significantly reduce the need for electricity-hungry air conditioning.</p>
  <p>We’ll also turn more <strong>waste</strong> into value by capturing carbon belched from smokestacks. By turning it into black <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/air-ink/">inks</a>, paints, and coatings, or embedding it in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/magazine/interface-carpet-carbon.html">carpet tiles</a> that also use recycled vinyl, waste vegetation, and salvaged nylon, we can create durable products that move greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere for years, if not decades.</p>
  <p>Finding more sustainable materials for our present-day needs is just the beginning. Materials scientists are going further by creating and using materials that expand on what’s possible.</p>
  <h2 id="materials-with-future-potential">Materials with future potential</h2>
  <p>As we investigate the properties of more renewable materials, we will find uses for them that aren’t possible with materials we’re familiar with today.</p>
  <p>For example, when certain common ocean bacteria eat a combination of gelatin and sand, they turn into a mass of <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/this-regenerative-building-material-is-made-from-sand-and-bacteria">living concrete</a> that can repair and reproduce itself. This material has promise for rebuilding after disasters and providing shelter quickly in challenging conditions. Scientists think they could even teach it to make oxygen and water, which would be useful in harsh environments – not just on Earth, but on other planets, should NASA realize plans to send crews to settle Mars, for example. Similarly, researchers are working on making building materials and tools by combining chitin, a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14610026/">biopolymer</a> produced by fungi and insects, with <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/martian-buildings-could-be-made-of-chitin-based-material/">other materials</a> that are readily available.</p>
  <p>Plants will also inspire new material properties. A lightweight, breathable textile made of cellulose fibers and <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/seacell-fiber/">seaweed</a> could be able to infuse nutrients through skin contact, for clothing that nourishes the person wearing it. A genetically tailored <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/kombucha-tea-inspires-new-living-material-for-biosensing-applications/">kombucha tea</a> starter that can sense pollutants and produce glow-in-the-dark enzymes could potentially be an eco-friendly biosensor indicating a package has been tampered with. Plants infused with nanoparticles that <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/ambient-plant-illumination-could-light-way-greener-buildings-0510">turn energy from photosynthesis</a> into light could replace lighting fixtures with ambient off-grid lighting that also freshens the air.</p>
  <p>In addition, researchers are creating partly organic and non-organic <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/animate-materials/animate-materials-report.pdf">animate materials</a> that are capable of sensing and adapting to their environments. Buildings made from these materials would be able to harvest light, water, heat, bacteria, greenhouse gases, and biowaste from their surroundings and inhabitants, then use those resources to maintain and repair themselves while generating useful outputs like power, oxygen, heat, and drinkable water. Equipment in industrial facilities could be made from self-repairing plastics and self-diagnostic coatings that simplify maintenance. Products could be programmed to disassemble themselves at end-of-life so their basic components can be recycled or repurposed. Even <a href="/blogs/fashion-the-future-interface-between-mind-body-and-planet">clothing</a> could be made with animate materials that respond to people’s vital signs to keep them comfortable or detect possible illness.</p>

  <h2 id="regeneration-the-next-frontier">Regeneration: The next frontier</h2>
  <p>In the search for a sustainable materials future, the ultimate outcome could be a broad shift to materials that aren’t just lower-impact, but that actively regenerate the environment and systems they are part of. That could mean designing materials that sustain themselves, restore nutrients to the environment as they break down, or actively remove <em>existing</em> waste from the environment as they’re created. Researchers in the Netherlands recently mixed microalgae with bacterial cellulose to create a “<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tnw/researchers-create-living-material-based-on-algae">living material</a>” that can be 3D printed into sturdy, biodegradable objects that sustain and regenerate themselves through photosynthesis. One potential application is artificial leaves that, given water and CO<sub>2</sub>, emit oxygen and store energy as sugars that can be harvested for fuel.</p>
  <p>Living materials like this could also be formed into artificial skin that speeds healing by flooding a wound site with oxygen before dissolving – or <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tnw/researchers-create-living-material-based-on-algae">fabric</a> that requires less water than cotton to produce, purifies the air through photosynthesis, and returns nutrients to the environment when it biodegrades.</p>
  <p>People who prefer less literal active wear may choose instead to wear textiles made from repurposed agricultural waste, and that break down at end of life to return nutrients to the environment. According to the EU’s Reflow Project, these garments could come from <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/pinatex/">pineapple leaves</a>, <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/malai-plant-base-leather/">coconut water</a>, or crustacean shells combined with <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/orange-fibre/">citrus byproducts</a> or <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/tomtex/">coffee grounds</a>.</p>
  <p>When it comes time to package all of these products, we can feed sewage <a href="https://www.futurity.org/bioplastics-mangrove-bacteria-wastewater-2487542-2/?utm_source=rss&#x26;utm_medium=rss&#x26;utm_campaign=bioplastics-mangrove-bacteria-wastewater-2487542-2">sludge</a> and agriculture wastewater to hungry bacteria who excrete it as biopolymers that can be made into biodegradable plastics. Sourcing plastics this way could remove a sizable amount of sewage sludge from landfills – 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools’ worth is produced annually in the United States alone – and when those bioplastics dissolve or are recycled into their individual components, we can reuse, recycle, and reform those components into more sustainable materials.</p>
  <p>The future of materials isn’t just about making man-made items more durable or designing them so that they can be upcycled or retired with less harm to the environment. It’s a fundamentally different paradigm. Ultimately, the future of materials requires us to leave behind our unsustainable system of resource extraction, processing, consumption, and disposal in favor of one where our materials restore and/or repair the damage we have done to the planet.</p>
  <p>In other words, it’s not enough to travel down the wrong path more slowly. We need to take a different path – one that actually improves the quality of life for humanity and all other living things.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS">World Bank</a> tells us that the current global electrification rate is sitting at about 90% and has risen by over 15% in just 20 years. It is utility companies around the globe that are delivering that energy and – no strangers to disruption and change – they have been keeping our power flowing for well over a century. But as the post-pandemic dust begins to settle, key players in the utilities industry are taking a good look around and realizing that they’re operating in a very different landscape than ever before. If the energy sector wishes to meet its net-zero goals and still remain profitable, it will mean addressing new players and practices and responding to rapidly changing customer demands and behaviors.</p>
  <p>When it comes to clean energy transition, the world will be looking to the utilities sector for leadership and technological innovation as we collectively strive for decarbonization.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-energy-transition">What is energy transition?</h2>
  <p>Energy transition refers to the shift from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption – including oil, natural gas, and coal – to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. The shift also encompasses the trend toward a connected network of distributed energy sources and away from traditionally centralized utilities and single sources of power.</p>
  <h2 id="decarbonization-and-the-economic-shift-toward-sustainable-energy">Decarbonization and the economic shift toward sustainable energy</h2>
  <p>In their extensive <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/carbonomics-green-engine-of-economic-recovery-f/report.pdf">Carbonomics</a> report, Goldman Sachs notes that, in 2021, spending on renewable energy projects is predicted to surpass upstream oil and gas spending for the first time in history. Part of the reason these projects are so attractive is that the cost of delivering renewable energy is rapidly decreasing. A recent International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Jun/IRENA_Power_Generation_Costs_2019.pdf">report</a> takes a look at the global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of renewable energy projects and finds that in the past 10 years “utility-scale solar photovoltaics (PV) fell 82%; concentrated solar power (CSP) by 47%; onshore wind by 39%; and offshore wind down more than 29%.”</p>
  <p>The report goes on to state that oil and gas spending is down more than 60% from 2014 and that the global oil reserve life (ratio of oil reserves to oil production) has also dropped significantly. In response to these trends, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2020/11/17/goldman-sachs-renewable-power-will-become-the-largest-area-of-spending-in-the-energy-industry-in-2021/?sh=4c2c2e4563eb">Forbes</a> tells us that in the past year “many private investment banks, including Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley MS, and Citi Bank, have also announced their strategies to reduce their exposure to the oil and gas sector. Additionally, big private equity firms are now increasingly putting their investments into decarbonization technologies.”</p>
  <p>At the moment, utilities companies find themselves in a time of increased investor appetite for renewables projects and continually lowering costs of related infrastructure and start-up costs.</p>

  <h2 id="utility-scale-renewable-energy-sources-and-technologies">Utility-scale renewable energy sources and technologies</h2>
  <p>In the long-term quest to eliminate fossil fuel dependency, there are several arenas of human activity that will need to be decarbonized over time including transport, heavy industry, manufacturing, and the built environment. However, as the provider of energy to most of those other industries, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/industries/utilities.html">utilities sector</a> is on point for clean energy transition initiatives.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-utility-scale">What is utility-scale?</h2>
  <p>We are seeing growing networks of smaller, more widely scattered energy generators and distributors, as well as greater overall demand for renewable energy sources like solar and wind.</p>
  <p>The term “utility-scale” serves as a yardstick by which we measure the capacity of all these resources. To be considered utility-scale, an energy system or network should be able to generate at least 10 megawatts or more – with reliability and consistency.</p>
  <p>Below are some of the most common renewable energy sources and the pros and cons their utility-scale implementation may present.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Solar energy:</strong> Traditional solar modules use concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies and are limited due to their functional need for direct sunlight. However, the technologies around photovoltaic (PV) solar modules (that can use both direct and diffuse sunlight) have been advancing at a rapid pace. And their cost has been declining at an equally speedy rate, seeing the price of crystalline silicon PV modules drop by over <a href="https://www.irena.org/costs/Power-Generation-Costs/Solar-Power">80% since 2010</a>. When you factor in the $0.00 price of sunshine and the steadily lowering balance of system (BoS) costs, solar is becoming an increasingly profitable option within the utilities industry.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydropower:</strong> This is, of course, the backbone of energy production for many of the world’s largest utilities sector players. Hydroelectric power is clean, abundant, and pairs well with other renewable energy sources to fill intermittency gaps. Problem is: the building of utilities-grade dams involves engineering projects of epic cost and proportion. It also typically involves contentious land reclamation efforts and the potential for disasters of equally epic proportion if anything should ever fail or burst. In other words, if the infrastructure already exists, hydropower is great for the utilities industry. But if it doesn’t, it can be unfeasible to develop.</li>
    <li><strong>Wind energy:</strong> Since 2010, the cost of wind turbines has lowered significantly, with <a href="https://www.irena.org/costs/Power-Generation-Costs/Wind-Power">IRENA</a> predicting an ongoing drop in both set-up and O&#x26;M costs over the next 10 years. Additionally, improvements in turbine technology have led to larger rotor diameters and higher hub heights, meaning that more energy can be harvested from the same wind speeds and space allocation. Wind power projects often elicit complaints of noise and wildlife threat, but they can also result in homegrown profits for landowners so they are also seen as a good opportunity for regional economic growth. A major challenge for the utilities sector is the unreliability of wind. Due to its intermittency, wind power must either be stored in <a href="/blogs/future-batteries-save-civilization">high-capacity batteries</a> or paired with more reliable (often fossil-based) energy sources to sustain the grid during times of low generation. Nonetheless, the energy sector’s reliance on wind power has risen by about <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/wind-power">25% per year</a> for the past decade.</li>
    <li><strong>Geothermal energy:</strong> Where available, this can be a highly efficient source of energy due to its “always-on” nature. And compared to wind or solar farms, it has a relatively small geographic footprint. But from the point of view of the utilities sector, this power source is limited due to the price of establishing geothermal power infrastructures and the limited availability of these sources around the world. Furthermore, the constant circulation of hot water in and out of the ground can cause seismic disruptions and lead to earthquakes – especially as geothermal power sources tend to exist primarily in areas of already-high levels of seismic activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Bioenergy:</strong> Biomass is plentiful – often existing as a byproduct of other agricultural or production industries (corn husks, manure, landfill gas). But there is a bit of contention around biomass as a fuel source. The “carbon neutrality” of certain biofuels is achieved because the plants or trees involved – when alive – contributed sufficient oxygen production during their lifetimes to offset the CO2 generated by their eventual combustion. Many also question the assertion that forests are entirely renewable resources given that they can take up to a hundred years to regrow. For utilities companies in developing nations or largely rural areas, biomass options can be interesting, but when it comes to the urban power grids, the cost and complexity of biomass as a power source makes it challenging to implement on a large scale.</li>
    <li><strong>Tidal and wave energy:</strong> In areas of dense coastal population, there are utilities companies currently making headway with <a href="https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/tidal-energy-projects-2020/">tidal energy projects</a>. However, these energy technologies are still in their infancy. The potential benefit of tidal power is enormous and virtually limitless so it definitely represents an interesting area of exploration for the energy sector. But at the moment, there is still uncertainty over the long-term environmental impact of such projects. Furthermore, the technology is not yet streamlined enough to produce sufficient wattage to justify the enormous expense of initiating ocean energy projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Batteries:</strong> The challenge of many renewable energy sources is the fact that they can be unreliable and intermittent. Utility-scale batteries can enhance grid reliability to protect against unexpected demand or shortage. Battery integration can also allow power companies to gradually wean themselves off fossil fuels with minimal disruption. However, such industrial batteries are currently produced by only a few specialist manufacturers, and while they are definitely lowering in price, they are still expensive to purchase and maintain.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart, cloud-based technologies:</strong> The application of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered smart technologies and metering in utilities can improve efficiency, collect and analyze valuable data, minimize waste, and help to protect against (and anticipate) risk. Internet of Things (IoT) networks and connected systems can also help to automate and monetize prosumer and distributed power generation networks.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="net-zero-emissions-goals-in-a-complex-utilities-market">Net-zero emissions goals in a complex utilities market</h2>
  <p>In the U.S., investor-owned utilities (IOUs) provide energy to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=40913">over 70%</a> of the population. But as <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/">Greentech Media</a> reminds us, they are under extreme pressure to “turn enough profit to retain their investors in a difficult, constrained, low-margin business.” As the utilities industry prepares for energy transformation, IOUs must address some old and familiar challenges, as well as some new factors that are affecting their sector.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Natural and political disruptions:</strong> The <a href="https://wmo.int/topics/extreme-weather">World Meteorological Organization</a> tells us that weather-related disasters have increased five-fold in the past 50 years, making disaster and climate change preparedness a costly but necessary priority for the utilities sector. Also, as one of the most heavily <a href="http://www.perillon.com/blog/10-most-regulated-industries-in-the-us">regulated</a> of all industries (more so than even automobiles, banking, or air traffic), the utilities industry is especially vulnerable to global and regional political shifts, which can often add to the pressure to remain profitable.</li>
    <li><strong>Changing customer expectations and behaviors:</strong> Decarbonization, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/digitization-vs-digitalization.html">digitalization</a>, and decentralization are changing a century-old relationship between customers and energy providers. Demand response and smart meter technologies let utilities customers reduce their power consumption at peak times in return for lower, off-peak electricity. Improvements in energy storage capacity for electric vehicles (EV) and solar panel batteries also mean that customers can generate and distribute their own power – hence the rise of the “prosumer” (producer/consumer).</li>
    <li><strong>Less control over power sources and greater complexity within the grid:</strong> In one of the world’s most regulated industries, Texas stands out for having an unregulated power grid. As a result, many renewable energy players are flocking to the state, intent on disrupting the industry with clean energy startups. In fact, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid">Bloomberg Green</a> informs us, Tesla has quietly been building a 100 megawatt storage battery near Houston and, in August 2021, filed with the Public Utility Commission of Texas to sell electricity on the retail market. With the growing availability and capacity of AI-powered digital technologies – and rapid advancement of battery technologies – it has become increasingly feasible for small-scale players to connect with millions of prosumers to create highly viable power storage and distribution stations. Further, the rise of prosumers alone can lead to hundreds of thousands of power generation and storage points being added to the grid, making it exponentially more complex for utilities companies to manage and operate.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="sustainable-and-renewable-energy-change-is-the-only-way-forward">Sustainable and renewable energy: Change is the only way forward</h2>
  <p>In the 2020s, it’s no longer a matter of “if” we should transition to more sustainable energy sources, but “how” and “when.”</p>
  <p>Utilities companies are uniquely positioned with the scope, experience, and existing customer base to rethink their business models and begin a profitable journey toward net zero. Here are some examples of competitive strategies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lean into the DER and prosumer markets and build new partnerships.</strong> Based upon what we’re seeing around the world (and even in Texas), the digital technology and engineering capacity now exists for clean energy startups to begin to proliferate – scooping up both residential and industrial prosumers and becoming energy retailers and DER providers. For utilities companies, this can either shake out as a risk or an opportunity, depending upon their appetite for innovation and willingness to partner with new players in the market.</li>
    <li><strong>Invest in smart digital solutions and nurture data-driven business practices.</strong> In the energy sector of the future, it will be data that becomes an especially valuable commodity. Companies will achieve a competitive edge by leveraging <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/business-technology-platform.html">AI</a> and powerful <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/data-management.html">database</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp.html">ERP</a> technologies to make sense of their data and to deliver actionable insights. From managing prosumers and multiple renewable energy sources to economical energy distribution and storage, utilities companies will increasingly rely on advanced analytics and data-driven practices to remain profitable and meet a rapidly shifting market and consumer base. The growth in smart technologies also has the potential to improve customers’ ability to self serve and personalize their services and usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve communication and customer experience strategies.</strong> The latest survey data from both the <a href="https://www.instituteofcustomerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ICS-UKCSI-Exec-Summary_July-21.pdf">UK</a> and <a href="https://www.smart-energy.com/industry-sectors/customer-services-management/customer-satisfaction-remains-stagnant-with-us-residential-water-utilities/">U.S.</a> shows unimpressive levels of consumer satisfaction and points to the fact that utilities companies may have some work to do on the customer relations front. Just as it’s a time of great change and upheaval for the energy sector, it’s also a time of confusion for consumers trying to figure out the best way to manage their power usage, what options are available to them as prosumers, and how to optimize the intel available from smart meter technologies. Energy providers need to partner with their own customers, just as they may need to partner with disruptive startups in order to best compete. Doing so, they can not only advertise and promote their brand but share information, increase communications relevance, and generally throw back the curtain on their ongoing plans for energy transition.</li>

  <p>In his novel <em>The World Without Us</em>, Alan Weisman describes what would happen to the world around us if humans disappeared. The book gives an account of what would occur in New York City within hours of the power being shut off. The subways would be flooded and, almost immediately, the city’s infrastructures would begin to collapse like dominos. While an extreme example, this nonetheless reminds us of how much our survival depends upon reliable and accessible sources of power – and how over the past hundred years utility companies have created marvels of engineering and invention to fuel those needs.</p>
  <p>In the 2020s, this industry is under unprecedented pressure to innovate and reform, for the benefit of the earth and all of us on it. The good news: with this pressure comes tremendous opportunity to build on an impressive legacy and blaze the trail to a more sustainable future.</p>
