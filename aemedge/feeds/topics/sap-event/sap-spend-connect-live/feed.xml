  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The events of recent weeks — SAP Spend Connect Live, a slew of industry accolades, and most importantly the trust our customers have shown us — have put a permanent smile on my face.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/about/events/spend-connect-live.html">SAP Spend Connect Live</a> in Dallas was incredible. Attendees were engaged in the conference and passionate about the important work they do. But most gratifying were my conversations with customers, who spoke about how they trust SAP to help them solve large, complex problems. Things like economic challenges, supply chain disruptions, and sustainability, along with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals: these are challenges SAP is uniquely qualified to address, and we’ve made it our purpose to help our customers tackle them.</p>
  <p>It was an honor to <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2022/11/823c1eda-4c7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">share the SAP Spend Connect Live stage</a> with Christine Hipp of Los Alamos National Labs (pictured below), who spoke about a successful transformation with SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass solutions. Likewise, we were all fascinated by Patricia Miller’s account of Accenture’s internal services spend journey with SAP Fieldglass.</p>
  <p>We came to Dallas to hear from SAP customers like these — and we were not disappointed.</p>

  <p>SAP Spend Connect Live was a great moment for SAP and the organizations that use our solutions to run their business. In fact, more than a few customers told me we should “brag a little more” about what we’re doing.</p>
  <p>I won’t do that, but I would like to share some of the accolades that our solutions and our customers have received in the past few months.</p>

  <h2 id="beyond-the-accolades">Beyond the Accolades</h2>
  <p>While it is great to receive industry accolades, at the end of the day, our truest measure of success lies with our customers. This quarter, hundreds of SAP customers worldwide — including Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group, the City of Vienna, Austria, The Pennsylvania State University, Dole Asia Holdings Pte., Ltd, and Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft — are engaging with SAP, either for the first time or by expanding their footprint, to leverage our market-leading procurement, travel management, and supply chain finance solutions.</p>
  <p>Here are a few of their stories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.chowtaifook.com/en/">Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Limited</a> is a top jewelry brand with a huge retail network in China and the rest of the world. To support the group’s strategy to drive sustainable growth empowered by technology, the company chose SAP Ariba software to build its unified digital procurement system, deploy procurement in the cloud, improve end-to-end visibility and efficiency, reduce procurement cost, and greatly improve business efficiency.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.psu.edu/">The Pennsylvania State University</a> has been using SAP Concur solutions for more than 15 years. This quarter, it chose to expand that partnership as it has seen an increase in student, faculty, and administrator travel and expense management requirements.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.dolenz.co.nz/about/about-dole">Dole Asia Holdings Pte., Ltd</a>. is a Singapore-based, global consumer food and beverage company that produces and distributes fresh and packaged fruit products. It has chosen <a href="/2022/03/sap-completes-acquisition-of-taulia">Taulia</a>, part of SAP, for Taulia Dynamic Discounting and Taulia Supply Chain Finance on the Taulia multi-funder network. This will enable the company to strengthen its supply chain by improving the financial resilience of suppliers, therefore improving sustainability.</li>

        <p><strong><em>DALLAS</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced a new survey that found senior business decision-makers expect that the unprecedented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGRNUuQiVjg">supply chain issues and disruptions that U.S. companies have been grappling with for years are not over yet</a>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>More than half (52%) of those surveyed think their supply chain still needs much improvement and nearly half (49%) expect current supply chain issues to last through the end of 2022. One in three says the issues will last until the end of summer 2023. Here’s why:</p>
  <p><strong>Global Political Unrest Is the Main Factor Causing Current Supply Chain Issues</strong></p>
  <p>Business leaders say their current supply chain issues primarily stem from global political unrest (58%), lack of raw materials (44%) and rising fuel and energy costs (40%). Only 31% cited inflation as a major contributor.</p>

    </picture>
  </p>
  <p>Looking ahead, the top three supply chain disruptions business leaders expect in 2023 are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced availability of raw materials in the United States (50%)</li>
    <li>A slowdown in construction of new homes (44%)</li>
    <li>Disruption to public transport due to lack of drivers (44%)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Cost Remains an Issue as Companies Catch Up on Lost Revenue from the Pandemic</strong></p>
  <p>Companies weren’t prepared for the drastic changes in consumer buying behaviors during the pandemic and felt the financial strain as a result. Around half of business leaders saw some financial impact from supply chain issues since the start of the pandemic, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A decrease in revenue (58%)</li>
    <li>Necessity to take new financing measures, such as business loans (54%)</li>
    <li>Inability to pay employees (50%)</li>
    <li>Missed rental payments (42%)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In order to cover the extra costs of supply chain issues, more business leaders say they’ve had to turn to wage or recruitment freezes (61%) and staff job cuts (50%). Only 41% have chosen to increase the price of their products or services.</p>
  <p><strong>How Supply Chain Issues Will Impact the 2022 Holiday Season</strong></p>
  <p>The 2021 holiday shopping season was anything but normal as supply chains were stretched beyond their limits. Although many companies have started to prepare, there are still questions about how this year will pan out.</p>
  <p>Let’s start with consumers. A separate <a href="/2022/10/holiday-shopping-what-are-consumers-thinking">study by SAP of 1,000 U.S.-based consumers</a> found that nearly half (45%) say price is the top factor they weigh in purchasing decisions, and a whopping 73% say it’s a top three factor. With inflation hiking costs and a potential recession worrying consumers, it’s not surprising that 65% plan to decrease their holiday spending budget, and 54% expect inflation to impact how they shop for holiday gifts, with 39% shopping online more.</p>
  <p>Business leaders anticipate the online shopping trend, with 73% expecting an increase in e-commerce volume this season compared to last year. To sell their own products, business leaders plan to deliver on these differentiating points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Speed of delivery (64%)</li>
    <li>Excellence of customer service (57%)</li>
    <li>Availability of products (52%)</li>
    <li>Sustainability credentials (47%)</li>
    <li>Price reductions (42%)</li>
    <li>Made in the U.S. (38%)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Companies Are Fortifying Supply Chains for the Future</strong></p>
  <p>Every organization said their supply chain needs improving to some extent, and they’re making big changes to prepare for future disruptions and to fortify their supply chains. Business leaders plan to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adopt new technology to overcome challenges (74%)</li>
    <li>Implement new contingency measures (67%)</li>
    <li>Prioritize U.S.-based supply chain solutions (60%)</li>
    <li>Find new environmentally friendly supply chain solutions (58%)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Nearly two in three companies (64%) are moving from a “just in time” supply chain to a “just in case” supply chain by increasing the amount of inventory they store. In fact, 63% think the United States should adopt this approach to overcome potential supply chain crises this year.</p>

  <p>“The move to ‘just in case’ means organizations will be storing more inventory to help meet customer demand, but doing so also means increased cost,” said Scott Russell, Member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, Customer Success. “Managing the supply chain is a constant balancing act. Over the last couple of decades, the ‘just in time’ approach traded resiliency for efficiency and lower costs, which in turn made the supply chain fragile. The pandemic and the snowball effect of related disruptions exposed this fragility, which has organizations refocused on resiliency. Still, cost remains a factor, especially in the current economic environment. Technology can help organizations strike the right balance by enabling more real-time collaboration between trading partners.”</p>
  <p>SAP helps businesses meet demand with greater visibility across globally distributed operations, better collaboration with trading partners and insights into risks, all while operating more sustainably.</p>
  <p>This is where business networks come into play. For more information on how SAP can help build better supply chain resiliency with SAP Business Network, visit <a href="http://sap.com/businessnetwork">sap.com/businessnetwork</a>.</p>
  <p>Findings are based on a survey conducted in late August and early September 2022 of 400 U.S.-based senior decision-makers in logistics and supply chain strategy across small, medium and large businesses.</p>
