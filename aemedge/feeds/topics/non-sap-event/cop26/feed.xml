    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>SAP has committed to achieve net-zero along our value chain in line with a 1.5°C future in 2030 – 20 years earlier than originally targeted.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Is this too bold? I don’t think so. The recent COP26 climate conference and the Glasgow Climate Pact gave a strong signal to countries and businesses to set more ambitious targets in order to prevent further irreversible damage from climate change. Given the climate and social crisis the world faces, we need to “go big” with our ambitions and have the courage to act, thereby living up to SAP’s purpose to help the world run better and improve people’s lives.</p>
  <p>More than a decade ago, SAP set out on its sustainability journey with the objective to create positive economic, environmental, and social impact within planetary boundaries. Along the way, we have <a href="/2021/07/cfo-sustainability-reporting-esg-metrics-enterprise-software">experienced the benefits as well as the challenges</a> of integrating economic, social, and environmental performance into how we measure and steer our business success holistically. Setting and monitoring ambitious and measurable targets while leveraging digital solutions have proven crucial to decarbonization.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

      <div>
        <h3 id="choose-both-profitability-and-sustainability-with-sap">Choose both profitability and sustainability with SAP</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability/our-approach.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Raising our ambition to get to net-zero is therefore one of the key cornerstones on our path forward to implementing our holistic approach to sustainability, which looks across climate action, the circular economy, social responsibility, holistic steering and reporting, and the many areas of interconnection.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/">2021 Sixth Assessment</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">SAP’s intense engagement on the ground at COP26</a> have left us with a deepened understanding of the science, the role of business, and the impact of SAP. With an increased sense of urgency, we recognize the responsibility, as well as the opportunity, to step up and drive a faster transformation toward a sustainable future.</p>
  <p>Leveraging SAP’s global reach, today we <a href="/">announced the release of SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a> to help companies quickly adopt holistic sustainability management capabilities. In addition, we commit to accelerate SAP’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/purpose-and-sustainability/economics/net-zero-commitment.html">timeline to net-zero</a> from 2050 to 2030 and to reach our climate goals, in line with the Paris Agreement, 20 years earlier.</p>
  <h2 id="what-does-net-zero-mean">What Does Net-Zero Mean?</h2>
  <p>Net-zero is a state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere. It has gained significant traction, with net-zero pledges covering 16% of the global economy in 2019 and recently growing to nearly 80% committed to net-zero by 2050. Because the various definitions of net-zero and how to get there have been growing too, so have criticism and skepticism.</p>
  <p>Leading up to COP26, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-launches-world-first-net-zero-corporate-standard">launched its Net-Zero Standard</a> to provide a credible and independent assessment of corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science, which enables companies to align their near- and long-term climate action with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.</p>
  <p>­­­Building on its <a href="/2021/10/integrating-climate-action-end-to-end">carbon reduction journey since 2009</a>, SAP became a member of SBTi and, in 2017, was the first German company with a science-based carbon reduction target for 2050. In 2019, SAP raised its commitment and adopted a <a href="/2019/07/sap-emissions-reduction-targets">1.5°C science-based emissions reduction target</a>.</p>
  <p>On our pathway toward net-zero, the next intermediate milestone is 2023, when <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">SAP aims to be carbon neutral in its own operations</a> – two years earlier than originally targeted. This includes all direct (Scope 1), indirect (Scope 2), and selected categories of value chain (Scope 3) carbon emissions, such as business flights, employee commuting, and external data centers (co-locations and hyperscalers).</p>
  <p>The potential for decarbonization can be amplified considerably if we enhance our efforts along the entire value chain. In 2020, carbon emissions amounted to 12,300 kt along SAP’s entire value chain (including upstream and downstream emissions) compared to 135 kt net emissions for SAP’s own operations.</p>
  <h2 id="targeting-our-entire-value-chain">Targeting Our Entire Value Chain</h2>
  <p>Reducing emissions from the use of SAP’s sold products will be the primary lever, followed by purchased goods and services. Our focus will be on the following key areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accelerating the transformation of on-premise customers to cloud</li>
    <li>Strengthening engagement with key suppliers to commit to net-zero and deliver products and services on a carbon-neutral basis</li>
    <li>Using best-in-class data centers (our own, our co-locations, and hyperscalers) with sustainable programming and a cloud carbon footprint calculator for all SAP cloud solutions</li>
    <li>Enhancing direct investments in renewable electricity as well as nature-based and technical-based funds to neutralize residual carbon emissions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The next step is to receive external validation by SBTi. We have started setting up a cross-company program involving experts from different lines of business to prepare for our net-zero transformation and will continue to make progress transparent, for example in our annual <a href="http://www.sapintegratedreport.com">Integrated Report</a>.</p>
  <p>We are not starting from scratch. We have many achievements to build on, but we are also charting new territory. 2030 is just nine years away. The challenge will increase the more we move upstream and downstream into our value chain. We will face both synergies as well as additional complexity as we interface with our further focus areas for sustainability, including holistic steering and reporting, circular economy, and social responsibility based on respect for human rights.<br>But as our external sustainability advisory panel confirmed for us, this is the right thing to do. Our net-zero commitment is one of many actions we are taking at SAP. It will take all of us to work together to deliver the outcomes we need for people and planet, and for a profitable, sustainable business.</p>
  <p>As Luka Mucic, CFO, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, and Board sponsor for sustainability at SAP, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRA6IbREmvw">noted at the end of the Sustainable Innovation Forum</a> at COP26: “We must reinvent the global economy. That is what it will take to limit global warming to 1.5℃. All of us must build sustainability into the fabric of how we do business. Only when a business strategy is sustainable itself, and is embedded in all aspects of the business, can we reduce negative impacts and create regenerative systems.”</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Back in 2010, Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that the <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us">Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)</a> is to the <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us/20th-anniversary">future of business what the X-ray was to the future of medicine</a> – without it, doctors could never see the inside of a patient’s health. Exactly this kind of laser-like transparency is needed to move the needle regarding the health of the planet, which incidentally contributes massively to the health of the economy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>CDP was founded at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street">10 Downing Street</a> 20 years ago in response to a warning by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/about/">IPCC scientists</a> that if climate change remained unchecked, the world would warm by six degrees Celsius within the century. As the number of climate-related catastrophes mounted over the years, CDP kept urging companies and governments to report on their emissions and take measurable action.</p>

  <h2 id="above-and-beyond">Above and Beyond</h2>
  <p>Today, the world’s economy looks to <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/companies/companies-scores#1ea1731978553db35dcd1469b155011d">CDP as the gold standard</a> of environmental reporting with the richest and most comprehensive data set on corporate and city action. By scoring companies and other organizations from D to A on climate change, forests, and water security, CDP helps them evolve from disclosing sustainability metrics to taking measurable actions that lead to environmental leadership.</p>
  <p>In light of the recent <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">climate conference COP26</a>, it is apparent more than ever that the private sector has a critical role in driving change and leading by example. SAP enforced its climate action commitment by moving its <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">carbon neutral target up</a> by two years to 2023. This week, SAP received a spot on the prestigious <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/scores">CDP A list</a>, which announces over 300 companies leading the way to a <a href="/">more sustainable future</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/cdp-reports-record-number-of-disclosures-and-unveils-new-strategy-to-help-further-tackle-climate-and-ecological-emergency">2021 was a record year</a>. More than 13,000 companies reported on their environmental impact through CDP, despite the continuing challenges of <a href="/covid-19">the pandemic</a>. This was 37% more than 2020 and 135% higher than when governments signed the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015. Between them, disclosing companies in 2021 accounted for over 64% of global market capitalization, including 96% of the FTSE 100, over 80% of the S&#x26;P 500, and more than 1,500 companies in China.</p>
  <p>SAP’s CDP A rating comes only weeks after SAP was named the software industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for the 15th consecutive year, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/esg/scores/?utm_source=email&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_campaign=YB21_member">identifying</a> SAP as an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) front-runner.</p>

  <p>Achieving top scores in the CDP and DJSI rankings sets SAP apart as exemplar when it comes to disclosure. More importantly, SAP solutions for sustainability help companies measure and monitor their emissions, making it an enabler for companies that want to do due diligence on their own performance.</p>
  <p>“The DJSI and CDP awards recognize Fortune 500 companies that are taking concrete steps to tackle climate change challenges. It is good to receive ongoing independent recognition that SAP is on the right track,” said Daniel Schmid, chief sustainability officer at SAP, responsible for SAP’s sustainability efforts. “It’s equally important to embed sustainability in the business strategy, so that it impacts all aspects of the business. That’s how we can reduce the negative impact on our environment and create regenerative business.”</p>
  <p>SAP customers benefit from a range of products to help them to take climate action or to accelerate their participation in the circular, wasteless economy.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/product-footprint-management.html">SAP Product Footprint Management solution</a> enables organizations to combat climate change by capturing the environmental footprint of products across the value chain so they can build sustainability into the fabric of how they do business. Last month, SAP added <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a> to its portfolio. The solution helps companies gain better visibility of material flows through their processes including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations, especially those concerning product packaging and plastics.</p>
  <p>And finally, <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2021/06/10e155de-e87d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP Sustainability Control Tower</a> helps customers meet their ESG performance targets. This solution enables integration of top-line and bottom-line management with an added dimension – a green line for integrated environmental and social sustainability insights and decision-making.</p>
  <p>The importance of disclosure cannot be underestimated. Business is still business, but in today’s challenging world, the purpose is not to just turn a profit; it’s to remain competitive, relevant, and sustainable while turning a profit. While the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2021/10/21/seeing-beyond-the-sustainability-blind-spot-can-lead-to-long-term-growth/?sh=42b874502f2e">balance sheet may not always show it yet</a>, sustainability is already material to all companies because the fortunes of business are inevitably linked to those of the planet.</p>
  <p><a href="https://insights.sap.com/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness/">A recent survey by SAP Insights</a> found that the more companies believe sustainability is material to their businesses, meaning it is likely to affect their financial condition and should be publicly disclosed, the more competitive and profitable they are likely to be.</p>
  <p>The good news is that after 20 years of running the world’s environmental disclosure system for companies, cities, and regions, CDP finally <a href="https://vimeo.com/239499952">sees a tipping point</a>. With companies disclosing and reporting more than ever before, it’s becoming easier to accelerate change, especially with the right tools and technology at hand.</p>

    <div>
      <div>COP26 was the first UN climate conference that truly recognized the critical role of business in driving change, and it was the first Conference of the Parties SAP attended. Now that COP26 is over, we can reflect on almost two weeks of SAP activity on the ground.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Building on the 2015 Paris Agreement and following the IPCC’s <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/">2021 Sixth Assessment</a> report that human activity is the unequivocal cause of rapid changes to the climate, COP26 recognized this sense of urgency. Two weeks of negotiations among more than 120 world leaders resulted in the <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_L16_adv.pdf">Glasgow Climate Pact</a>, which gives a strong signal to countries and businesses to be more ambitious and focus on the action needed to protect the planet from further irreversible damage.</p>
  <p>The Glasgow Climate Pact mandates countries to do more and strengthen their 2030 targets next year. The countries agreed on the rules governing international carbon markets, mobilizing financial flows to developing countries, phasing down coal and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and reducing methane emissions. It also recognizes the importance of international partnerships and includes language on development and deployment of technologies and technology transfer. There were pledges by groups of countries to end deforestation and move finance to clean energy.</p>
  <p>SAP’s Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Schmid, along with a small team representing SAP’s leadership in the topics of climate action, circular economy, consumer industries, and government affairs, explored how the event worked, understanding the science and engaging with businesses, policy makers, and startups to emphasize SAP’s role and impact. Given the context of <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a>, planning was chaotic and most other businesses reported a rush to finalize plans in the final few days.</p>
  <p>At COP26, we engaged in as many forums as possible across business, media, and government and were inspired by the many CEOs, CSOs, policy makers, activists, NGOs, partners, and startups. In the middle of all this, our circular economy team also launched a game-changing software solution – <a href="/2021/11/sap-responsible-design-and-production-accelerate-circular-economy">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a>.</p>
  <p>We constantly heard the phrase ‘You can’t manage what you can’t measure.’ In almost every forum, from every stakeholder group, this simple idea was repeated and re-emphasized. It was explicitly linked to the strengthening role of data and digital solutions for climate action.</p>
  <p>The Glasgow summit also saw significant business presence, something lacking in previous climate meetings. It emphasized our view that SAP is a critical stakeholder in the operating system of business and that coming to grips with climate in industry is first and foremost a question of getting transparency and alignment with the business processes that drive the problem. In terms of how the business world configures itself to a regenerative and net-positive future – another part of the COP26 business leaders’ lexicon – SAP holds the key to the door. The question is how do we empower each and every stakeholder group to unlock the collaboration and transformation needed across business, finance, policy makers, and NGOs.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Following nearly two weeks and countless interactions, it’s clear that SAP’s role is to help these key stakeholder groups with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fostering the transparency needed on material impact across the full system</li>
    <li>Connecting businesses across complex business networks and ecosystems</li>
    <li>Engaging the Global South equitably in solutions and supporting the social dimension of climate change</li>
    <li>Offering the insights needed to support the right allocation of capital to support initiatives that deliver regenerative business outcomes</li>
    <li>Navigating the complex policy environment and climate legislations that need to be delivered post-COP26</li>
  </ul>
  <p>On reflection, our role as SAP should above all support the goals of COP26 by positively advocating and inspiring action based on what business technology can do.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, climate conferences like COP26 have a simple purpose – to keep the world within the 1.5 degrees Celsius average temperature increase from pre-industrialized levels and to mitigate the impacts of climate change. COP26 has moved the world closer and kept the possibility within reach.</p>
  <p>The pact and the pledges mean nothing unless they’re delivered at the national level. Governments must build policies to give a clear direction to businesses across sectors to reach a net-zero economy, backed by substantial investments and engagement with businesses to drive multi-stakeholder initiatives. COP26 triggers consistent engagement over the next decade and beyond; it’s not a one-time effort.</p>
  <p>Our role is to help make this possibility a reality and help drive the action needed across all markets and industries.</p>

    <div>
      <div>As part of its long-standing and ongoing commitment to sustainability, SAP has joined the <a href="https://leafcoalition.org/">LEAF Coalition</a> (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance) in support of the fight against climate change. The announcement came during the World Leaders Summit on November 2, 2021, part of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (<a href="https://ukcop26.org/">COP26</a>).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP is <a href="/topics/cop26">an active participant</a> in the conference, which brings together government and business leaders, international organizations, and other stakeholders in a common cause to accelerate action toward combatting climate change.</p>
  <p>LEAF is a voluntary global coalition made up of private-sector businesses and governments to provide finance for tropical and subtropical forest conservation. With US$1 billion mobilized already, LEAF is on track to become one of the largest ever public-private efforts to protect tropical forests. SAP will contribute $2.2 million to the LEAF Coalition as it works to reverse deforestation in vulnerable areas and help achieve the goals of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement">Paris Agreement</a> to combat climate change. As natural carbon sinks and biodiversity treasures, forests are essential for all life on earth and play an important role in mitigating global temperature rise.</p>
  <p>“We are committed to being part of the solution to climate change,” says Luka Mucic, CFO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “As we accelerate our transformation to be a net-zero company, we continually look for ways to avoid, reduce, and, if needed, compensate emissions. No company or country alone, however, will turn the tide on climate change. So, it is also our priority to collaborate. That’s why we’re excited to join forces and accelerate action as part of the LEAF Coalition. We’re confident that our investment will support nature-based solutions benefitting the environment, biodiversity, and local communities.”</p>
  <p>SAP strives to be a leading example of sustainable business practices – its financial support of LEAF is just one part of the company’s holistic efforts to fight climate change and restore ecosystems. Since 2009 SAP has aggressively pursued cuts to its own business carbon footprint with a goal of being <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">carbon neutral by the end of 2023</a> while in parallel continuing its efforts to meet a science-based target to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In addition to LEAF, SAP also supports the <a href="https://www.1t.org/">1t.org</a> initiative to conserve, restore, and grow one trillion trees by 2030. The <a href="https://www.1t.org/pledges/climate-action-and-21-million-trees-by-2025">company pledges</a> to plant 21 million trees by the end of 2025 while continuing to drive carbon-reducing innovations and pursue a science-based climate target. SAP’s efforts also include active participation in a variety of <a href="/2021/07/enhancing-sustainability-people-technology-21-million-trees">other funds and initiatives</a>.</p>
  <p>And, as a leading provider in enterprise application software, SAP is also uniquely qualified to help customers optimize their sustainability performance not only in their own company but across their entire value chain. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability.html">SAP technology</a> helps organizations measure and understand their efforts relating to climate protection, diversity and inclusion, ethical responsibility, and more.</p>
  <p>“Sustainability directly links to SAP’s purpose of helping the world run better and improving people’s lives,” says SAP Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Schmid. “This means creating positive economic, environmental, and social impact. To live up to this ambition, SAP provides customers with products and services that help meet their sustainability opportunities and challenges. We also lead by example and strive to be a role model for sustainable operations and investments.”</p>
  <p>In recognition of its efforts to drive innovation and action toward the creation of genuinely sustainable markets, SAP was <a href="/2021/11/sap-awarded-terra-carta-seal">recently awarded the Terra Carta Seal</a>. The seal is awarded to companies whose ambitions are aligned with those of the Terra Carta, a recovery plan for Nature, People, and Planet, by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Thanks to consumer concern about the environmental impact of their favorite brands, companies are focused on producing more sustainable products and implementing processes to prevent materials from going to waste.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Currently only a fraction of our plastic waste – <a href="https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/the-new-plastics-economy-rethinking-the-future-of-plastics-and-catalysing">14%, according to a report</a> by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation – is collected and recycled after use. The rest ends up in landfills or in the oceans and waterways, contributing to global warming.</p>
  <p>At the same time, new regulations and policies are being established, such as extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulations. These regulations help ensure that producers are responsible for the recycling, reuse, or disposal of their products. Additionally, impending plastic taxes being proposed in Europe that apply to plastic packaging produced or imported that do not contain a specified amount of recyclable content.</p>
  <p>This is great news for the planet, but the new scenario creates a market-by-market challenge, especially for large producers, as it is very difficult to manage product regulations across different geographies. In fact, managing thousands of products and materials across hundreds of regulatory systems in multiple regions is one of the greatest complexity challenges facing global brands in the years ahead.</p>
  <p>According to new regulations, companies are required not just to design products and packaging to eliminate waste and pollution. They also must keep materials in use at its highest value for the longest possible period of time. The bottom line is that companies will need to base future decisions on sustainability and recyclability. This change is driven by consumer demand, the availability of technology, and the new regulatory environment.</p>
  <p>Manufacturers embarking on transformational journeys are often challenged by complex supply chains, heavy assets, and legacy technology. They must also transition to new business models that require a circular approach to product design from the outset and new approaches like reintroducing the product or its materials back into the manufacturing process at the end of the life cycle.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a> solution responds to the drivers behind the change and helps businesses tackle these challenges.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Stephen Jamieson, global lead for Circular Economy Solutions at SAP, says the new solution will help enterprises tackle this complexity as they move away from a take-make-waste linear economy to a circular one designed to eliminate waste, circulate materials, and regenerate natural systems.</p>
  <p>“The solution is designed to help enterprises comply with regulations,” he explains. “It’s currently focused on packaging and plastics, but it will be further developed as different material categories such as batteries or textiles come into scope for regulatory intervention.”</p>
  <p>The complexity begins with the roughly 400 different regulatory schemes that are currently in place or planned around the world.</p>
  <p><a href="/">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a> is, first and foremost, about tackling the complexity of packaging regulations and new taxation regimes. This helps brands to accurately assess and calculate those implications, use these insights to inform how products and materials are designed, and optimize these choices. This collaboration is crucial, together with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and partners, in accelerating the transition to a circular economy.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Extended producer responsibility won’t come cheap. Jamieson cites the example of the UK, where one study <a href="https://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Article/2021/04/08/Alarm-as-packaging-consultation-predicts-2.7bn-EPR-cost?utm_source=copyright&#x26;utm_medium=OnSite&#x26;utm_campaign=copyright">predicts a cost of £2.7 billion</a> per year for post-consumer packaging waste. The UK scheme incentivizes producers to design packaging that is easy to recycle and helps ensure that they pay the full net cost to manage this packaging once it becomes waste, in line with the polluter-pays principle behind the EPR concept.</p>
  <p>That is the cost in the UK alone, which represents three percent of the world. “Do the math, and you’ll see the global impact,” says Jamieson. “Some of the larger manufacturers produce thousands of tons of materials each year. In these markets, you’re talking about very meaningful numbers. And don’t forget the plastic taxes, which tally up to £250 per ton in the UK and €400 a ton in the European Union.”</p>
  <p>That may sound like a high price to pay, but the benefits outweigh the cost. Visionary enterprises like Unilever find that short-term sustainability costs can lead to long-term savings. According to the company, it has <a href="https://www.unilever.com/Images/unilever-q4--and-full-year-2020-results-presentation_tcm244-558978_1_en.pdf">cut costs by US$1.5 billion since 2008 by improving efficiencies in factories and using fewer materials</a>.</p>
  <p>In the long run, the EPR approach encourages innovation in product and packaging design. Reuse and recycling consume less energy than manufacturing from new materials. As the costs of collection, processing, and recycling are shifted from taxpayers to the producers of the materials, enterprises will find ways to cover the EPR costs through savings in other areas.</p>
  <h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
  <p>SAP Responsible Design and Production helps businesses manage EPR regulations and prepare for upcoming plastic taxes, a benefit for companies that want to get a head start on meeting their responsibilities</p>
  <p>As an example, the solution is designed to enable EPR experts at large global consumer products companies to accurately calculate the packaging fees and meet packaging regulations for a particular market. These experts must understand what declarations are necessary then ensure that they are reporting accurately to those bodies. They must assess the data, understand any exceptions and challenges to the data quality, and ensure everything is codified properly according to regulations. The solution then enables EPR experts to draft an assessment of the policies and fees at play, and finally, to run a formal declaration that will be used as the basis of the company’s payment to the relevant authorities.</p>
  <p>An overarching analytics layer allows category managers to see the projection and the implications of different regimes on their product portfolios. This offers a more strategic view for people like chief sustainability officers to see progress toward commitments, such as the elimination of problematic or unnecessary single-use packaging.</p>
  <p>Jamieson concludes that SAP Responsible Design and Production is essentially an extension of enterprise resource planning (ERP) — something SAP has been leading for 50 years — with an additional element. “Now, we’re not only planning the optimization of resources; we’re optimizing them to be regenerative.”</p>

        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announces the availability of SAP Responsible Design and Production, a solution for designing products sustainably and transitioning to a circular economy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is the latest offering in a growing portfolio of sustainability-specific software applications that help businesses increase their measurement and data management capabilities.</p>
  <p>As sustainable business regulations, such as plastic taxes, are put in place, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production solution</a> enables brands to accelerate their transition to circular-economy business practices. The new solution helps companies gain better visibility of material flows through their processes including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations, especially those concerning product packaging and plastics. As businesses increasingly develop sustainable products, managing materials and regulatory data is becoming one of the most complex challenges across the consumer industry today.</p>
  <p>“The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design — eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature,” said Andrew Morlet, CEO, <a href="https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a>. “Digital solutions play an important role in the transition to a circular economy. They enable businesses to embed circular practices across their operations, from designing products to reduce waste from the outset, to tracking the lifecycle of the materials they use.”</p>
  <p>With SAP’s new solution, businesses can embed circularity principles into core business processes, helping eliminate waste and unlock new value by designing products to be sustainable from inception. For example, a shampoo brand manager has visibility into the full product lifecycle, including their extended producer responsibility (EPR) obligations and the plastic taxes of different markets. This visibility helps the brand manager make design changes to reduce waste and decisions on how to lower the costs of the downstream reuse and recycling systems.</p>
  <p>“Every year, we use almost twice the amount of resources than the planet can regenerate,” said Scott Russell, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and head of Customer Success, “Business can play a crucial role in keeping value in our systems for longer through smart, responsible product design that reuses resources rather than disposing of them. There is inherent complexity in designing products that eliminate waste and use responsible materials, but SAP Responsible Design and Production tackles that complexity and offers a ‘gold-standard’ solution to our customers, helping to deliver circular products and achieve a regenerative economy.”</p>
  <p>SAP Responsible Design and Production, a cloud-native solution co-developed with <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-and-sap-extend-partnership-to-help-companies-accelerate-sustainability-transformation-drive-new-sources-of-value-and-lead-in-the-circular-economy.htm">Accenture</a> on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, provides tailored intelligence that enables businesses to keep pace with EPR regulations and plastic taxes, embed circularity principles into core business processes and optimize design for sustainable business.

        <hr>
        <p>Today, <a href="https://www.sap.com">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) announced that starting in 2025, all new vehicles ordered as company cars will be emission free.* Making a fleet of 27,000 cars more carbon neutral will move SAP closer to its own ambitious climate targets and complements the company’s move to make sustainability central to its solution portfolio.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As world and business leaders gather in Glasgow for the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to discuss their climate ambitions, SAP also continues taking concrete action to combat climate change. A large proportion of SAP’s own direct emissions is made up of its car fleet’s fuel consumption. To achieve its ambitious climate targets, SAP will eliminate all emissions of its car fleet in the medium term. The company also offers a range of new sustainable software solutions to support its customers on their journey to net zero, including business applications that provide transparency and measurement capability across the supply chain and a path to regenerative business models.</p>
  <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have been part of SAP’s car fleet since 2010 and today comprise nearly 20% of the total. SAP actively incentivizes employees to switch to EVs. In some countries, employees receive financial support to charge their cars at home. SAP also expands the company’s own charging infrastructure regularly to meet demand and is currently testing a mobility budget as an alternative to a company car. Employees in a Germany-wide pilot can spend a monthly mobility budget on a range of transport options, from trains and buses to bicycles, e-scooters or shared cars. The mobility budget is an additional component of the sustainable mobility strategy.</p>
  <p>“Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges worldwide, and we want to be part of the solution,” said Luka Mucic, SAP CFO, member of the Executive Board and Board sponsor for SAP´s sustainability efforts. “Our car fleet is an important factor here. We also want to help our customers to achieve their climate goals. That is why we are consistently expanding our portfolio of sustainability solutions.”</p>
  <p>At COP26, SAP presents a range of software solutions to enable enterprises and organizations to make operations and supply chain management sustainable. The SAP® Product Footprint Management solution released in September enables organizations to combat climate change by capturing the environmental footprint of products across the value chain. This way they can build sustainability into the fabric of how they do business.</p>
  <p>SAP also offers solutions specific to e-mobility, including optimizing and simplifying EV-charging infrastructure and standardizing related business processes. The <a href="/2021/09/sap-e-mobility-solution-sustainable-electric-vehicles">SAP E-Mobility</a> solution bridges the physical charge point into SAP’s intelligent suite for business processes and makes invoicing, billing and reimbursement, and accounting easier.</p>

  <h2 id="key-pillars-for-our-partnership">Key Pillars for Our Partnership</h2>
  <p>This graphic highlights the pillars where we are concentrating our efforts. In each of these areas, we are developing targeted solutions to empower companies’ sustainability performance.</p>
  <p>Crucially, all our work together aims to provide relevant support for specific industries, as companies in different sectors need to meet the needs of customers, regulators, and other stakeholders. As customers increasingly demand real progress, we are helping companies deliver on the promises they’re making.</p>
  <h2 id="un-global-compact-partnership-on-sdg-ambition">UN Global Compact Partnership on SDG Ambition</h2>
  <p>We are continuing to accelerate our collaboration with the United Nations (UN) Global Compact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Ambition. The momentum of the <a href="https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/sdg-ambition">SDG Ambition Accelerator program</a> continues to grow, with more and more companies now mobilized to accelerate both their adoption of ambitious corporate targets and integration of the 17 UN SDGs into core business management.</p>
  <p>By embedding SDG-aligned practices deep into their business operations and across their value chains, these companies can make more rapid progress toward achieving the goals of the 2030 agenda.</p>
  <p>The first round of the program successfully concluded in June, with over 600 companies across more than 65 countries participating and more than 1,200 company leaders taking part in accelerator workshops. The results were overwhelmingly positive, with 89% of participants satisfied with the program and 88% agreeing that the accelerator helped them identify new ways for their company to contribute to the SDGs. Additionally, we are about to launch a second round of the program, with an enhanced curriculum and multiple additional local tracks, including in Australia, Korea, Kenya, Argentina, and Canada. So far, more than 700 companies from over 80 countries have signed up.</p>
  <p>Accenture shares SAP’s vision of zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality. To achieve a sustainable world, organizations have to transform into intelligent enterprises, and intelligent enterprises have to form a network of intelligent enterprises.</p>
  <p>In addition to the accepted top line and bottom line, a new “green line” covering the environmental, social, and governance aspects needs to be established as another dimension of success across business processes and along value chains. This way, organizations achieve transparency and influence that span beyond even company borders.</p>
  <p>Accenture and SAP together want to help organizations to become sustainable intelligent enterprises. To enable this, SAP is developing new solutions and embedding sustainability into existing solutions along the dimensions climate action, the circular economy, and social responsibility, as well as holistic steering and reporting. Accenture is helping organizations to design and implement strategies for achieving ambitious sustainability goals by leveraging the growing portfolio of sustainability management solutions from SAP.</p>
  <h2 id="climate-action-enabling-our-customers-to-move-to-low-carbon-business-models">Climate Action: Enabling Our Customers to Move to Low-Carbon Business Models</h2>
  <p>SAP and Accenture work together to help organizations design and deliver carbon intelligence strategies that are powered by SAP solutions and technologies and address both direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We help our clients to define their decarbonization strategies and road maps. These go beyond simply achieving a target but are also intended to help sustain and monitor future ways of working. Our objective is to empower organizations to move beyond a compliance and reporting mindset, and instead harness emission-related intelligence in their businesses as a lever for growth and strategic transformation.</p>
  <p>With the SAP solutions coming out of its Climate 21 initiative, we’re helping companies to accelerate their journeys to net zero, to kick-start the decarbonization of their end-to-end processes, and to integrate carbon emissions management into their business decision-making. All this is possible through SAP Environment, Health, and Safety Management (emissions management), whih allows tracking and managing environmental footprints on a corporate level, and the recent release of <a href="/2021/09/sap-product-footprint-management-redesign-sustainability">SAP Product Footprint Management</a>, which allows calculating environmental footprints on product level at scale.</p>
  <p>In addition, numerous SAP solutions — including SAP Ariba Procurement, SAP Concur, and SAP E-Mobility — will provide additional levers in the future for reducing scope 3 emissions.</p>

  <p>We have co-developed a new solution that SAP intends to make generally available this month, SAP Responsible Design and Production. The solution aims to address two critical challenges: managing complex extended producer responsibility regulations, which vary from country to country, and enabling every organization to reduce their use of plastic, thereby contributing to sustainable and profitable growth through less plastic, fewer fines, and lower cost.</p>
  <p>Because SAP Responsible Design and Production directly leverages data from core enterprise resource planning (ERP) processes, it enables determining waste compositions and calculating EPR fees across numerous product lines as well as adhering to a growing number of different extended producer responsibility declaration schemes. To date, we have four clients testing the beta version of the new solution, released at the end of August, and they will be closely involved in assessing new releases.</p>
  <h2 id="expanding-sapio-sustainability-cohorts">Expanding SAP.iO Sustainability Cohorts</h2>
  <p>We have already seen 13 startups selected and moving ahead through the <a href="/2021/03/sapio-sustainable-future-cohort-accenture">Sustainable Future program</a> (<a href="https://sustainablefuture2021demoday.splashthat.com/">see the demo session here</a>). We continue to build on that momentum together, jointly mobilizing <a href="https://sap.io/foundries/programs/">additional cohorts</a> through SAP.iO Foundries locations in New York, San Francisco, Paris, and Singapore, where we identify, select, and mentor new startups that will bring new ideas to help solve our customers’ sustainability challenges in energy and natural resources, retail, and consumer goods.</p>
  <h2 id="enabling-better-esg-reporting-and-steering">Enabling Better ESG Reporting and Steering</h2>
  <p>Together, we are helping our customers achieve greater transparency in how they report on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. This includes addressing the data capture and integration challenge so they can successfully build an ESG capability and choosing the most appropriate reporting framework for their organization. Our objective is to help them achieve integrated reporting that captures both financial and non-financial metrics, keep up with fast-evolving regulatory demands, and create differentiated ESG value propositions for stakeholders across the various frameworks, including GRI, SASB, TCFD, and others.</p>
  <p>The World Economic Forum Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics promotes the adoption of universal and common standards and disclosures, unlocking long-term value through greater transparency, accountability, and business transformation. Based on these metrics, SAP is developing the SAP Sustainability Control Tower solution, which leverages SAP’s leading data integration, data management, and analytics solutions. SAP intends to make the solution generally available in December 2021.</p>
  <h2 id="ready-to-deliver-together">Ready to Deliver Together</h2>
  <p>Our joint teams are ready to deliver. We are helping our clients to define their road maps, identify priorities, and accelerate their journeys through the selection and implementation of relevant SAP S/4HANA capabilities and new SAP solutions.</p>
  <p>As we look ahead, we’re all focused on COP26 and the recommendations that emerge from it. To join us, <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/3d5c95bc-44d3-4c92-a775-9c5ec28ebf2d/websitePage:e228e71e-3c87-40fe-bd1a-f1a6fd7d9a52">register for the virtual session</a>s:</p>

    <div>
      <div>The next two weeks are arguably the most important 14 days ever for the future of our climate. The United Nations (UN) COP26 meeting officially opened yesterday in Glasgow and representatives from nearly 200 nations are gathered at an historic moment to negotiate agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and actions to reduce the impacts of climate change.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>COP stands for “Conference of the Parties” — the parties are the governments that have signed on to a United Nations climate change framework. COP brings these governments together once a year to discuss how to jointly address climate change. The conferences are attended by world leaders, ministers, and negotiators but also by representatives from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), business, international organizations, and the media.</p>
  <p>COP26 is different. It is considered a <a href="https://ukcop26.org/uk-presidency/what-is-a-cop/">turning point in history</a>. The parties will review progress on the Paris Agreement made at COP21 in 2015. The Paris Agreement is an international treaty signed by almost all countries in the world to keep the rise in the global average temperature under 2ºC and ideally to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, progress overall has been slow. Most countries have not achieved their Paris targets. Add to this a <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/">dire report</a> issued earlier this year that warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts, and flooding, as well as a key temperature limit being broken in just over a decade. The report has been called a “code red for humanity.” The UN Secretary General has made it clear that there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. We can still avert climate catastrophe, but governments must make COP26 a success.</p>
  <p>SAP has <a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/g20-2021/">made their position on what governments need to do at COP26 clear</a>: they need to agree on ambitious policies that will give business the mandate to drive innovation and action at scale.</p>
  <p>Last week, SAP CEO Christian Klein outlined the <a href="/2021/10/sap-at-cop26-ambitious-goals-action">importance of COP26</a> and the role business plays in chasing zero emissions and zero waste to achieve shared ambitions for a sustainable future. As a global multinational company with more than 100,000 employees worldwide, we are leading by example. SAP Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Schmid <a href="/2021/10/integrating-climate-action-end-to-end">outlines how the company is delivering its corporate pledge</a> to be carbon-neutral by 2023 and help other companies drive end-to-end sustainable performance with technology as a critical enabler in making the net-zero economy a reality.</p>

      <div>Sustainability no doubt is one of the defining issues of our lifetime. The whole world is grappling with extreme weather events, and the latest report issued by the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> shows that we are failing when it comes to climate protection. The temperature is expected to rise by 2°C as early as 2050, with a clear connection between our greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This weekend marks the start of the 26th <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties</a> (COP26), a global meeting of nearly 200 countries to negotiate ways to limit catastrophic effects of climate change. COP26 is significant in many ways: it is the first COP to review and strengthen the Paris Agreement commitments, it is the first since the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a> began, and it is also the first since the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement.</p>
  <p>What’s more, many experts see COP26 as our last chance to avoid an environmental catastrophe. If there was a moment of true emergency in the fight against climate change, it is now. <a href="/topics/cop26">SAP is actively participating in COP26</a> to support ambitious government and business action, and here are three things I hope to see prioritized during the conference:</p>

  <h2 id="reduce-and-measure-emissions">1. Reduce and Measure Emissions</h2>
  <p>Every country needs to raise the bar on greenhouse gas reductions and regeneration. We need to set ambitious emission reduction targets for 2030 to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and ensure the goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C remains within reach. And we need to carefully track our progress. Since you <a href="/2021/03/carbon-accounting-manage-measure">cannot manage what you cannot measure</a>, digital technologies will play a crucial role in this.</p>
  <h2 id="protect-our-natural-habitats">2. Protect Our Natural Habitats</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/natural-climate-solutions-help-businesses-climate-goals/">World Economic Forum</a> emphasizes the role of nature-based solutions to climate change, stating that we won’t achieve the 1.5° target without addressing biodiversity loss and land degradation. A fifth of the world’s 2,000 largest companies have committed to net-zero targets on emissions. Now it’s time for businesses to also make commitments to protect nature and in turn fight climate change and the biodiversity crisis.</p>
  <h2 id="cooperate-on-a-global-scale">3. Cooperate on a Global Scale</h2>
  <p>No country, government, business, scientific community, or society will be able to tackle climate change alone. We all need to work together to accelerate the transformation of our economies, deal with the impacts of the climate change we have already created, and bend the curve on global emissions.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we lead as an <a href="https://www.sap.com/integrated-reports/2020/en/environmental-performance.html">exemplar</a>, through our own sustainable business operations and practices, and as an enabler, helping our customers to manage their “green line” together with top and bottom lines. In doing so, we’re helping address some of the most profound environmental, economic, and social challenges of our time.</p>
  <p>Supported by <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability.html">our technology</a>, organizations can go beyond “just” controlling their productivity and operating results to making climate protection measurable, diversity and inclusion visible, and ethical responsibility transparent. In this way, they can promote sustainable business practices not only in their own company, but across their entire value chain — from tracking their end-to-end carbon footprint to ensuring diversity, inclusion, and the protection of human rights.</p>
  <p>Way too often, we think about sustainability in terms of the distant future, but each day that passes without taking adequate action is a day wasted. It is now or never for concrete global activities that can not only address the effects of climate change, but also have a lasting impact on its causes.</p>
  <p>This weekend marks the start of a pivotal moment for us to work together to do so.</p>
