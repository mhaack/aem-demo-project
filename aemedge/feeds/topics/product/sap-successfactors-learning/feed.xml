      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>SAP was recently named a Strategic Challenger in the <a href="https://www.fosway.com/9-grid-2/learning-systems/">2024 Fosway 9-Grid<sup>TM</sup> for Learning Systems</a>, a multidimensional learning market analysis model. As a Strategic Challenger, SAP is recognized as demonstrating solid performance with solutions that have a rich and broad suite of capability compared to the market.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With the widened availability of AI, the race for skills is impacting both people and organizations. While people are learning how to use AI to drive more efficiency within their individual roles, organizations are also under pressure to adopt AI technology that can deliver more personalized development opportunities and greater talent intelligence.</p>
  <p>Over the last year, SAP has made significant investments across <a href="http://sap.com/hr">SAP SuccessFactors solutions</a>, specifically in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/corporate-lms.html">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a>, to deliver these capabilities.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/corporate-lms.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These investments are part of a broader strategy to help our customers focus on accelerated skills growth and build a <a href="/2023/09/new-integrated-learning-experience-sap-successfactors">future-ready workforce</a>. Recently, we released a redesigned <strong>integrated learning experience</strong> that can deliver an entirely new way for people to experience learning at work. The highly personalized experience can guide the learner to not only accomplish compliance trainings – what they “have to learn” – and organizational goals – what they “need to learn” – but also helps to drive an intrinsic culture of learning around what they “want to learn,” tapping into each individual’s needs, aspirations, interests, or preferences based on their growth profile.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, <strong>the AI-powered</strong> <strong><a href="/2023/10/skills-based-organization-talent-intelligence-hub">talent intelligence hub</a></strong> is now available across all SAP SuccessFactors solutions. It is a framework that helps organizations understand the skills their employees have today, the gaps that exist, and how to close those gaps. With this intelligence, SAP SuccessFactors Learning can continue to deliver even more personalized learning and development recommendations.</p>
  <p>“The level of innovation within the learning systems market continues to accelerate rapidly – specifically around AI and skills,” said David Wilson, founder and CEO of Fosway Group. “As a major vendor in this space, SAP continues to invest significantly in innovating its learning and talent capabilities, reflecting its focus on enhancing the value it delivers to learning buyers as well as its wider HCM audience.”</p>

  <p>Both multinational and midsize companies leverage <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/corporate-lms.html">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a>, along with our partner ecosystem, to help drive upskilling and reskilling and create a culture of continuous learning.</p>
  <p><a href="/2023/07/san-pablo-farmacia-employees-brand-ambassadors">San Pablo Farmacia</a>, a Mexico-based pharmacy retail chain, created an intuitive and engaging training experience that employees can consume at their convenience. By integrating the learning solution with other talent management applications, it can design personal training and development plans in line with its growth strategies and the individual needs of the entire workforce. The company delivered certified training to 1,800 employees without the need to transport its people to a training location and take them away from their pharmacy stores.</p>
  <p>Delta is also embracing AI to drive upskilling and personalized development opportunities. “We are incorporating disruptive technologies like our AI-driven skills ontology that automatically incorporates industry trends with embedded intelligence,” said Tim Gregory, managing director of HR Innovation and Workforce Technology at <a href="/2023/10/skills-based-organization-talent-intelligence-hub">Delta</a>. “We can say which skills are most important to Delta Air Lines and the employee can easily combine those with their current capabilities, strengths and styles, and aspirations to create a personal career path. All of the content is based on Delta-specific skills and personalized to each employee’s career goals.”</p>
  <p>Looking ahead, we will continue to deliver more learning-specific enhancements and new AI capabilities throughout 2024 across all SAP SuccessFactors solutions so leaders can hire the best talent and grow their personal skills with individualized plans while building up the compliance and strategic skills needed by the organization.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Imagine that you’ve just been hired into a new job, but due to training you can’t really start your actual duties for a week and a half. Now add to this the fact that you’re a healthcare worker whose expertise is very much in need. This was the scenario at Wellstar Health System prior to the start of its learning management system (LMS) governance initiative.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As a customer of multiple <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/hxm-suite.html">SAP SuccessFactors solutions</a>, Wellstar is familiar with the power of SAP and knew it could be getting more out of its SAP SuccessFactors Learning solution. Danielle Mecum, manager of Learning Technology at Wellstar, believed that improved governance of the system was part of the road to getting there. “When governance is lacking, the employee experience suffers,” Mecum explained.</p>
  <p>With a nursing background, she knew firsthand the need to get new hires trained properly and quickly, and that reducing the time from hire to actual work was key. She added, “In addition to our non-clinical employees, our medical employees were taking longer to get to the patient floors to start providing care because of how the required onboarding training was organized and set up. There were inaccurate training assignments, courses not marked as required, and, in some cases, no required-by dates.”</p>
  <p>In addition, users said that their learning assignments were too cluttered and disorganized, Mecum explained. And there were instances where new employees would get to a patient floor and realize that they were not able to enter a patient’s chart, for example, because a course hadn’t been assigned to them in the correct sequence.</p>
  <p>The need to get employees onboarded faster could have been enough to justify the governance project, but to add to the complex nature of the project – and completely out of Wellstar’s control – the organization faced the impending deprecation of Flash content and the impacts of the <a href="/topics/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic. To help tackle this challenge, Wellstar decided to work with its customer engagement executive to start a solution adoption engagement. This type of engagement is intended to provide recommendations to a customer to help them create an action plan to optimize their use of their system – in this case <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/corporate-lms.html">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a>. A recommendation came out of this engagement that confirmed the needed for the governance initiative.</p>
  <p>Mecum’s nursing background helped her understand the urgency of the situation. She and her team looked at the issues already discussed and began to build a governance model. For example, they instituted a content life cycle management process that incorporated a formal method for requesting the creation of new items, curricula, and assignment profiles. In addition, they implemented an ongoing review procedure that included automated notifications to course owners to review material that had reached expiration. Additionally, Wellstar leveraged and configured custom fields within SAP SuccessFactors Learning to track key data and report on it from within the system to ensure compliance with the new governance process.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Other governance steps included reviewing and consolidating LMS admin roles to ensure the right administrators had the right permissions to perform administrative tasks as appropriate in the system – without giving them freedom to add to the problem at large. A formal process for vetting new LMS administrators was created to ensure they weren’t simply giving just anyone these permissions. “We knew we needed to define what goes into the system, so we could control what comes out. This helps when we need to get rid of old, outdated courses,” Mecum explained.</p>
  <p>These changes, among others, were implemented as part of the governance initiative. The result is that Wellstar is now reaping greater benefits from <a href="/topics/sap-successfactors-learning">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a> and, most importantly, employees now have an improved experience with the system. Frustration levels are down and new hires are able to start their actual jobs much sooner than before – in three days rather than a week and a half!</p>

    <div>
      <div>The hiring market continues to heat up, anxious employees are making retention more challenging, and workers expect more flexibility in their work environments. How can businesses provide the right tools, experiences, and capabilities necessary to create a workplace in which employees can thrive?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In today’s changing world of work, employees expect better experiences – especially when it comes to their learning, development, and growth. However, employees struggle with multiple outdated or inadequate systems and tools that create a fragmented digital experience at work.</p>
  <p>The pressure is undoubtedly on executives, organizational leaders, and their HR teams to fill those gaps to create a workplace culture that is motivating, empowering, and fulfilling. They are expected to provide personalized work experiences that include access to individualized learning and growth, guided and simplified technology interfaces, continuous process improvements, embedded listening, and increased productivity and efficiency.</p>
  <p>Organizations that deliver on these promises exceptionally well are usually more effective in attracting, retaining, and developing the best talent. However, this is easier said than done because no single definition of an ideal workplace meets everyone’s expectations. To create a truly empowering, engaging, and enriching environment, decision-makers must consider the unique locations, job roles, personal responsibilities, and situations that each employee faces daily.</p>
  <p>At SAP SuccessFactors, we understand the importance of fostering an environment where people are thriving, collaborating, and ready to succeed today and tomorrow – no matter where they work. And in virtually every case, that experience begins with technologies that cater to each employee’s whole self even as they evolve, making everyone consistently feel valued, heard, and recognized.</p>

  <h2 id="personalized-integrated-experience">Personalized, Integrated Experience</h2>
  <p>A good starting point is giving employees the freedom to reimagine their work experience with hyper-personalized, team-centric, and project-focused workspaces created through the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/workzone-hr.html">SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone solution</a>. This integrated digital experience connects the entire SAP software landscape and third-party applications to help streamline work and intelligently surface relevant content, recommendations, insights, and actions.</p>
  <p>By providing employees with a more simplified and unified digital experience tailored to their unique needs, SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone can enable companies to increase employee productivity and efficiency.</p>
  <p>For example, <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/11/90572075-047e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">AKT Solutions Limited</a> (AKT Global) resolved the presence of inefficient communication and collaboration across borders and time zones to improve productivity and lower employee stress. As a result, its employees work smarter and faster now that they have 24/7 access to everything they need to keep up with changes – no matter where they work, what device they use, or where they are based.</p>
  <h2 id="culture-of-continuous-and-agile-learning">Culture of Continuous and Agile Learning</h2>
  <p>Employees need on-demand access to individualized and engaging learning programs as part of their everyday experience. With learning established as a priority in the workspace, they are empowered to develop skills at their convenience and participate in opportunities to further develop their expertise and leadership abilities.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/corporate-lms.html">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a> helps to foster a continuous and agile culture with learning that is personalized and relevant for each employee while being embedded into daily activities. Through learning workspaces employees can get access to relevant learning applications, information, collaboration tools, and content from any source – all through a single entry point and embedded into the flow of work – to be able to benefit from a more simplified and contextual way of learning. Organizations can then help ensure their people feel empowered to own their career path and growth while helping them become more engaged and develop the skills that align with current and future business needs.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/10/90d46430-007e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Rich Products Corporation</a> (Rich’s) is taking advantage of the solution to support a culture of continuous learning.

  <p>According to joint research from <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/technology-and-the-future-of-work/importance-of-investing-in-employees.html">Deloitte Consulting and the MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, making job opportunities visible and accessible in the workforce helps improve retention by aligning employee interests with strategic priorities. But first, most companies require a conscious shift that embraces each employee’s whole self – who they are today, who they are becoming, and the value they bring as individuals.</p>
  <p>By adding the <a href="/2021/10/sap-successfactors-opportunity-marketplace-drives-internal-mobility-and-upskilling-to-help-organizations-future-proof-their-business">SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace</a> solution to their workspace, employees can find short-term assignments, fellowships, learning recommendations, and mentors. The solution can empower everyone across the organization to pursue multiple opportunities for professional development, networking, and project participation.</p>
  <h2 id="meaningful-work-shaped-by-real-time-feedback">Meaningful Work Shaped by Real-Time Feedback</h2>
  <p>Measuring work experiences helps businesses remain agile and strive to give employees what they need to feel supported, productive, and engaged. With <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/human-resources-hcm/employee-experience-management.html?sort=title_asc&#x26;tab=all">Experience Management solutions from SAP and Qualtrics</a>, organizations can evaluate how employees are doing, listen to their feedback, and respond to their concerns quickly and effectively.</p>
  <p>To enable a people-centric business transformation, luxury retailer <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2019/12/de86ec87-767d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Chalhoub Group</a> combines employee experience data with operational HR data. This approach allows the business to gain new insights, identify areas for improvement, and foster a culture where all employees are engaged and fully equipped to provide exceptional customer service. Chalhoub uses Experience Management solutions from SAP and Qualtrics to actively listen to its workforce and provide the right training, processes, and tools. The company is capturing feedback at every interaction touchpoint and discovering new ways to meet unique employee needs and continuously improve everyday work experiences.</p>
  <p>As a result, the company is redesigning and optimizing key aspects of the employee journey. For example, its HR transformation priorities are supported by hard data on the issues that employees really care about, driving greater emphasis on employee well-being and recognition as top strategic goals.</p>
  <h2 id="all-wrapped-with-a-human-experience">All Wrapped with a Human Experience</h2>
  <p>HR organizations are constantly challenging their business executives and organizational managers. They know that seemingly adequate access to technology is no guarantee that an employee’s specific needs are met. Meanwhile, it is understood that remote and <a href="/2021/08/essential-but-under-supported-improving-deskless-worker-experience">deskless workers</a> face even more complexity in their experiences, such as limited bandwidth and privacy controls, as they juggle work with their personal circumstances.</p>
  <p>With SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone, SAP SuccessFactors Learning, SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace, and Experience Management solutions from SAP and Qualtrics, organizations can deliver engaging, individualized experiences that enable everyone to thrive.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Thanks to its wide portfolio of personal and commercial banking services, <a href="https://www.scotiabank.com/">Scotiabank</a> is a preferred bank across Canada and around the world. But its true competitive advantage lies in its 90,000 employees, affectionately known as “Scotiabankers.” Every day at Scotiabank, employees are provided with cutting-edge learning and career opportunities that create a meaningful employee experience.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As a result, not only do customers prefer to do business with Scotiabank, but the company’s own employees see Scotiabank as an employer of choice too, according to Barb Mason, group head and chief human resources officer at Scotiabank.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Should employers hire candidates with a strong desire to learn, or try to nurture this quality in all its employees? According to Mason, it’s a bit of both. Too often, employees aren’t afforded the opportunity to learn on the job and grow their skill set – especially women and people of color.</p>
  <p>“For us, it is all about ensuring that we have systemically equitable processes in the bank to allow everyone to have the same opportunities and understand what they need to do to be able to get these opportunities,” Mason said.</p>
  <p>Scotiabank embraces equitable hiring processes that set a standard for equity for the rest of the employee life cycle. This begins with diverse interview teams who strive to ask unbiased interview questions and follow other best practices for inclusive recruitment.</p>
  <p>From the start, Scotiabank lets its employees know it is dedicated to providing next-level learning and skill-building experiences. Throughout the recruitment and interview process, HR leaders open the door to a world of on-the-job learning for candidates. With a modern learning experience similar to employees’ favorite video streaming services, Scotiabank’s workforce can tap into on-demand learning and training built on Blend by TalenTeam powered by <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/corporate-lms.html">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="creating-the-highest-performing-workforce-to-date">Creating the Highest Performing Workforce to Date</h2>
  <p>Mason knows that learning doesn’t do any employees – or the business – any good if people don’t know how to access learning resources. In addition to making these resources readily available to employees as part of the company’s next-generation HR experience, Scotiabank also readily provides opportunities for experiential learning for directors and above.</p>
  <p>During hypothetical scenarios, employees have the chance to tackle new tasks set at a level above their current role at Scotiabank. For instance, a mid-level bank officer may have to resolve a simulated customer challenge that is usually handled by a senior officer. Employees get to learn new skills on the fly, and the company gets to see employees’ aptitude for performing in a new role. “It’s not a pass or fail,” said Mason. “It’s an experience.”</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the Scotia Inspire program, enabled by <a href="https://www.sap.com/programs/experience-wins.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a>, empowers women in senior positions to participate in mentoring and sponsorship for the next level of women at Scotiabank. This begins at the very top, with women in the executive suite enabling leaders to mentor women in every other role across the business.</p>
  <p>“We now have the highest caliber performance of women that we’ve ever had in the history of the organization, and I don’t see that ever changing,” said Mason.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>For employees at leading Canadian courier company Purolator Inc., the last few years have seen unprecedented change. The <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic resulted in a surge in demand for e-commerce delivery services, resulting in a shift away from a primarily business-to-business model and exponential growth for the company. Meanwhile, innovative technologies such as robotic process automation (RPA) and Internet of Things (IoT)-based tools are fundamentally changing ways of working.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To continue to adapt to a new business environment and compete and succeed in the market, Purolator knew it needed to focus on supporting and enabling its frontline personnel. Managers play a crucial role helping workers get accustomed to new technologies and deliver services that meet the high expectations of today’s consumers. However, mostly recruited for their operational, technical, and project management skills, many managers didn’t have the skills required to become transformational leaders and agents of change.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="filling-skills-gaps-to-transform-managers-into-leaders">Filling Skills Gaps to Transform Managers into Leaders</h2>
  <p>To help managers lead workers successfully through a digital transformation and foster a more engaged workforce, the courier firm launched its “Evolve” program in 2018. This leadership development initiative involves multifunctional groups of over 20 managers who receive 10 days of on-site training over a five-month period. In between sessions, participants are able to apply learned skills and competencies in the workplace while skills are reinforced by online microlearning modules and coaching using the SAP SuccessFactors Learning solution.</p>
  <p>Getting feedback from course participants to enable continuous improvement for the learning experience has been a key part of Purolator’s strategy. To achieve this, the company uses <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/human-resources-hcm/employee-experience-management.html">Experience Management solutions from SAP and Qualtrics</a> to capture feedback before, during, and after the course. In this way, Purolator is able to learn about participant expectations and discover what is going right and how the training experience can be improved.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So far, more than 200 participants – most of them in frontline manager roles – have become leaders thanks to the Evolve program. These managers are supporting and guiding their teams through the company’s digital transformation and helping them learn how to use new technologies. This has enabled the company to change the way it does business without having to look outside its existing workforce for the necessary digital skills.</p>
  <p>Continuous improvement projects initiated during the program have also yielded significant benefits for the company. In response to issues identified by the participants themselves, the projects involved the design and implementation of a solution using change management concepts learned during the course.</p>
  <p>“Overall, the program has generated over CAD 21 million in saved revenue,” comments Tennyson Devoe, senior director of Safety and Organizational Excellence at Purolator. “Furthermore, we’ve seen a significant reduction in our injury frequency rate and improved union relations.”</p>
  <p>Another important benefit is increased cross-functional collaboration with the program nurturing strong relationships between managers from different areas of the business.</p>
  <p>“Even a few years after completing the program, participants still keep in touch using SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management Suite,” confirms Devoe. “This means they can share ideas and reach out for support when they need it.”</p>
  <p>The Evolve program has won numerous national and international awards, including four gold awards at the 2020 Brandon Hall Group Excellence in Leadership Development Awards.</p>
  <h2 id="navigating-uncertain-times-through-strong-leadership">Navigating Uncertain Times through Strong Leadership</h2>
  <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic prompting a significant increase in business volume and the hiring of thousands of new drivers, the ability of Purolator’s employees to adapt to rapid change has been tested over the last two years. Despite these challenges, the lessons learned by the alumni of the Evolve program have helped the company navigate through uncertain times.</p>
  <p>“We now have a frontline workforce that has successfully adapted to running digitalized processes,” concludes Devoe. “What’s more, thanks to the strong leadership of our managers, our employees now have the confidence to view change as an opportunity to learn and grow.”</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>As a leading youth charity in the UK, The Prince’s Trust helps young people get into jobs, education, and training. <a href="https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/">The Trust</a> offers free courses, grants, and mentoring opportunities to inspire those aged 11 to 30 to build their confidence, gain new skills, and change their lives for the better. Founded by HRH The Prince of Wales in 1976, the Trust has helped more than 1 million young people to date.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Our employees and volunteers are incredibly passionate about helping young people reach their full potential,” said Kimberley Cleland, director of People and Learning at The Prince’s Trust. “Our job in HR is to nurture that drive and enthusiasm, and equip staff with the tools that will help them support young people.”</p>
  <p>To enable employees to work as efficiently and effectively as possible, the Trust wanted to provide the very best working experience. By moving to cloud-based <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/human-resources-hcm.html">SAP SuccessFactors solutions</a>, the Trust transformed its HR function, delivering intuitive employee self-services, supported by a modern, digital platform. Employees are delighted with the convenience and simplicity of self-service HR, while the Trust has cut costs and improved HR efficiency.</p>
  <p>Today, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/employee-central-hris.html">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central solution</a> serves as the master record for all employee data, including training information, and for Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks. DBS checks are carried out by a UK government agency to establish a person’s criminal record history, helping employers to make safer recruitment decisions to prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups. The Prince’s Trust built custom portals in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central to manage employees’ DBS check status. Automatic alerts are triggered when DBS checks near their expiration date, enabling managers to apply for new checks in a timely manner.</p>
  <p>In addition, the move to SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central is enabling further HR benefits. For example, The Prince’s Trust can respond rapidly to requests from funding partners for information, helping to secure much-needed donations. Similarly, centralized recruiting processes have helped the Trust to make smarter hiring decisions across the organization and reduce reliance on external agencies, freeing up precious resources to invest in youth services.</p>
  <p>The SAP SuccessFactors solutions also underpin the Trust’s new employee development strategy, which is designed to equip staff with the competencies they need to support young people, such as mentoring and conflict resolution skills. Using the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/corporate-lms.html">SAP SuccessFactors Learning solution</a>, employees now have access to a central catalog of digital training programs, and the HR team can track course completion, helping to ensure that all employees undertake mandatory and career-progression training.</p>
  <p>With integrated, automated processes covering the entire employee life cycle, SAP SuccessFactors solutions have laid the foundation for efficient, user-friendly HR operations.</p>
  <p>Kimberley Cleland concludes, “With the SAP SuccessFactors solutions, everyone at The Prince’s Trust has all the information they need at their fingertips. Ultimately, this helps us get the right people with the right skills out in the field to provide life-changing support to help young people realize their potential.”</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Even during these most challenging of times for the airline and tourism sectors, the pride and fulfillment felt by employees of Canada’s Transat A.T. Inc. is palpable.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It comes across loud and clear in recent videos like “<a href="https://youtu.be/0bLKyp3FYU4">Transat, As Seen By Its Employees</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2eFWcwbzg">Air Transat Jerusalema Challenge</a>.” From maintenance staff to in-flight crew members, many of Transat’s dedicated employees have been at the company for years. They are attracted not just by benefits, such as discounts on resort stays and airline tickets to anywhere the company operates in the world, but also by a nurturing and caring atmosphere going back to the days when founder Jean-Marc Eustache would walk the floors talking to employees.</p>
  <p>As a leading leisure travel company that offers vacation packages and flights to destinations of choice in the Americas and Europe, Transat has a firm commitment to sustainable tourism development. In 2018, it became the first major international tourism company to be Travelife certified for all its tour operating activities. This recognition highlights Transat’s ongoing efforts over the past 15 years to support communities, reduce its environmental impact, raise awareness of sustainability among its partners and customers, and last but not least, involve its employees.</p>
  <p>And the reason is simple. Transat knows a company committed to ensuring the well-being of others must first guarantee that of its employees. That’s why it counts “workplace” as one of its four pillars of action and strives to implement programs that build employee engagement, support its people, and help advance their careers.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="hr-transformation-beginning-with-learning-and-performance-management">HR Transformation Beginning with Learning and Performance Management</h2>
  <p>To build this engagement and allow its people to perform at their best, a company of Transat’s size needs intuitive and efficient human capital management (HCM) systems. Transat’s learning and performance management systems were anything but, tying teams up with tedious, spreadsheet-based processes.</p>
  <p>The tourism company was already using SAP software for core human resource (HR), payroll, and time sheets, so it opted to implement the SAP SuccessFactors Learning and SAP SuccessFactors Performance &#x26; Goals solutions, part of SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite. It worked closely with SAP Preferred Success services not just to get the most from the solutions’ functionality, but also to train system administrators, prepare for new releases, and provide IT support.</p>
  <p>With SAP SuccessFactors Learning, Transat now onboards and trains new employees through class-based training created for specific groups such as call center agents. It can track training more easily, acquire extra modules on soft or technical skills as needed, and customize the software intuitively — for example, to offer training on a specific travel destination.</p>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors Learning even proved useful during Transat’s Recognition Week. Top management are very involved in this fun annual event to thank employees, with the president and vice president even serving employees at a lunch during the week. People were able to use SAP SuccessFactors Learning to book activities from nutrition classes and cooking demos to comedy sessions, showing how the solution is a vital tool for increasing engagement.</p>
  <p>And when the <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic arrived, Transat was able to use SAP SuccessFactors Learning to speedily roll out a range of programs to help employees deal with working remotely while balancing family responsibilities and dealing with a high level of uncertainty.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite helps Transat’s people grow not just skills but also their careers. SAP SuccessFactors Performance &#x26; Goals underlies a process of continuous improvement in which managers and employees can hold discussions to review objectives, achievements, difficulties, priorities, and needs — for example, tools or training — as well as overall employee well-being. At the end of the year, Transat then calibrates its performance evaluations to make sure they are consistent across the business before translating them into pay increases.</p>
  <p>This supports high employee satisfaction and engagement because individuals can see a clear link between performance and salary raises thanks to a transparent evaluation process. And the tools available in SAP SuccessFactors solutions make life easier for both HR partners and top management, with decisions made during the meeting and entered in the system in real time.</p>
  <p>With new CEO Annick Guérard at the helm, Transat is setting a course for the company’s post-pandemic reinvention. This includes refocusing the tour operator as a leisure airline.</p>
  <p>With SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite at their side, Transat’s employees are well equipped to help reinvent the company and to rise to whatever challenges and opportunities come next.</p>

  <h2 id="its-time-to-invest-in-the-power-of-the-cloud">4. It’s Time to Invest in the Power of the Cloud</h2>
  <p>Ideal for today’s hybrid workplace, cloud-based HR solutions enable employees to access HR tools anytime and anywhere. Imran Sajid, senior director of Solution Marketing for SAP, <a href="https://reg.sapevents.sap.com/flow/sap/sapphirenow2021/portal/page/sessions/session/1616531658167001lmzt">explained why</a> yesterday’s solutions are no longer cutting it for today’s workforce. The <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-future-of-work/">future of work</a> is here, and it’s time to provide our workforce with the resources needed to thrive.</p>
  <h2 id="decide-what-type-of-company-you-want-to-be-and-lead-with-that">5. Decide What Type of Company You Want to Be and Lead with That</h2>
  <p>Josh Greenbaum, principal analyst for Enterprise Applications Consulting, has seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of technology transformation. <a href="https://reg.sapevents.sap.com/flow/sap/sapphirenow2021/portal/page/sessions/session/1616720587984001u5HX">His advice</a> to those unsure of which avenue to pursue? Invest in technology transformation that aligns with your company’s values. Modern tools for HR and other business areas can help emulate your vision of what type of company you want to be. For example, <a href="https://reg.sapevents.sap.com/flow/sap/sapphirenow2021/portal/page/sessions/session/1624909779682001cFw5">Erste Group Bank</a> found success in providing a more engaging people experience through implementing a more user-friendly, unified HR process.</p>

      <div>With the need for greater collaboration in virtual environments, <a href="/2021/01/expanding-microsoft-sap-partnership">SAP recently introduced</a> several new integrations between Microsoft Teams and SAP solutions, including SAP SuccessFactors Learning. I spoke to SAP SuccessFactors President Jill Popelka to learn more about these integrations and hear her thoughts on why learning is becoming even more important and how SAP is innovating in this area.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Q: It goes without saying that the way we work has changed drastically over the last year. How has this impacted learning?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Learning has never been more important. While learning has traditionally been essential for standard compliance and basic role training, it plays an increasingly critical role in helping companies drive the people and culture transformation required to adopt new business models and deliver new innovations. In fact, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends.html">45 percent of executives</a> believe that building an organizational culture that celebrates growth, adaptability, and resilience is the most important action they can take to transform work.</p>
  <p>As companies continue to face unanticipated change and disruption, employees are being asked to take on additional tasks, expand responsibilities, and even work on new teams. Organizations need to support their people every step of the way, which includes delivering personalized, relevant learning opportunities that will empower them to be successful.</p>
  <p><strong>The ways in which people learn and how they consume information are also evolving. How is SAP adapting its learning solutions to keep pace with meeting the needs of the learner and the organization?</strong></p>
  <p>As the world of work changes so must our approach to educating and reskilling the workforce. In 2019, SAP identified <a href="/2020/10/experience-wins-hxm-market">human experience management</a> – or HXM – as the next market category for human resources (HR) technology. We recognized the need to evolve our solutions from focusing on just HR processes to delivering engaging, individualized employee experiences. Work may look different today, but intuitive, personalized experiences and technology that prioritizes human connection remain vital to success.</p>
  <p>When it comes to learning, we continue to make several updates to our solutions with HXM in mind. We introduced a <a href="/2020/10/advancing-hxm-innovations-sap-successfactors">redesigned experience</a> for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/corporate-lms.html">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a> in late 2020 to help boost engagement, deliver a more intuitive experience on web and mobile, and surface recommended learning courses. We recently launched an in-product course authoring tool within <a href="https://www.litmos.com/blog/articles/november-release-2011">SAP Litmos</a> to help organizations easily develop engaging courses and deliver the best possible learning experience. And finally, we launched <a href="/2020/10/sap-work-zone-hr-new-digital-workplace">SAP Work Zone for HR</a> to help include guided learning experiences to support employees during critical work and life events.</p>
  <p>With digital and virtual learning on the rise, it’s become more important to foster an environment where people can collaborate and share knowledge to build up skills quickly. We are enabling learners to easily find and consume learning content on any device, at any time by advancing our own solutions and tapping into our robust partner ecosystem. Placing learning in the immediate context of employees’ day-to-day activities can help create stronger collaboration and increase workplace productivity.</p>

  <p><strong>Speaking of your partner ecosystem, SAP and Microsoft recently expanded their partnership with new learning integrations. Can you tell us more about these innovations and what SAP customers can expect?</strong></p>
  <p>Many of our customers rely on Microsoft solutions to support collaboration across the business, and we want to seamlessly offer SAP solutions where we know employees can most naturally and seamlessly access them. <a href="https://word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/aka.ms/vivalearningblog">Two new integrations</a> bring together SAP SuccessFactors Learning and Microsoft technologies, furthering our vision to make learning accessible when, where, and how individuals prefer.</p>
  <p>The first integration will make the course catalog within SAP SuccessFactors Learning accessible in Microsoft Viva. Learners can search for a course without having to switch applications and choose to either open it, share it, pin it to a channel, or add it to their own personal learning page in Microsoft Teams where they can access it at a later time. The second integration will help our customers foster learning communities, collaboration, and social learning by connecting SAP SuccessFactors Learning with Microsoft Teams. Learners can interact with other course participants or the instructor before, during, and after the course within Microsoft Teams, as well as access the activity feed on SAP SuccessFactors Learning.</p>
  <p><strong>What are you hearing from your customers about their current challenges with learning? How is SAP addressing these challenges?</strong></p>
  <p>We continue to speak with our customers about the importance of learning to the success of their people and their organizations. As business continues to grow and change, the number of platforms and sheer volume of content can become quite complex. Employees can become overwhelmed with the number of tools for learning and how they link back to their development or broader business goals. At the same time, organizations struggle to understand how learning is being consumed and applied.</p>
  <p>At SAP, our vision is to deliver unified access to all kinds of learning experiences – content-focused, experiential, and even from different vendors. Employees need to be able to access learning quickly and easily, effectively collaborate and connect with others, and share knowledge – anytime, anywhere, and across all different systems of work. Achieving this requires a personalized learning path with context-based recommendations that make it easy for employees to find relevant content and understand how their learning and skills contribute to the broader organization. We are reimagining learning so organizations can be more agile in the face of change, more resilient to ever-changing market dynamics, and more effective in driving employee and organizational transformation.</p>
