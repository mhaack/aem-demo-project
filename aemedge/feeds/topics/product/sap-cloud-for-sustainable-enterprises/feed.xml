    <div>
      <div>Amid challenging times, sustainability remains a critical priority worldwide—and music remains an outlet for community and shared experiences. This year, Coldplay is uniting with SAP for a carbon-offsetting <em>Music Of The Spheres World Tour.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>When the date of the concert you’ve been waiting all year for rolls around, you’ll probably consider how you’ll get to the show. The answer to this simple question can have a big impact on your night, but it could have an even bigger impact on your carbon footprint, which effects your community and our planet.</p>
  <p>Believe it or not, audience travel to and from a concert is a major contributor to any tour’s carbon emissions. Many fans are unaware of this, but with the right motivation, we can empower millions.</p>
  <p><strong>Coldplay</strong>, one of the most celebrated and purpose-driven acts in music today, had a mission for their upcoming world tour: to make it their most sustainable and environmentally friendly yet. They were looking to reduce consumption, increase support in green technology, and work to decrease total CO2 emissions. They also saw an opportunity to connect with their fans.</p>
  <p>Coldplay knew they could offer a concert-going experience like no other while providing fans with a chance to join them in their commitment. But to bring this vision to life, they needed a little help. <strong>Enter SAP</strong>.</p>

  <p>“With our technology and solutions, we empower organizations worldwide to drive sustainable change,” said Christian Klein, CEO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “Coldplay and SAP share a common and profound commitment to sustainability, and we are thrilled to join forces to make their tour as environmentally friendly as possible.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/about/customer-stories/coldplay.html">SAP collaborated with Coldplay</a> to develop and release the <em>Coldplay Music Of The Spheres World Tour</em> app. It combines interactive, immersive experiences along with features to help fans make more environmentally friendly decisions when it comes to travel. Once users download the app, they’ll begin their journey and explore different sections that all have unique ways to become part of the Coldplay universe throughout the tour.</p>
  <p>Fans can start with sustainability in the travel section of the app. Here, they can visualize and better understand how their method of travel contributes to their carbon footprint. By selecting from seven different modes of transportation — car, taxi, train, public transportation, bicycle, on foot, or flight — fans can really see their impact. And to promote more sustainable travel options, the app provides rewards via merchandise discount codes to Coldplay’s online shop for concert goers who commit to low-carbon transportation options.</p>
  <p>Here’s what else is in the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tour:</strong> Check out dates and locations, find tickets, and even share your favorite shows on your personal social media accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Planet:</strong> Immerse yourself in interactive sustainability-themed games while learning more about Coldplay’s efforts and the band’s tour partners.</li>
    <li><strong>Universe:</strong> Create your own Coldplay-themed content using augmented reality. Create videos, take pictures, and even dance with aliens, then share your creations across social media. While you’re here, access exclusive videos, pictures, live concert audio streams, and get updates from the band.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To bring this world-class experience to life, SAP tapped two best-in-class solutions: <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html?campaigncode=CRM-YS22-CDP-CDPLAMP">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-for-sustainable-enterprises.html?campaigncode=CRM-YS22-CDP-CDPLAMP">SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a>. Coldplay is also using SAP Analytics Cloud to gain insights into the carbon footprint caused by fans who travel based on data captured in the app, which will help the band track how the tour is offsetting calculated carbon emissions.</p>
  <p>“For the past few years, we’ve been figuring out how to put sustainability at the heart of our tour and the app plays a big role in bringing that vision and commitment to life. We’re really proud of the collaboration with our partner SAP, who has created an impactful, engaging app that helps our fans choose more sustainable ways to travel to our shows,” said Coldplay.</p>
  <p>The challenges that Coldplay faces with managing carbon emissions from audience travel to shows is not unique to the music industry. Businesses everywhere are struggling with managing carbon emissions that are not a part of their company’s operations or under their direct control — otherwise known as Scope 3 emissions. SAP helps businesses across the world become intelligent sustainable enterprises by providing digital solutions and capabilities to holistically manage sustainability performance across all touch points of their business.</p>
  <p>Sustainability needs harmony. Only together, through commitment and scale, can we begin improving our environmental impact. With the <em>Music Of The Spheres World Tour</em> app, we’re excited to show the world that when we work as one, we can drive awareness, action, and — most importantly — change.</p>
  <p><strong>To experience it all for yourself, the <em>Coldplay Music Of The Spheres World Tour</em> app is available for download right now on</strong> <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1603820130">iOS</a></strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sap.coldplay">Android</a></strong>.</p>

        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF and AMSTERDAM</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) and the management and technology consultancy BearingPoint today announced they will join forces on carbon and environmental footprint solutions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The companies will collaborate to advance the design and development of a leading-edge solution for customers to help them reach zero emissions.</p>
  <p>Measuring, managing and steering carbon footprints is a key element of reaching zero emissions and part of the climate action program promoted by SAP. Companies are under increasing pressure to determine their carbon footprint not only on a corporate level but also on a product level. However, the data acquisition, consolidation and mapping are challenges that many companies face. Together with the recent launch of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-for-sustainable-enterprises.html">SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a> solution, SAP solutions for sustainability and BearingPoint’s long-standing experience with emission calculations in the market, the companies are well equipped to develop innovative solutions to address customer concerns about environmental footprinting across their value chain.</p>
  <p>“The co-development partnership between SAP and BearingPoint will bring together two strong value propositions. BearingPoint has long experience helping customers identify carbon reduction potentials and achieve sustainability targets. SAP contributes innovation capabilities, broad system landscape and reach to customers. Together as partners we will push the limits to move the economy forward on the path to zero emissions,” said Gunther Rothermel, SVP, Head of SAP S/4HANA Sustainability, SAP.</p>

  <h2 id="carbon-footprinting-for-the-entire-value-chain-scope-1-2-and-3">Carbon Footprinting for the Entire Value Chain: Scope 1, 2 and 3</h2>
  <p>While many companies have already assessed their scope 1, and scope 2 emissions, assessing the entire value chain by introducing scope 3 emissions is key. To do so environmental networks must support data exchange with partners like suppliers, clients, auditors and governments even if they use different IT systems. Building on BearingPoint’s in-depth know-how in product and corporate footprint calculations and algorithms, the SAP Product Footprint Management solution supports data gathering and calculations to help realize end-to-end carbon and environmental footprinting. The SAP solution is fully integrated with SAP S/4HANA and the intelligent enterprise architecture, but also connects with other data sources. This enables it to perform automated assessments of footprints across the value chain, even in heterogenous system landscapes.</p>
  <p>“Together with SAP, we will co-develop utilizing our IP asset and provide a unique solution in the market to measure and optimize the climate impact of products across the entire lifecycle. SAP Product Footprint Management has sophisticated capabilities to determine the carbon footprint of a single product. Our 10-years-plus proven industry experience in calculating and optimizing product and corporate CO2 footprints will enable our joint customers to meet their decarbonization targets. We at BearingPoint believe that together with SAP’s innovative solutions, depth in commercial processes and market expertise we can make a positive impact on the climate,” said Donald Wachs, Head of IP Assets, BearingPoint, and Member of the BearingPoint Management Committee.</p>
  <p>“The partnership with BearingPoint accelerates the SAP Product Footprint Management solution road map and will help make us a market leader in product footprint solutions that support our customers in maximizing the sustainability of their products and services,” said Peter Maier, President, Industries and Customer Advisory, SAP.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Gone are the days when companies discussed the <strong>why</strong> of sustainable business practices. Today, it is all about the <strong>how</strong>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>How can businesses take climate action? How can they turn linear processes into circular resources and product flows? How can they ensure socially responsible value chains? And ultimately, how can they integrate economic, environmental, and social performance into strategic decision-making?</p>
  <p>These questions are top of mind for executives. In 2021, sustainability <a href="https://go.alpha-sense.com/wp-sap-sustainability/">became the top trending topic for the C-suite</a>.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we deliver answers to these questions through our products. Our customers can benefit from solutions that help them achieve <strong>zero emissions</strong>, <strong>zero waste</strong>, <strong>zero inequality</strong>, as well as <strong>holistic steering and reporting</strong> of their sustainability efforts.</p>
  <p>Last year, we launched three new solutions: <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/product-footprint-management.html">SAP Product Footprint Management</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability-control-tower.html">SAP Sustainability Control Tower</a>. All are embedded SAP S/4HANA cloud-native applications that are delivered in a modular way and built on top of SAP Business Technology Platform.</p>
  <p>What is more, we are embedding sustainability across SAP’s entire solution portfolio. A recent example is the inclusion of product footprints in SAP Integrated Business Planning, so customers can monitor the greenhouse gas emissions from their production plants. Another example is the integration of SAP Sustainability Control Tower with SAP SuccessFactors solutions, enabling customers to obtain insights into how their organization is faring on crucial aspects such as diversity and inclusion.</p>

  <h2 id="sustainable-business-strategies-sustainable-enterprises">Sustainable Business Strategies, Sustainable Enterprises</h2>
  <p>For the last 50 years, our innovative solutions have helped our customers transform their business processes and stay ahead in rapidly changing business environments. And we will continue to take and enable organizations of any size and in any industry to take a transformative approach to sustainability as well.</p>
  <p>Quick fixes that do not get to the root cause of problems won’t make businesses more sustainable in the long run. Fragmented sustainability strategies won’t help. Sustainable business strategies will. That is why we support companies in integrating sustainability into the heart of their business processes.</p>
  <p>Our approach pays off. Today, the most sustainable companies run our software. According to our analysis of S&#x26;P Trucost Limited data and <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/esg/solutions/data-intelligence-esg-scores">S&#x26;P Global ESG Scores for 2021</a>, SAP customers with high digital maturity — those adopting SAP’s latest technologies — on average have 75% better environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores compared to their industry peers. They also produce 24% less CO2 emissions than the market average.</p>
  <p>To further facilitate the sustainability transformation for our customers, we recently launched a new offering. <a href="/2022/01/sap-cloud-for-sustainable-enterprises-take-action-together">SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a> is a flexible bundle of sustainability-specific applications. It allows businesses to adopt our solutions based on the current stage of their sustainability transformation. Depending on where they stand, they can implement holistic management or start with specific areas of sustainability performance.</p>

  <p>The past year has been all about delivering the tools that help businesses transition into sustainable enterprises. So, what’s next? 2022 will be the year to implement these tools <a href="/2022/01/global-sustainability-ecosystem-power-scale">globally in close collaboration with our customers and partners</a>.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the transition to a more sustainable global economy is not something one company can achieve on its own. In today’s interconnected world, we must rely on our ecosystem to ensure sustainability across the entire value chain. Let’s make 2022 the year we transition toward a more sustainable world, together.</p>

      <div><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong> — The <a href="https://cdn.nrf.com/sites/default/files/2020-06/RS-118304%20NRF%20Retail%20Impact%20Report%20.pdf">retail industry’s</a> $3.9 trillion contribution to the U.S. annual GDP makes it the nation’s leading industry for private sector employment and uniquely positioned to address climate change.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As recently as the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) meetings, the <a href="https://nrf.com/blog/retailers-set-science-based-targets-address-climate-change">National Retail Federation (NRF)</a> stated, “Retailers will continue inventing and implementing pragmatic climate change solutions because the needs identified at COP26 demand nothing less.”</p>
  <p>To help retailers digitally transform to make their businesses sustainable, SAP is featuring a number of offerings, including these:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The new <a href="/2021/07/sap-intelligent-returns-management-consumers-retailers-environment">SAP Intelligent Returns Management solution</a> was built to optimize the returns process for the retail industry.

    <li>The recently updated <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2021/09/a6120d2d-f87d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP Assortment Planning application</a> now offers advanced category management capabilities. It uses customer data science, assortment strategies, business rules and AI to plan space-aware, localized assortments with a user experience designed for the needs of today’s category manager. Customer-centric, relevant assortments increase customer loyalty, boost profitability and support a more sustainable supply chain.</li>

      </ul>

  <p>SAP’s solutions enable retailers to integrate sustainable business practices smoothly, which is critical to a fast-paced industry such as retail. According to Leslie Hand, IDC Group Vice President, IDC Retail Insights, <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fidc_emea%2F&#x26;data=04%7C01%7Cstacy.comes%40sap.com%7C32f20fbd808e403ebab108d9c18832a2%7C42f7676cf455423c82f6dc2d99791af7%7C0%7C0%7C637753612987837002%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&#x26;sdata=Avs0Ujbs1kRZqn0deU53aOOosGrbGrMddrMgbScdhSc%3D&#x26;reserved=0">IDC’s latest research</a> indicates that retail organizations report that, relative to political, social and economic risks, changing environmental targets and regulations will have the greatest impact on their digital transformation and tech investment plans in the next two years. Further, 80% (Asia Pacific) 59% (United States) and 64% (EMEA) of retail organizations agree that their digital technology strategy is an important enabler of their organization’s broader sustainability efforts.*</p>

      <div>Sustainability is a team sport. No company or organization can do it alone. A vibrant ecosystem is the best approach to enable us all to achieve our sustainability goals.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That is why we’re working with technology companies, leading non-governmental organizations (NGOs), management consulting firms, global systems integrators, sustainability ratings platforms, and standards-setting organizations to understand sustainability business needs and build solutions to support them.</p>
  <p>Through these efforts, SAP is proud to enable many <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability/customer-stories.html">visionary customers</a>, including: <strong>Unilever,</strong> which is innovating the global food system; <strong>Hitachi,</strong> which is scaling the power of renewable energy; <strong>Colgate,</strong> which is investing to reduce waste; and <strong>Anglian Water,</strong> which is rapidly implementing a holistic sustainable business strategy.</p>

  <p>Beyond supporting our customers, we are strengthening our own sustainability commitments. We’ve announced that we will accelerate our goal to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2030, rather than 2050 — achieving our net-zero target 20 years earlier than we originally planned. Our chief sustainability officer <a href="/">explains how we’ve been able to make this commitment</a>. We are also proud to be recognized on the <a href="/2021/12/sap-achieves-top-scores-dow-jones-sustainability-index-and-cdp-carbon-disclosure-project">prestigious CDP A list</a>, which names a select group of companies leading the way to a more sustainable future, and to have earned the top ranking in the S&#x26;P Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) in the software sector for the 15th consecutive year.</p>
  <p>There is no question that accelerated business action toward sustainability will have a dramatic positive impact on people and the planet. At SAP, we believe it is also the greatest economic opportunity of our time. Viewing sustainability as an added cost to business is incorrect; it is a competitive advantage.</p>
  <p>We also understand that business must be both profitable and sustainable. This means putting people, the planet, and profit on equal footing — making the “green line” as important as the top line and the bottom line. Companies that focus on sustainable business performance will gain competitive efficiencies, more easily comply with increasing regulation, and ultimately be able to adapt and thrive through new business opportunities.</p>

    </div>

  <p>We have learned a great deal through years of focus, investment, and experience working with customers and managing our own sustainability efforts. Urgent action is needed in 2022 and the calls of a “<a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362">code red for humanity</a>” are not overstated. It’s time for every business to act.</p>
  <p>Since there is no such thing as sustainability in a silo, we’re sharing what we have learned. This week we’re releasing a guide outlining Five Actions for Sustainable Business.</p>
  <p>The five actions apply to companies of all sizes, industries, geographies, and stages of becoming a sustainable business. This guide is intended to bind strategy to execution, offering a clear road map to a more sustainable future. If every company took these five actions, we would take major steps forward to enable businesses, industries, and economies to deliver the positive outcomes we urgently need.</p>
  <p><strong>1. Establish a Sustainable Business Strategy</strong> Ensure sustainability is central to your overall business strategy with all corporate functions contributing. Measure your progress and report your annual sustainability outcomes at the same level of importance as your financials.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Embed Sustainable Business Data into Processes and Networks</strong> Use sustainability data within your business processes to make sustainable and profitable decisions and measure performance. Then share the sustainability performance data — which could include calculated carbon emissions, water use, recyclability, or labor information — with your suppliers, industry associations, regulators, and NGOs.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Manage Carbon and Climate Exposure Throughout the Business</strong> Reduce your financial and reputational risks by accounting for and managing climate-related emissions across all parts of your value chain, down to the individual product and service level.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Embrace Circularity and Become Regenerative</strong> Use operating principles to avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle, and reclaim materials to minimize waste and accelerate your adoption of circular economy processes. Go beyond doing “less bad” to adopt approaches to do “more good.”</p>
  <p><strong>5. Prioritize People Across Your Value Chain</strong> Enhance your social sustainability by respecting your workforce diversity, safety, and human rights, developing learning and growth opportunities, and leveraging the power of your corporate purchasing.</p>
  <p>It is important to note the key element that powers all five of these steps: data. The saying “you can’t manage what you can’t measure” applies to revenue, profits, and sustainability. Yet our <a href="https://insights.sap.com/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness/">SAP Insights research</a> shows that 79% of companies report being dissatisfied with the quality of the data they collect about environmental sustainability. The World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/no-1-esg-challenge-data-environmental-social-governance-reporting/">reports just nine percent of companies actively use software</a> that supports data collection, analysis, and reporting on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) actions.</p>
  <p>To facilitate better use of data, today SAP is announcing a new cloud offering to power any organization’s sustainability goals.</p>
  <h2 id="introducing-sap-cloud-for-sustainable-enterprises">Introducing SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</h2>
  <p>For 50 years, companies have turned to SAP to measure, manage, and optimize their top- and bottom-line business outcomes. Today, we are adding the ability to measure sustainability outcomes and bring clarity to their green line.</p>
  <p>To manage the green line, companies need business process technology to identify, quantify, analyze, and act on data through their end-to-end operations. To enable this, our new offering, <strong><a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability.html#cloud-for-sustainable-enterprises">SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a></strong>, brings together a comprehensive portfolio of solutions that enables businesses to holistically manage sustainability performance.</p>
  <p>While the solution is comprehensive, the approach is simple: one customizable cloud offering, one license, with expert <a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/dg/accelerate-sustainable-impact/index.html?source=social-global-voicestorm-None&#x26;campaigncode=CRM-YD21-SOC-GETSOC1">implementation support from SAP</a> and our highly <a href="/">skilled partner ecosystem</a>.</p>
  <p>Whether you want to deliver on your net-zero sustainability goal, achieve compliance with sustainability regulations, reclaim waste materials, or empower a more diverse workforce, SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises provides the technology solution to power your outcomes.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>SAP has committed to achieve net-zero along our value chain in line with a 1.5°C future in 2030 – 20 years earlier than originally targeted.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Is this too bold? I don’t think so. The recent COP26 climate conference and the Glasgow Climate Pact gave a strong signal to countries and businesses to set more ambitious targets in order to prevent further irreversible damage from climate change. Given the climate and social crisis the world faces, we need to “go big” with our ambitions and have the courage to act, thereby living up to SAP’s purpose to help the world run better and improve people’s lives.</p>
  <p>More than a decade ago, SAP set out on its sustainability journey with the objective to create positive economic, environmental, and social impact within planetary boundaries. Along the way, we have <a href="/2021/07/cfo-sustainability-reporting-esg-metrics-enterprise-software">experienced the benefits as well as the challenges</a> of integrating economic, social, and environmental performance into how we measure and steer our business success holistically. Setting and monitoring ambitious and measurable targets while leveraging digital solutions have proven crucial to decarbonization.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Raising our ambition to get to net-zero is therefore one of the key cornerstones on our path forward to implementing our holistic approach to sustainability, which looks across climate action, the circular economy, social responsibility, holistic steering and reporting, and the many areas of interconnection.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/">2021 Sixth Assessment</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">SAP’s intense engagement on the ground at COP26</a> have left us with a deepened understanding of the science, the role of business, and the impact of SAP. With an increased sense of urgency, we recognize the responsibility, as well as the opportunity, to step up and drive a faster transformation toward a sustainable future.</p>
  <p>Leveraging SAP’s global reach, today we <a href="/">announced the release of SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a> to help companies quickly adopt holistic sustainability management capabilities. In addition, we commit to accelerate SAP’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/purpose-and-sustainability/economics/net-zero-commitment.html">timeline to net-zero</a> from 2050 to 2030 and to reach our climate goals, in line with the Paris Agreement, 20 years earlier.</p>
  <h2 id="what-does-net-zero-mean">What Does Net-Zero Mean?</h2>
  <p>Net-zero is a state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere. It has gained significant traction, with net-zero pledges covering 16% of the global economy in 2019 and recently growing to nearly 80% committed to net-zero by 2050. Because the various definitions of net-zero and how to get there have been growing too, so have criticism and skepticism.</p>
  <p>Leading up to COP26, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-launches-world-first-net-zero-corporate-standard">launched its Net-Zero Standard</a> to provide a credible and independent assessment of corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science, which enables companies to align their near- and long-term climate action with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.</p>
  <p>­­­Building on its <a href="/2021/10/integrating-climate-action-end-to-end">carbon reduction journey since 2009</a>, SAP became a member of SBTi and, in 2017, was the first German company with a science-based carbon reduction target for 2050. In 2019, SAP raised its commitment and adopted a <a href="/2019/07/sap-emissions-reduction-targets">1.5°C science-based emissions reduction target</a>.</p>
  <p>On our pathway toward net-zero, the next intermediate milestone is 2023, when <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">SAP aims to be carbon neutral in its own operations</a> – two years earlier than originally targeted. This includes all direct (Scope 1), indirect (Scope 2), and selected categories of value chain (Scope 3) carbon emissions, such as business flights, employee commuting, and external data centers (co-locations and hyperscalers).</p>
  <p>The potential for decarbonization can be amplified considerably if we enhance our efforts along the entire value chain. In 2020, carbon emissions amounted to 12,300 kt along SAP’s entire value chain (including upstream and downstream emissions) compared to 135 kt net emissions for SAP’s own operations.</p>
  <h2 id="targeting-our-entire-value-chain">Targeting Our Entire Value Chain</h2>
  <p>Reducing emissions from the use of SAP’s sold products will be the primary lever, followed by purchased goods and services. Our focus will be on the following key areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accelerating the transformation of on-premise customers to cloud</li>
    <li>Strengthening engagement with key suppliers to commit to net-zero and deliver products and services on a carbon-neutral basis</li>
    <li>Using best-in-class data centers (our own, our co-locations, and hyperscalers) with sustainable programming and a cloud carbon footprint calculator for all SAP cloud solutions</li>
    <li>Enhancing direct investments in renewable electricity as well as nature-based and technical-based funds to neutralize residual carbon emissions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The next step is to receive external validation by SBTi. We have started setting up a cross-company program involving experts from different lines of business to prepare for our net-zero transformation and will continue to make progress transparent, for example in our annual <a href="http://www.sapintegratedreport.com">Integrated Report</a>.</p>
  <p>We are not starting from scratch. We have many achievements to build on, but we are also charting new territory. 2030 is just nine years away. The challenge will increase the more we move upstream and downstream into our value chain. We will face both synergies as well as additional complexity as we interface with our further focus areas for sustainability, including holistic steering and reporting, circular economy, and social responsibility based on respect for human rights.<br>But as our external sustainability advisory panel confirmed for us, this is the right thing to do. Our net-zero commitment is one of many actions we are taking at SAP. It will take all of us to work together to deliver the outcomes we need for people and planet, and for a profitable, sustainable business.</p>
  <p>As Luka Mucic, CFO, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, and Board sponsor for sustainability at SAP, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRA6IbREmvw">noted at the end of the Sustainable Innovation Forum</a> at COP26: “We must reinvent the global economy. That is what it will take to limit global warming to 1.5℃. All of us must build sustainability into the fabric of how we do business. Only when a business strategy is sustainable itself, and is embedded in all aspects of the business, can we reduce negative impacts and create regenerative systems.”</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>According to a recent <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/10/92351eae-017e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP and Alpha Sense survey</a>, most businesses have not embedded sustainability into their core strategies. In some cases, corporations see sustainability management as a regulatory and compliance challenge rather than a strategic opportunity for economic and social growth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Therefore, businesses run different technologies and end up operating in silos, which prevent them from connecting financial outcomes with non-financial metrics. Additionally, companies can view sustainability as an after-the-fact reporting activity without any influence in its executive decisions.</p>
  <p>Today, more than ever, businesses need to holistically manage their business models across their supply chains, operations, and people agenda.</p>
  <p>At the recent COP26 climate conference, <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">business and government leaders agreed on the urgency</a> to reinvent their business models to accelerate sustainable business performance. Business leaders want to meet regulatory requirements, improve efficiency in their processes, and create responsible products and services.</p>
  <p>As the leading enterprise resource management company, SAP has committed to help customers in their digital transformation to make sustainability profitable and profitability sustainable.</p>
  <p>In this digital transformation, SAP’s approach is based on providing visibility and transparency to make sustainable decisions from the CEO’s office to the end user, connecting business processes to embed sustainability into all business functions — from carbon accounting to gender equality — and providing a global ecosystem of partners than can help SAP to scale impact through businesses of all sizes and across all industries around the world.</p>
  <p>Providing a global ecosystem to help businesses is core to SAP’s DNA.</p>
  <p>Julia White, chief marketing and solutions officer and member of the Executive Board at SAP SE, points out: “<a href="/">Sustainability is a team sport</a>. No company or organization can do it alone. We work with many of the world’s best companies who support our vision and work together with us every day to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers.”</p>
  <p>Working with SAP, <a href="https://www.sap.com/partner.html">partners</a> advance market development for sustainable solutions. They turn ideas and imperatives into compelling paths to action that leverage SAP solutions. Together, we advocate with thought leadership and galvanize collective efforts and methodologies in industry forums like the World Economic Forum, World Business Council on Sustainable Development, and United Nations Organizations.</p>
  <p>SAP and its ecosystem accelerate sustainable innovation as a central element of the intelligent enterprise. Through co-innovation as well as solution and content partnerships, SAP brings more complete solutions to market faster, benefiting our customers and the planet. More broadly, SAP serves as a key player in a thriving ecosystem of sustainability innovation — helping customers more easily capitalize on emerging solutions that tie closely to their digital core. With its robust network, SAP can deliver a path to sustainability innovation that no other individual competitor can match.</p>
