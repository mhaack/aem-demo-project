        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced it has been positioned as a Leader in “<a href="https://reprints2.forrester.com/#/assets/2/702/RES176577/report">The Forrester Wave™: Master Data Management, Q4 2021</a>.”</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Forrester Research Inc., a leading global research and advisory firm, researched, analyzed and scored 15 vendors and named SAP a Leader. The report analyzed the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/master-data-governance.html">SAP Master Data Governance</a> application and noted its “good multidomain MDM capabilities at scale” as well as its “prebuilt data models, business rules, workflows, and user interfaces to support MDM deployments.” The 24 scoring criteria employed by Forrester Research covered three categories: Current Offering, Strategy and Market Presence.</p>
  <p>The report states that SAP “supports a multidomain MDM solution for on-premises, private, and public cloud deployment with quality, stewardship, and governance capabilities” and “focuses on extending the cloud services, increasing automation and intelligence, and delivering more integrated data management solutions.”</p>
  <p>The Forrester report points out that “reference customers mainly had positive feedback on SAP [Master Data Governance],” with one customer pointing out, “SAP [Master Data Governance] implementation brought us greater government control and streamlined efficiency.”</p>
  <p>“In our digital economy, having correct, comprehensive and timely views of data is paramount to success,” said Dr. Andreas Doehrn, head of Master Data Management Engineering, SAP. “SAP Master Data Governance improves the quality and consistency of information by consolidating and centrally governing the master data lifecycle. We believe Forrester’s recognition of SAP as a Leader in this evaluation is testament to our robust data solutions and the benefit we bring to our customers.”</p>
  <p>As part of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, SAP Master Data Governance allows businesses to create a single source of truth by uniting SAP and third-party data sources and mass processing additional bulk updates on large volumes of data. Customers can establish a cohesive and harmonized master data management strategy across domains to simplify enterprise data management, increase data accuracy and reduce total cost of ownership.</p>

      <div>For companies that strive to become integrated, intelligent enterprises, it has never been more important to have access to trusted, high-quality master data—whether it be to optimize operations, to better understand and service customers, or to speed up innovations to the market.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Companies are increasingly looking for modular applications that can be composed into integrated business processes across many applications. And, of course, there is also the trend to increasingly consume these applications in the cloud. To support these new realities, master data management (MDM) also needs to follow these trends. As a result, we are evolving SAP Master Data Governance in this direction.</p>
  <p>We are happy to provide a new version: the cloud edition of the <a href="http://www.sap.com/mdg">SAP Master Data Governance</a> application. And today, we have <a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/td/sap-mdg-cloud-trial.html">launched a free trial to give you a sneak peek</a>.</p>

    </picture>We expect that many companies will use the cloud edition in addition to—not as a replacement of—SAP Master Data Governance on SAP S/4HANA in order to establish a federated approach to master data governance in their enterprises. Federated data governance is a new MDM paradigm and adaptive model that allows the enterprise to manage data exactly where it’s best understood to optimize MDM scope, benefits, and effort.
  </p>
  <p>We are convinced that, for many companies, this new modular approach will provide faster time to value, better total cost of ownership, and a broader reach of enterprise-wide master data management initiatives.</p>

  <p>Today, SAP Master Data Governance is typically used to centrally manage master data of a complete enterprise with just one single SAP Master Data Governance on SAP S/4HANA. The new federated deployment option for SAP Master Data Governance works to provide an approach to extend the value proposition in areas of your company that may have been difficult to include in your program.</p>
  <p>SAP Master Data Governance, cloud edition, will help provide a non-disruptive path toward more agile and flexible master data governance that will fully leverage all investments that you have already made in SAP Master Data Governance on SAP S/4HANA. And for companies that have not yet started their MDM journey, it will work to provide a quick start through an easy to consume software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution.</p>
