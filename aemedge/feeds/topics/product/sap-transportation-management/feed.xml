  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>For the 10th consecutive year, SAP has been named as a Leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Transportation Management Systems.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP is positioned in the Leaders Quadrant based on our Ability to Execute and for the Completeness of our Vision.</p>
  <p>We believe that this recognition confirms our strategy in Logistics, which is based on three pillars:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Connecting every process and providing synchronized logistics execution to support highly efficient and fast paced fulfillment cycles</li>
    <li>Collaborating with a single network of carriers, digital forwarders, and visibility providers to spot risks and avoid disruptions and thereby provide best-in-class delivery experience</li>
    <li>Contextualizing every decision, leveraging artificial intelligence (<a href="/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>) and machine learning to optimize operations and to provide business insights</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SAP Transportation Management is an integral part of the overall SAP strategy and gives companies the ability to manage their end-to-end transportation processes from procurement through planning and execution to freight settlement with analytics to support each step.</p>
  <p>We continue to innovate in SAP Transportation Management based on our market analysis and even more importantly based on feedback from our global install base and ecosystem. Recent innovations include advancements in areas like sustainability, planning and optimization, supply chain execution, and generative AI.</p>
  <p>SAP Transportation Management and SAP Business Network for Logistics enable logistics partners to collaborate with each other and provide visibility to all stakeholders throughout the shipment lifecycle and help manage risks as they arise through intelligent insights. We continue to grow SAP Business Network, adding more carriers and additional networks to provide expanded coverage around the world and across all transportation modes.</p>
  <p>As more customers evaluate SAP Transportation Management, we continue to strategically expand our partner network to ensure our customers have access to an ecosystem that supports their operations no matter where they are in the world or how they move their freight. Our global partner network made up of systems integrators, business consultants, and technology providers help our customers manage their transportation transformations, whether they be system replacements, upgrades, greenfield deployments, or part of larger enterprise transformations.</p>
  <p>“Our customers use SAP Transportation Management and SAP Business Network for Logistics to manage transportation operations in more than 20 industries and in every corner of the world,” said Till Dengel, global head of Logistics and Manufacturing Product Marketing at SAP. “Because we look at logistics holistically, clients can confidently confirm their orders, knowing that fulfillment can be executed as promised, since ERP, warehousing, and transportation are always in sync.”</p>
  <p>“Adopting logistics solutions from SAP across our facilities in all our markets allowed us to optimize freight transportation,” said Carlo Noè, Global Process and Applications Manager for Trade, Transport, and Logistics Division at Hitachi Energy Ltd. “We can interact with our stakeholders and carriers in a digital way, helping us manage supply chain risk, enhance agility, and build supply chain resilience.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These were the words of Pepijn Timmermans, vice president of Digitalization at VDL Nedcar, who I recently had the chance to speak to about how the company modernized and digitalized its yard operations.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-vdl-nedcar">What Is VDL Nedcar?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.vdlnedcar.nl/en">VDL Nedcar</a> is not just the only independent contract manufacturer in the Netherlands but also one of the most advanced vehicle manufacturers in Europe. The 50-year-old company builds high-quality cars for major brands such as BMW, as well as a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) variant of the MINI Countryman. And as a company that banks on strong partnerships and innovation, VDL will also build electric vehicles for their newest customer, the U.S. company Canoo.</p>
  <h2 id="how-to-manage-a-yard-full-of-moving-products">How to Manage a Yard Full of Moving Products</h2>
  <p>VDL Nedcar faced the challenge of managing the movement of vehicles, parts, and materials. “We have 1,000 parts suppliers, 12,000 parts numbers, and seven carriers who bring all these parts by truck to our plant, which results in an inbound of 270 full trucks per day coming in and going out,” Timmermans explained.</p>
  <p>“The automotive industry has a closed loop where packaging material is brought back to the supplier. This means transport can arrive at any moment and within only one hour the driver drops a trailer, picks up another with packaging materials, and leaves the yard,” he added. “We have to manage 350 trailers in our yard. Basically, it’s a warehouse management system for trailers.”</p>
  <p>The process to do this was very manual. When a carrier came in, they picked an empty spot in the yard, filled out papers, and took them to the office where the information was put into the system. This was a very labor-intensive and error-prone process, and, as Timmermans explained, “If we missed only one trailer, the impact could be dramatic and costly.” A missed trailer of a vital part could harm the production processes and even lead to major stoppages of the plant for a full day, which relies on a just-in-time approach.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The answer was to analyze business processes. “We have a very unique inbound logistics supply chain concept. I think we are the only one of the OEMs in Europe who has control of inbound transport fully in our own hands,” Timmermans said. “In our material requirement system, we also integrate the whole of inbound logistics transport planning as part of the <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-mrp/">material requirement planning</a>, which makes us unique and enables us to have very efficient inbound logistics.”</p>
  <p>“We established a ‘warehouse on wheels’ concept, which optimizes our transport efficiency,” he said. “Instead of booking a time slot days ahead with the risk of long waiting times at the gate and manual management of documents in the past, carriers can arrive at our plant 24/7, sign in at the gate, get a parking location assigned for the trailer, and receive a note where to pick up an empty trailer with packaging materials.”</p>
  <h2 id="managing-the-logistics-of-the-yard">Managing the Logistics of the Yard</h2>
  <p>To get full control and transparency of this warehouse on wheels, VDL Nedcar implemented <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/yard-logistics.html">SAP Yard Logistics</a>.</p>
  <p>“Based on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/yard-logistics.html">SAP Yard Logistics</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/fiori.html">SAP Fiori apps</a>, we developed a solution where our six dock master trucks that drive the trailers from the yard to the loading dock and empty back to the yard can be steered fully automatically,” Timmermans explained. “The trucks are equipped with industrial flat screens and connected to the solution. All movement triggers are visualized for the dock masters and they get automated priorities for which trailer to transport where, including an optimization algorithm to indicate which truck is close to the trailer to be picked up. Getting this process automated and optimized saved one employee per shift.”</p>
  <p>“Previously, we also did a manual weekly inventory of all trailers on the yard for which we needed one man day per week. That has all gone,” he added.</p>
  <p>“SAP Yard Logistics helps us cooperate with our suppliers much better. We have an easier, digitalized, and transparent process at the gate for our carriers, which boosts efficiency, reduces waiting time, and eases administration,” he said.</p>
  <p><strong>Tangible benefits</strong> include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increased process transparency</li>
    <li>Reduced administrative effort of one day per week</li>
    <li>Time savings thanks to inventory automation</li>
    <li>Efficiency gains due to automated and digitalized processes on the yard saving one employee per shift</li>
    <li>Reduced waiting time for carriers and enabling them to plan better</li>
    <li>Streamlined and transparent processes at the gate</li>
    <li>Almost no incidents or administrative mistakes</li>
    <li>Standard solution that is integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>“In the future, we plan to connect our yard logistics processes with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/transportation-logistics.html">SAP Transportation Management</a> to provide a self-service portal for the carriers, automate gate processes with cameras, and leverage <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/extended-warehouse-management.html">SAP Extended Warehouse Management</a> to get full transparency across the entire supply chain,” Timmermans concluded.</p>
