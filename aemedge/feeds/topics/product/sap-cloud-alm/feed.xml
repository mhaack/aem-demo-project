      <div>Large enterprises are increasingly moving their IT operations and applications into the cloud to be more agile and so they can more readily scale their businesses. Businesses need tools to successfully manage their business processes within cloud environments as well as the process for building, deploying, and testing applications.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That’s why SAP Cloud ALM enables easier and faster deployment of cloud solutions from SAP. In short, it is an integration engine for business transformation and is included in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> and SAP support offerings. It is an entirely new solution built using cloud-native principles.</p>
  <p>SAP Cloud ALM can provide customers with a harmonized implementation experience across all components of the Intelligent Enterprise, mainly cloud-centric but also for hybrid environments. Spanning the entire application life cycle, SAP Cloud ALM supports designing, building, testing, and deploying solutions. SAP Cloud ALM provides one methodology and tool chain, one process hierarchy, best practices, end-to-end traceability, and proactive support.</p>
  <p>SAP Cloud ALM is integrated with the applications to support customers on their cloud adoption journey, helping to make the cloud transition seamless. The solution provides customers with a management process to govern their business processes and procedures, to see what is working, what new software could help them, and where the opportunities are. SAP Cloud ALM should be used by business and IT together to find out where enhanced software and support may be able to get to the desired outcome faster.</p>
  <p>“The SAP Cloud ALM solution takes a top-down approach and compliments our other tools. The built-in guided help is very intuitive. And with the SAP Early Adopter Care program, we gained greater flexibility. We can use SAP Cloud ALM in our own private cloud while leveraging expert support from SAP,” says Peter Mobert, vice president of Rizing LLC.</p>

  <p>Customers can begin working with SAP Cloud ALM in as little as 15 minutes. One of the key benefits of SAP Cloud ALM is being able to have full transparency on the flow of data with integrated monitoring. Through real-time insight, the solution can automatically be notified of exception events. Other critical benefits include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Smoother business operations without disruptions with proactive monitoring and alerting</li>
    <li>Increased business-process execution quality and performance by finding and analyzing issues on a business process, integration, user, and application level – before they occur</li>
    <li>Having the information of solution health and efficiency with advanced analytics and intelligence, with continuous monitoring.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Customers have been responding to the solution and sharing their positive feedback. Manuel Lozano, Business Support Systems and Business Intelligence manager at Ezentis said, “Thanks to business-process monitoring and real-user monitoring applications enabled in the SAP Cloud ALM solution, we can verify how rollout projects are being adopted, follow business KPIs, and see how users are using SAP S/4HANA Cloud, checking the most-used apps.”</p>
  <p>We are just scratching the surface. If you would like to learn more, <a href="https://webinars.sap.com/alm-summit-emea-2021/en/home">join us</a> October 19-22 for the SAP ALM Summit EMEA 2021.

    <div>
      <div>For many companies, moving to the <strong>cloud is the “next normal”</strong> in business environments. It’s not about “if” anymore – it’s about “when” and “how.” This trend has dominated discussions in the enterprise technology space for a long time and has been further accelerated by <a href="/covid-19">the global pandemic</a>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In a <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3611419/cios-say-public-cloud-migration-is-essential-for-survival.html">recent survey</a> of U.S.-based CIOs, 85% of respondents said that moving to the cloud was the foundation for a future-ready enterprise, enabling improved productivity and providing the speed and flexibility businesses need to respond quickly to changing conditions. The more insecure environments get – and the pandemic, climate change, and many other elements today contribute strongly to insecurity – the more cloud benefits like flexibility and less bundled commitments to technology will play a role.</p>
  <p>Moving to the cloud is not like flipping a switch. Having built up extensive and customized on-premise hardware and software landscapes over time, many companies will need time to move their business processes to a cloud-based environment, especially taking into account the more standardized nature of software as a service (SaaS). This will result in having many different software deployment and consumption models: some will be public cloud, some private cloud or on hyperscalers, some staying on-premise at least in the mid-term. Despite such mixed IT landscapes, customers expect a seamless end-to-end experience from their vendor – especially in support.</p>
  <p>At SAP, this expectation is nothing new. In fact, this has always been core to our support strategy. Even before the days of cloud, SAP strove to offer a comprehensive set of business solutions tightly integrated for end-to-end business processes, with seamless experiences on user interfaces, data, and support. This core principle still fits perfectly in the cloud world and provides enormous opportunity for customer value in landscapes that are hybrid or in transition.</p>
  <p>So, what does end-to-end support mean? At SAP, this is about having a <strong>unified approach to all aspects of support</strong>. The goal is one feature-rich, foundational support offering, one customer-facing support interface, one support infrastructure, and one support organization that maintains a strong global culture of service and expertise.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Currently, SAP solutions are accompanied by our flagship support offering <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/enterprise-support.html">SAP Enterprise Support</a>, which is embedded in cloud subscriptions and is the offering of choice for on-premise SAP software solutions. This can provide our customers with the confidence that they will receive the same high-quality of support for their entire landscape, no matter the SAP solution they happen to be using at any given moment. We understand that one end-to-end business process might touch several systems and SAP software solutions and, therefore, a support issue will not exist in a vacuum of a single product only. We have the expertise and culture of collaboration to look at problems holistically across an integrated SAP environment.</p>
  <p>Here are some recent <strong>examples of our continued expansion of customer value</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In 2020 we launched <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm.html">SAP Cloud ALM</a>, SAP’s next-generation <strong>cloud-based application lifecycle management solution</strong> that includes best practices and mechanisms to manage and monitor integrated landscapes, not siloed by specific products. Developed to support the implementation and operation of SAP solutions, it is continually expanding its coverage of cloud and on-premise deployments.</li>
    <li>We are always striving to find new ways of making access to support easier for our customers. In 2020, SAP launched a new <strong>unified “digital front door”</strong> called <a href="https://me.sap.com/">SAP for Me</a>. The vision for this personalized portal is that customers and partners can access all information, insights, and tasks related to SAP. During the next year, many more support-related tasks and reports will also be made available on SAP for Me to help give customers an end-to-end view of their SAP assets, services, interactions, and more.</li>
    <li>In the last few years, we have introduced new ways for customers to get <strong>direct access to support experts and managers</strong>. It started with <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_519294480">Expert Chat</a> – here, SAP has recently delivered the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sap-customers-get-on-the-spot-support-million-times-heckmann">1,000,000th on-the-spot support</a>. Customers can start a chat directly with a technical support engineer or <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_1575600800">schedule a meeting</a> at their convenience. They can even schedule a <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_193743618">meeting with a support manager</a>.</li>
    <li>Sometimes it’s even better if you can <strong>get a solution automatically</strong>. As you would expect from an industry leader, SAP is exploring the next frontier of support innovation: artificial intelligence (AI). For example, the <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_1903672625">Incident Solution Matching</a> service analyzes a customer’s problem description while they are typing it into the support case and suggests potential solutions. <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html#section_1255553798">Built-In Support</a>, with its digital support assistant, is already available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and will be integrated into more products in time. We have launched the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/27/machine-translation-integration-to-last-communication-from-sap-support-for-customer-incidents">automatic translation of the last incident</a> and support assets like <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/03/07/self-service-machine-translation-for-sap-notes-and-knowledge-base-articles-in-the-sap-one-support-launchpad/">SAP Notes or a SAP Knowledge Base Article</a>. And artificial intelligence can also help spot problems before they occur and provide recommendations to prevent future issues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Through it all, SAP provides the <strong>flexibility</strong> customers need to make the most of their business while saving time and resources. Whether a company is moving to the public cloud, balancing cloud and on-premise solutions, or just exploring cloud elements at its edges, we can provide the support it needs to be agile and resilient in today’s markets.</p>
  <p>The next generation of support is the baseline. It is seamless, end-to-end, proactive, multi-channeled, and intelligent in order to let our customers focus on what matters most to them: driving their business.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Businesses around the world are prioritizing digital transformation, a development that was accelerated by changes due to <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> lockdowns but continues even as societies around the world are beginning to reopen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By 2023, more than half of global GDP will be accounted for by digitally transformed enterprises, according to estimates by <a href="https://www.idc.com/">IDC</a>. “This digital tipping point heralds the emergence of a new enterprise species, the digital-first enterprise,” according to IDC as reported in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2019/10/29/top-10-tech-predictions-for-2020-from-idc/?sh=6f962ae83a27">Forbes</a>.</p>
  <p>As customers continue to transform, SAP must continue to transform to meet their needs. This transformation often leads to hybrid solutions, combining cloud and on premise. SAP customers’ solutions will look fundamentally different a few years down the road, and the trend toward cloud is continuously gaining momentum. We must be ready to meet our customers where they need us.</p>
  <p>To adapt to the new digital reality and to support our customers on their journey requires adopting a cloud mindset. This is something that we have worked hard to develop in the Customer Solution Support &#x26; Innovation organization, which is responsible for supporting all of SAP customers’ solutions end to end.</p>
  <p>Developing this mentality has meant nothing less than the wholesale transformation and reinvention of how our team operates. Although developing a cloud mentality means overcoming some significant hurdles, it is more than worth it, as it is this mindset that will determine the future of business. In three key areas — underlying technology, ways of working, and customer support — we were able to reap the ultimate rewards of a cloud mindset.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="a-cloud-mindset-requires-purpose-built-solutions">A Cloud Mindset Requires Purpose-Built Solutions</h2>
  <p>As an example of what this meant in Customer Solution Support &#x26; Innovation on the tools side, consider SAP Solution Manager. SAP Solution Manager is a typical on-premise product that must be installed on a server and requires its own database; it is a system in and of itself to manage customers’ actual SAP product landscapes. It is no longer logical to have an on-premise system that must be run, operated, configured, and maintained to manage a cloud-based solution. Consequently, the idea of <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm.html">SAP Cloud ALM</a> was born.</p>
  <p>One of the most difficult decisions we made when creating SAP Cloud ALM, our application lifecycle management (ALM) solution for customers that use predominantly cloud solutions from SAP, was to develop it from scratch rather than build off previous software. But in order to realize the true potential of a cloud-native solution, something entirely new was needed.</p>
  <p>It is always tempting to take a shortcut for immediate gain. A common hurdle when adopting a cloud mindset is resistance to developing new solutions when so many of the old ones are still perfectly serviceable. After all, not everyone is using entirely cloud-based systems, and in the short term, some existing technologies — which were themselves time-consuming and difficult to develop — can get the work of today finished.</p>
  <p>While this required more up-front work, there are multiple benefits from the resulting cloud-native system. For one, it is extremely easy to deploy. Any customer that has an SAP cloud product can activate the program practically with the click of a button. It is also easy to scale. A multi-tenant cloud solution should offer the ability to multiply its underlining technical services and have it scale automatically, which is not only powerful today but will be invaluable as our customers continue to move to the cloud.<br>For a true cloud mindset, you must be willing to put in the work up front to experience continuous innovation and regularly provision new features while effortlessly scaling in the future. Still, the development of cloud-native solutions comes along with a change in the way we work.</p>
  <p>This means that individual roles change as well. One example of how a job fundamentally changes with a cloud mindset is the product manager’s role. Traditionally, they look at big features. In a world where you introduce small, incremental changes every day, as is often true of cloud software, releasing innovation to customers is not a discrete event that happens once and then ends. Instead, product managers must learn to break things down into small features and have different groups working on each small feature. There is no grand release; it is a continuous stream rather than a sudden burst of water.</p>
  <p>In a similar vein, programmers must learn to work without dependencies, which are common in traditional software development. In a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) cloud environment, every dependency must be continuously resolved, and changes are being released to customers on a daily basis rather than being collected for a single release date.</p>
  <p>Another example would be the role of a software quality manager. In a world with daily deployments, the old ways of testing software are completely gone and instead, q-managers become test-automation managers.</p>
  <h2 id="a-new-way-to-work">A New Way to Work</h2>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In addition to specific roles, a cloud mindset requires adopting new ways of working. This can be a major hurdle; it is difficult to change old habits and patterns of behavior. However, it’s not impossible, and I have been thrilled to discover that, with a few people guiding the way, the vast majority of people on my teams were able to adapt to new ways of working.</p>
  <p>The difference between traditional work processes and a cloud mentality of work is somewhat like the difference between a pre-recorded show and live television. The pre-recorded show requires a lot of work that ends once the show is released for the week, when work on the next episode begins. With live TV, everything must happen in real time. There are no second takes, and there is no pause between episodes, just a continuous stream of information. And if something goes wrong, it’s going wrong in front of a lot of people.</p>
  <h2 id="a-new-model-of-customer-support">A New Model of Customer Support</h2>
  <p>Finally, adopting a cloud mindset means developing not only new ways of working internally, but also of working with customers.</p>
  <p>Today, many customer business processes have turned into something I call real-time processes. They’re always on, highly mission critical, and have an immediate business impact when they’re not available. If customers are using real-time processes, then we need to offer real-time support. For my organization, this means nothing less than being available for our customers in live expert chat. Customers can choose not to send a support ticket but rather speak to our top product experts live – now! We also offer customers to book live interactions at a time of their choosing.</p>
  <p>Another one of my favorite examples is this. In a traditional, on-premise situation, a customer’s system could receive an individual software change, with a larger change published to all customers afterwards if need be. However, a cloud-first mentality means accepting that changes must be pushed out at regular intervals to all customers. This requires managing expectations: real-time support is invaluable but might look different from what a customer might expect coming from the old system. If a customer wants a noncritical change, the timeline may be different than it once was, while we must be ready to support their critical changes constantly and without delay.<br>From tools to job functions, a cloud mindset requires a fundamentally different way of working, which, vitally, permeates through the entire organization — everyone is touched. However, it also means that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the cloud mindset, and with the proper change management, can create a cohesive group with a shared mission and outlook on the future of the organization.</p>
  <p>What doesn’t change with a cloud mindset, however, is the imperative to constantly delight the customer. The Customer Solution Support &#x26; Innovation organization exists to provide customers with the kind of world-class support they expect from SAP, and that hasn’t changed.</p>
  <p>That’s why I believe we were ultimately successful in adopting a cloud mindset, and it’s this commitment to our customers that we take into every digital transformation we support.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>With every new technology innovation, software functionality, and application enhancement, software developers have the power to shape the future. But to keep serving as transformative change agents, they too must evolve with a mindset that readily embraces the right tools and processes to continuously improve the cloud application lifecycle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of my job is watching people of various skills and experiences work together to positively change the world. <a href="https://learning.sap.com/build-your-career-as-a-developer-with-sap-skills">SAP software developers</a> bring a level of brilliance, ingenuity, and empathy when creating and delivering the innovations, pace of change, and outcomes that our customers desire.</p>
  <p>There is no limit in sight to what our software development teams can produce. However, that fact does not mean that they should not evolve. Businesses now operate in an environment that is quickly shifting away from traditional on-premise software toward more modern cloud-based solutions. And as SAP customers adopt a cloud mindset from their digital transformations, developers should too.</p>
  <p>This realization recently came to life with a breakthrough approach to development. When SAP customers began strategically migrating their on-premise infrastructures to the cloud, we knew the time was rapidly coming when a cloud-based application lifecycle management (ALM) solution would be needed. Delivering this offering – now called <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm.html">SAP Cloud ALM</a> – helped optimize customers’ relationships with its existing and new SAP solutions and its chosen cloud providers and support partners.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="evolving-software-development-for-true-cloud-transformation">Evolving Software Development for True Cloud Transformation</h2>
  <p>Developing SAP Cloud ALM was vastly different from our typical on-premise projects.</p>
  <p>Traditionally, we implement a solution over months and then make it available for download to customers. But even while our customers are using the solution in a productive environment, the technology is updated and re-released as a new version when a critical mass of improvements are made – potentially impacting tens of thousands of installations across our customers’ and partners’ data centers or cloud environments running on SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud.</p>
  <p>With the cloud, SAP can now stop moving applications to various data centers and offer a holistic service that enables customers to realize the speed, agility, standardization, and consolidated intelligence that the cloud promises.</p>
  <p>Our global team of developers had to shift its design and delivery paradigm as quickly as possible to be successful. This meant transforming themselves with the right tools and processes for delivering impactful, cloud-based innovations with a flexible mindset.</p>
  <p>Based on the advice and best practices of development executives from innovation leaders such as Netflix and Facebook, we underwent four fundamental cultural shifts.</p>
  <h2 id="transform-from-on-premise-to-cloud">Transform from On Premise to Cloud</h2>
  <p>Standard delivery of on-premise software is focused on the general availability of new software, completely updated versions, and service packs. Whether these offerings are released annually or biannually, these deliverables feature a bundle of functionalities designed, coded, tested, and quality assured by a team of 200 people. This model may have been profitable, but bug fixes, broken integrations, and requested modifications are inevitable.</p>
  <p>The cloud environment requires a much more purposeful and swift development process. Now, the goal is the daily delivery of new capabilities and updates. SAP runs smaller, more frequent iterations with a defined road map and a portfolio of relevant innovation practices, analytics tools, and process automation – from DevOps to testing and delivery.</p>
  <h2 id="evolve-hierarchies-to-networks">Evolve Hierarchies to Networks</h2>
  <p>In most software development teams, the organizational chart features more than 15 roles and various siloed teams focused on a specific offering, solution capability, or user experience element. Most projects require everyone in the group to be involved – each one with well-defined responsibilities and approval authority.</p>
  <p>By flattening the hierarchical structure, we release developers from the pressure of answering to various people with different opinions and experiences. They are now empowered to do what they do best – engineering. In addition to creating software, developers are taking care of the end-to-end process, including testing, quality assurance, and production.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To help ensure the team stays on track and delivers valuable outcomes for customers consistently, we conduct spot checks throughout the development process. The inclusion of automation into the daily delivery model allows developers to collaboratively structure features by working on small pieces synchronously and integrating their deliverable continuously until all requirements are fulfilled. Ultimately, developers have clear ownership of the feature or version they produce, which is increasing the overall quality and speed of the development process.</p>
  <p>Delivering small changes avoids big bang releases and, therefore, improves availability. For example, massive simplification of code lines is now possible due to this single-trunk approach. Going from 20 code lines to just one is a significant time-saver. Fixes can also be done in 60 minutes, including testing and rolling them out to all customers.</p>

  <p>Daily delivery of new software functionalities and upgrades removes the risk of difficult-to-resolve surprises that often happen with on-premise software. SAP customers’ users can submit a note immediately through the software, detailing where a feature may not work as well, a dashboard could be improved, or an interface could be more seamless. SAP’s development team receives this information in real time, assesses the request, and assigns the appropriate developer to resolve it.</p>
  <p>This design-thinking mindset gives SAP space to listen to customers carefully, understand their needs thoroughly, and deliver on expectations quickly. This methodology prevents the investment of time, money, and resources on features or upgrades that are not used or relevant to customers. By optimizing the balance between nice-to-have capabilities with those that customers must have, SAP can optimize the value and agility of its cloud solutions.</p>
  <p>By offering a minimally viable feature first, customers have a say in how the solution behaves and appears. Then, SAP iterates development in a steady cadence of small increments until customers’ requirements and desires are fully addressed. This approach gives them the freedom to try out new features or upgrade and provide feedback for further refinement and adaptation to the solution based on their needs.</p>
  <h2 id="elevating-the-purpose-of-development">Elevating the Purpose of Development</h2>
  <p>Let’s face it: software providers cannot afford to stick with traditional, on-premise development. Old approaches may be familiar and comfortable, but they do not work in an era where cloud-centric innovations and updates are expected to be delivered continuously, consistently, and quickly. No customer can afford surprises – such as release delays and quality issues – and wait for the next release, months later, to have them resolved.</p>
  <p>So much has changed for SAP’s development team over the last year. The initial motivation may have been a native-cloud project, but everything from the way SAP looks at its projects to the company’s delivery approach has been forever improved. In fact, the term “developer” does not fully describe what SAP’s talented team members do. They are engineers creating a better future for every business and person.</p>
