        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF and AMSTERDAM</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) and the management and technology consultancy BearingPoint today announced they will join forces on carbon and environmental footprint solutions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The companies will collaborate to advance the design and development of a leading-edge solution for customers to help them reach zero emissions.</p>
  <p>Measuring, managing and steering carbon footprints is a key element of reaching zero emissions and part of the climate action program promoted by SAP. Companies are under increasing pressure to determine their carbon footprint not only on a corporate level but also on a product level. However, the data acquisition, consolidation and mapping are challenges that many companies face. Together with the recent launch of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-for-sustainable-enterprises.html">SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a> solution, SAP solutions for sustainability and BearingPoint’s long-standing experience with emission calculations in the market, the companies are well equipped to develop innovative solutions to address customer concerns about environmental footprinting across their value chain.</p>
  <p>“The co-development partnership between SAP and BearingPoint will bring together two strong value propositions. BearingPoint has long experience helping customers identify carbon reduction potentials and achieve sustainability targets. SAP contributes innovation capabilities, broad system landscape and reach to customers. Together as partners we will push the limits to move the economy forward on the path to zero emissions,” said Gunther Rothermel, SVP, Head of SAP S/4HANA Sustainability, SAP.</p>

  <h2 id="carbon-footprinting-for-the-entire-value-chain-scope-1-2-and-3">Carbon Footprinting for the Entire Value Chain: Scope 1, 2 and 3</h2>
  <p>While many companies have already assessed their scope 1, and scope 2 emissions, assessing the entire value chain by introducing scope 3 emissions is key. To do so environmental networks must support data exchange with partners like suppliers, clients, auditors and governments even if they use different IT systems. Building on BearingPoint’s in-depth know-how in product and corporate footprint calculations and algorithms, the SAP Product Footprint Management solution supports data gathering and calculations to help realize end-to-end carbon and environmental footprinting. The SAP solution is fully integrated with SAP S/4HANA and the intelligent enterprise architecture, but also connects with other data sources. This enables it to perform automated assessments of footprints across the value chain, even in heterogenous system landscapes.</p>
  <p>“Together with SAP, we will co-develop utilizing our IP asset and provide a unique solution in the market to measure and optimize the climate impact of products across the entire lifecycle. SAP Product Footprint Management has sophisticated capabilities to determine the carbon footprint of a single product. Our 10-years-plus proven industry experience in calculating and optimizing product and corporate CO2 footprints will enable our joint customers to meet their decarbonization targets. We at BearingPoint believe that together with SAP’s innovative solutions, depth in commercial processes and market expertise we can make a positive impact on the climate,” said Donald Wachs, Head of IP Assets, BearingPoint, and Member of the BearingPoint Management Committee.</p>
  <p>“The partnership with BearingPoint accelerates the SAP Product Footprint Management solution road map and will help make us a market leader in product footprint solutions that support our customers in maximizing the sustainability of their products and services,” said Peter Maier, President, Industries and Customer Advisory, SAP.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Gone are the days when companies discussed the <strong>why</strong> of sustainable business practices. Today, it is all about the <strong>how</strong>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>How can businesses take climate action? How can they turn linear processes into circular resources and product flows? How can they ensure socially responsible value chains? And ultimately, how can they integrate economic, environmental, and social performance into strategic decision-making?</p>
  <p>These questions are top of mind for executives. In 2021, sustainability <a href="https://go.alpha-sense.com/wp-sap-sustainability/">became the top trending topic for the C-suite</a>.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we deliver answers to these questions through our products. Our customers can benefit from solutions that help them achieve <strong>zero emissions</strong>, <strong>zero waste</strong>, <strong>zero inequality</strong>, as well as <strong>holistic steering and reporting</strong> of their sustainability efforts.</p>
  <p>Last year, we launched three new solutions: <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/product-footprint-management.html">SAP Product Footprint Management</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability-control-tower.html">SAP Sustainability Control Tower</a>. All are embedded SAP S/4HANA cloud-native applications that are delivered in a modular way and built on top of SAP Business Technology Platform.</p>
  <p>What is more, we are embedding sustainability across SAP’s entire solution portfolio. A recent example is the inclusion of product footprints in SAP Integrated Business Planning, so customers can monitor the greenhouse gas emissions from their production plants. Another example is the integration of SAP Sustainability Control Tower with SAP SuccessFactors solutions, enabling customers to obtain insights into how their organization is faring on crucial aspects such as diversity and inclusion.</p>

  <h2 id="sustainable-business-strategies-sustainable-enterprises">Sustainable Business Strategies, Sustainable Enterprises</h2>
  <p>For the last 50 years, our innovative solutions have helped our customers transform their business processes and stay ahead in rapidly changing business environments. And we will continue to take and enable organizations of any size and in any industry to take a transformative approach to sustainability as well.</p>
  <p>Quick fixes that do not get to the root cause of problems won’t make businesses more sustainable in the long run. Fragmented sustainability strategies won’t help. Sustainable business strategies will. That is why we support companies in integrating sustainability into the heart of their business processes.</p>
  <p>Our approach pays off. Today, the most sustainable companies run our software. According to our analysis of S&#x26;P Trucost Limited data and <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/esg/solutions/data-intelligence-esg-scores">S&#x26;P Global ESG Scores for 2021</a>, SAP customers with high digital maturity — those adopting SAP’s latest technologies — on average have 75% better environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores compared to their industry peers. They also produce 24% less CO2 emissions than the market average.</p>
  <p>To further facilitate the sustainability transformation for our customers, we recently launched a new offering. <a href="/2022/01/sap-cloud-for-sustainable-enterprises-take-action-together">SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises</a> is a flexible bundle of sustainability-specific applications. It allows businesses to adopt our solutions based on the current stage of their sustainability transformation. Depending on where they stand, they can implement holistic management or start with specific areas of sustainability performance.</p>

  <p>The past year has been all about delivering the tools that help businesses transition into sustainable enterprises. So, what’s next? 2022 will be the year to implement these tools <a href="/2022/01/global-sustainability-ecosystem-power-scale">globally in close collaboration with our customers and partners</a>.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the transition to a more sustainable global economy is not something one company can achieve on its own. In today’s interconnected world, we must rely on our ecosystem to ensure sustainability across the entire value chain. Let’s make 2022 the year we transition toward a more sustainable world, together.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>There is consensus. The recent <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties</a> (<a href="/topics/cop26">COP26</a>) made at least two things clear: we need to move faster toward our goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a fair transition won’t come cheap. Therefore, no enterprise can afford to waste time or money when it comes to aligning their sustainability ambitions with their actions.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Stakeholders are coming to the same conclusions that we have long been convinced of. Even before announcing our Climate 21 initiative two years ago, <a href="/2021/12/sap-leads-sustainability-rankings">we have been seen as front-runners</a> in providing environmental transparency. We have long understood the importance of measuring sustainability progress holistically and connecting financial and pre-financial data. We’ve been doing that since 2012. That’s when we merged our sustainability and annual reports into an integrated report.</p>
  <p>We know that the days of fragmented reporting must end. And now, many more businesses are seeing how fundamental the issues of transparency on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts are. But many businesses still struggle with a multitude of reporting frameworks and lack of appropriate data. This is what stands in the way of consistent investor-focused disclosures. Our planet cannot afford this. Increasingly, consumers want to know the provenance of their products. They want to be assured that they are making choices based on data they can trust.</p>
  <p>The sustainability issues we face today are different from all other previous threats and opportunities — in scope, scale, and ultimately in the consequences. Measuring, reporting, and achieving the sustainable business goals we set is imperative to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-solutions-future-has-already-arrived-thomas-saueressig/?trackingId=sxlQXAPxQ2CzqFo6obbMjQ%3D%3D">net-zero, nature-positive and socially-inclusive future</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="businesses-want-to-make-sustainable-decisions-they-need-the-right-intelligence-to-do-it">Businesses Want to Make Sustainable Decisions; They Need the Right Intelligence to Do It</h2>
  <p>The vast majority of business leaders I connect with want to lead their businesses sustainably. They care about planetary and societal impacts; in fact, their customers, investors, and employees demand it. At SAP, our aspiration goes far beyond enabling businesses to achieve efficiency. We work with customers to reinvent their business processes to achieve sustainable growth. That means enabling businesses to use data in agile ways, across all sustainability dimensions. We provide early alerts that allow companies to be responsive and we give customers the full picture they need to move proactively on their ESG issues.</p>
  <p>Sustainability data is “pre-financial,” not “non-financial.” That means the search for sustainability levers must go beyond the financials to bring together all sustainability data dimensions, including emissions, material flows, and social impacts. We know this and it is why we have made this possible today. For example, with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/product-footprint-management.html">SAP Product Footprint Management</a>, companies get visibility into their carbon footprint data throughout a product’s value chain, including for material sourcing and production. And that’s the insight businesses need to make proactive, sustainable supply chain decisions.</p>
  <h2 id="scale-data-across-business-networks-to-mitigate-planetary-impacts">Scale Data Across Business Networks to Mitigate Planetary Impacts</h2>
  <p>Individual businesses can only do so much. Emissions do not recognize company boundaries and therefore we must help companies reach beyond their own four walls. We know we must connect our customers into a network of intelligent, sustainable enterprises.</p>
  <p>Intelligent cross-enterprise scenarios that enable data sharing across value chains will create impact at scale. Business networks enable companies to continuously re-evaluate and re-engage with each other, creating additional value for their customers and our planet.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>ESG reporting is maturing; there is no doubt about that. Climate-related disclosures are evolving from voluntary to mandatory. Around 100 countries have explicitly expressed support for starting negotiations for a global agreement on plastics in 2022. The European Union is already developing a social taxonomy based on global social and human rights norms. SAP also recently released an <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Joint_Open_Letter_to%20EU_institutions_Future_of_Sustainability_Reporting.pdf">open letter</a> asking the European Union to act on ESG disclosure standards. We want to encourage a global baseline set of standards. We fully support corporate transparency that meets the needs of all stakeholders and improves connectivity between sustainability and financial reporting.</p>
  <p>And, once again, we at SAP have stepped up to provide the solutions that companies need to execute on these evolving standards and connect their environmental, social, and financial values, holistically. Today, I’m proud to say that we just released <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability-control-tower.html">SAP Sustainability Control Tower</a>, a solution that enables customers to go further on their ESG integration and data transparency journey. Our solution enables non-financial — or, as I prefer to call them, “pre-financial” — disclosures focused on four aspects: people, planet, prosperity, and principles of governance. This includes measurements around greenhouse gas emissions, pay equality, and board diversity. It enables comparisons between companies, regardless of industry or region.</p>
  <p>Our two previously released sustainability products, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/product-footprint-management.html">SAP Product Footprint Management</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a>, feed precisely those new data dimensions, which businesses have so far been lacking, into SAP Sustainability Control Tower.</p>
  <p>Our new solution has the World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics as its foundation. These metrics are based on existing standards to make ESG disclosures more comparable and consistent. They were developed within the International Business Council, a community of over 120 global CEOs who seek to improve the ways companies measure and demonstrate their contributions toward creating a more sustainable relationship with our planet.</p>
  <p>And of course, our partners are integral here. Deloitte, EY, and PwC are a few examples of the partners that bring immense knowledge, not only about the framework, but also about the ESG transformations of our customers. Strategic partners like BCG enable our customers to take a holistic perspective toward establishing ESG and climate compliance.</p>
  <h2 id="time-is-of-the-essence">Time Is of the Essence</h2>
  <p>Businesses that set out a 10-year agenda for dealing with their sustainability challenges are moving much too slowly. We all need to move quickly to enable the shift to new business models. Time is of the essence.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we know how important it is that corporate sustainability efforts be measured, reported, steered, and communicated effectively. And I am personally very proud of the <a href="/2021/12/sap-sustainability-control-tower-new-era-sustainability-management">leadership we continue to demonstrate here</a>.</p>

      <div>Back in 2010, Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that the <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us">Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)</a> is to the <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us/20th-anniversary">future of business what the X-ray was to the future of medicine</a> – without it, doctors could never see the inside of a patient’s health. Exactly this kind of laser-like transparency is needed to move the needle regarding the health of the planet, which incidentally contributes massively to the health of the economy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>CDP was founded at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street">10 Downing Street</a> 20 years ago in response to a warning by <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/about/">IPCC scientists</a> that if climate change remained unchecked, the world would warm by six degrees Celsius within the century. As the number of climate-related catastrophes mounted over the years, CDP kept urging companies and governments to report on their emissions and take measurable action.</p>

  <p>Today, the world’s economy looks to <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/companies/companies-scores#1ea1731978553db35dcd1469b155011d">CDP as the gold standard</a> of environmental reporting with the richest and most comprehensive data set on corporate and city action. By scoring companies and other organizations from D to A on climate change, forests, and water security, CDP helps them evolve from disclosing sustainability metrics to taking measurable actions that lead to environmental leadership.</p>
  <p>In light of the recent <a href="/2021/11/cop26-reflections-enabling-business-action-and-planetary-ambition">climate conference COP26</a>, it is apparent more than ever that the private sector has a critical role in driving change and leading by example. SAP enforced its climate action commitment by moving its <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">carbon neutral target up</a> by two years to 2023. This week, SAP received a spot on the prestigious <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/scores">CDP A list</a>, which announces over 300 companies leading the way to a <a href="/">more sustainable future</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/cdp-reports-record-number-of-disclosures-and-unveils-new-strategy-to-help-further-tackle-climate-and-ecological-emergency">2021 was a record year</a>. More than 13,000 companies reported on their environmental impact through CDP, despite the continuing challenges of <a href="/covid-19">the pandemic</a>. This was 37% more than 2020 and 135% higher than when governments signed the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015. Between them, disclosing companies in 2021 accounted for over 64% of global market capitalization, including 96% of the FTSE 100, over 80% of the S&#x26;P 500, and more than 1,500 companies in China.</p>
  <p>SAP’s CDP A rating comes only weeks after SAP was named the software industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for the 15th consecutive year, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/esg/scores/?utm_source=email&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_campaign=YB21_member">identifying</a> SAP as an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) front-runner.</p>

  <p>Achieving top scores in the CDP and DJSI rankings sets SAP apart as exemplar when it comes to disclosure. More importantly, SAP solutions for sustainability help companies measure and monitor their emissions, making it an enabler for companies that want to do due diligence on their own performance.</p>
  <p>“The DJSI and CDP awards recognize Fortune 500 companies that are taking concrete steps to tackle climate change challenges. It is good to receive ongoing independent recognition that SAP is on the right track,” said Daniel Schmid, chief sustainability officer at SAP, responsible for SAP’s sustainability efforts. “It’s equally important to embed sustainability in the business strategy, so that it impacts all aspects of the business. That’s how we can reduce the negative impact on our environment and create regenerative business.”</p>
  <p>SAP customers benefit from a range of products to help them to take climate action or to accelerate their participation in the circular, wasteless economy.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/product-footprint-management.html">SAP Product Footprint Management solution</a> enables organizations to combat climate change by capturing the environmental footprint of products across the value chain so they can build sustainability into the fabric of how they do business. Last month, SAP added <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a> to its portfolio. The solution helps companies gain better visibility of material flows through their processes including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations, especially those concerning product packaging and plastics.</p>
  <p>And finally, <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2021/06/10e155de-e87d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP Sustainability Control Tower</a> helps customers meet their ESG performance targets. This solution enables integration of top-line and bottom-line management with an added dimension – a green line for integrated environmental and social sustainability insights and decision-making.</p>
  <p>The importance of disclosure cannot be underestimated. Business is still business, but in today’s challenging world, the purpose is not to just turn a profit; it’s to remain competitive, relevant, and sustainable while turning a profit. While the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2021/10/21/seeing-beyond-the-sustainability-blind-spot-can-lead-to-long-term-growth/?sh=42b874502f2e">balance sheet may not always show it yet</a>, sustainability is already material to all companies because the fortunes of business are inevitably linked to those of the planet.</p>
  <p><a href="https://insights.sap.com/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness/">A recent survey by SAP Insights</a> found that the more companies believe sustainability is material to their businesses, meaning it is likely to affect their financial condition and should be publicly disclosed, the more competitive and profitable they are likely to be.</p>
  <p>The good news is that after 20 years of running the world’s environmental disclosure system for companies, cities, and regions, CDP finally <a href="https://vimeo.com/239499952">sees a tipping point</a>. With companies disclosing and reporting more than ever before, it’s becoming easier to accelerate change, especially with the right tools and technology at hand.</p>

    <div>
      <div>The climate emergency has reached a new peak. To help accelerate the transformation toward a low-carbon, circular future, SAP is embedding sustainability end to end in its portfolio, as well as across its purpose, vision, strategy, and business operations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Climate change is widespread, rapid, and intensifying, with some trends now irreversible, according to the recent <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/">6th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report</a>.</p>
  <p>The science is clear: unless immediate, fast, and large-scale action is taken to reduce emissions, the average global temperature is likely to reach, or cross, the 1.5° C warming threshold within 20 years. The alarming results are already with us, ranging from droughts and heat waves to wildfires and devastating flooding worldwide.</p>
  <p>While much hope is focused on a green recovery, the window of opportunity is closing fast. The latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that energy-related <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021/co2-emissions">carbon emissions are on course to surge again by 1.5 billion tons in 2021</a>, an increase of nearly 5% year-over-year and the second-largest in history, taking us back to pre-COVID-19 peak levels.</p>
  <p>The urgency to dramatically change course and accelerate decarbonization has never been higher. But only when businesses are moving beyond their siloed approaches, commitments, and climate pledges to fully embrace sustainability and embed these ambitions in an integrated way will we be able to drive the systemic change needed.</p>
  <p>It is a journey toward embedding sustainability across everything we do.</p>

  <h2 id="moving-away-from-add-on-to-core">Moving Away From Add-On to Core</h2>
  <p>Companies need to avoid thinking of sustainability as only an add-on to their strategies and operations. They need to integrate it across the business. Rather than defining a separate sustainability strategy, it is crucial to <a href="https://insights.sap.com/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness/">set a corporate business strategy that is sustainable</a>.</p>
  <p>A first step toward SAP realizing this was linking sustainability to our purpose of helping the world run better and improving people’s lives. The objective: create positive economic, environmental, and social impact within <a href="https://stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html">planetary boundaries</a> with special focus on climate action, circular economy, social responsibility, and holistic steering and reporting.</p>
  <p>This is reflected not only in the updated SAP vision to “reinvent how the world runs as a network of intelligent, sustainable enterprises,” but also in the executive compensation that rewards Executive Board members for customer loyalty, employee commitment, and SAP’s carbon impact, along with financial performance.</p>
  <h2 id="enabling-climate-action-through-technology">Enabling Climate Action Through Technology</h2>
  <p>The IPCC report has once again highlighted that harnessing the innovation power of enterprises has to be at the center of fighting climate change. For SAP, this means using digitalization to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2021-04-74301-unglobalgoals/Climate_Action">including #13, Climate Action</a>.</p>
  <p>In collaboration with customers and partners, SAP is working to optimize material, financial, and energy flows throughout end-to-end business processes in order to address planetary and social challenges. For example, <a href="/2020/06/climate-21-track-greenhouse-gas-emissions">the company’s multi-year Climate 21 program</a> helps build analytical and transactional capabilities into enterprise applications that can help SAP customers understand and minimize the greenhouse gas footprint of their products and operations along their value chains.</p>
  <p>During the <a href="https://events.sap.com/sap-sustainability-summit/en/home">SAP Sustainability Summit</a> in April, <a href="/2021/06/sapphire-now-sustainability-management-by-sap">sustainability management by SAP</a> was introduced, providing an expanded portfolio of sustainability-specific solutions, including <a href="/2021/09/sap-product-footprint-management-launch">SAP Product Footprint Management</a>, which has been available since September 2021. There is more to come with the releases of the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/21/helping-business-thrive-in-a-circular-economy/">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a> and SAP Sustainability Control Tower solutions in the next months, as will be shown during <a href="https://events.sap.com/sap-sustainability-summit/en/home">SAP Sustainability Day October 28</a></p>
  <p><a href="https://sap.io/">SAP.iO</a> Foundries locations Berlin and Munich are fostering startup innovation by setting up the <a href="/2021/03/sapio-sustainable-future-cohort-accenture">Sustainable Future program</a> together with Accenture. The equity-free program is designed to propel digital transformation in four target areas: carbon tracking and trading, resource efficiency, climate risk tracking and mitigation, and circular economy.</p>
  <h2 id="setting-ambitious-targets">Setting Ambitious Targets</h2>
  <p>In addition to harnessing innovation, the climate emergency calls for bold targets for decarbonization. By mid-2021, countries representing around 65% of global carbon dioxide emissions and more than 70% of the world economy have made ambitious commitments to carbon neutrality. The U.S, the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and others — in total 126 countries — have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050; China says it will do so before 2060.</p>
  <p>The private sector also needs to step up. More than 1,900 companies, including SAP in 2017, have set emissions reduction targets grounded in climate science through the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/about-the-science-based-targets-initiative/">Science Based Targets initiative</a>.</p>
  <p>In 2019, SAP raised its commitment and adopted a <a href="/2019/07/sap-emissions-reduction-targets">1.5° C science-based emissions reduction targets</a> aligned with a net-zero future. However, the journey started much earlier; back in 2009, SAP set the first goal of reducing its global carbon emissions to the year-2000 level by 2020. <a href="/2018/03/sap-integrated-report-2020-targets-met-early">This target was met at the end of 2017</a>, even though SAP grew more than fourfold over the period.</p>
  <p>The next milestone is 2023, when SAP aims to be <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">carbon neutral in its own operations</a> – two years earlier than previously envisaged. This includes all direct (Scope 1), indirect (Scope 2), and selected categories of value chain (Scope 3) carbon emissions, such as business flights, employee commuting, paper consumption, and external data centers (co-locations and hyperscalers).</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is essential to measure and monitor progress on the path toward achieving these targets. For example, SAP has increasingly embraced holistic steering and reporting because connecting financial and pre-financial performance leads to better management decisions and business success.</p>
  <p>SAP’s sustainability and annual reports were merged into the <a href="http://www.sapintegratedreport.com">SAP Integrated Report</a> in 2012. Since then, both material and immaterial value creation have been at the center of the company’s reporting and have been placed on an equal footing. Besides key financial information, environmental progress, workforce information, and social investments have been made transparent. In addition, an internal sustainability dashboard allows employees to explore the key sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs), such as women in management and carbon emissions by their country, location, and line of business, with updates every quarter.</p>
  <p>Our reporting shows that in 2020, SAP was able to overachieve by 43% on its target for net carbon emissions in 2020, generating 135 kilotons instead of the anticipated 238 kilotons. This trend continued in the first half of 2021, during which SAP’s carbon emissions totaled 45 kilotons compared to 90 kilotons in the first half of 2020 (-37%).</p>
  <p>The low emissions level is a consequence of the ongoing <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic, as well as the introduction of <a href="/2021/06/pledge-to-flex-future-of-work-at-sap">Pledge to Flex</a>, which enables a more flexible mix of remote and onsite work. SAP believes this trend will continue and has just announced in its <a href="https://www.sap.com/docs/download/investors/2021/sap-2021-half-year-report.pdf">2021 half-year report</a> that it has lowered its 2021 carbon emissions outlook from 145 kilotons to a range of 90-110 kilotons.</p>
  <h2 id="taking-action-measures-of-implementation">Taking Action: Measures of Implementation</h2>
  <p>To become <a href="/2017/05/sap-to-go-carbon-neutral-by-2025">carbon neutral in its own operations by 202</a>3, SAP is following a three-pillar approach: <strong>avoid</strong>, <strong>reduce</strong>, <strong>compensate</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Whenever possible, SAP aims to avoid the creation of greenhouse gases. This is a top priority, supported by, for example, using virtual telecommunication instead of business flights.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce:</strong> If greenhouse gas emissions cannot be avoided, SAP aims to drive efficiency and reduce all types of emissions; for example, building efficiency, data center operations, carpooling and car sharing, and e-mobility.</li>
    <li><strong>Compensate:</strong> SAP has extended its compensation models for travel. For business flights, it has introduced an internal carbon price to offset related carbon emissions. If greenhouse gas emissions cannot be eliminated altogether, SAP aims to reduce them through innovations in the areas of building efficiency, data center operations, carpooling, and car sharing, as well as e-mobility. For example, SAP has powered its own data centers and facilities with 100% renewable electricity since 2014, implemented an environmental management system with ISO 14001 certification in more than 30 countries and ISO 50001 at headquarters, adopting green IT initiatives in order to foster sustainable IT equipment usage and promoting tools such as <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia</a> as a default search engine.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In 2020, SAP implemented additional energy and climate measures within its operations, ranging from opening a new office with energy-efficient design in Australia and implementing more efficient data center technology in Germany to introducing a bike fleet at SAP Hungary as well as a flexible mobility budget in Germany and installation of photovoltaic systems in Austria.</p>
  <p>For emissions that cannot yet be reduced or avoided, SAP thirdly invests in high-quality carbon credits. For example, <a href="/2020/08/sap-lcf-investment-livelihoods-carbon-funds">SAP has been a long-term investor of the Livelihoods Carbon Funds (LCF) since 2012</a>. SAP has also donated funds to restore ecosystems and improve people’s lives. In support of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030, SAP recently joined the 1t.org corporate alliance, which aims to conserve, restore, and grow trees worldwide, with a <a href="/2021/07/enhancing-sustainability-people-technology-21-million-trees">pledge to plant 21 million trees by the end of 2025</a>.</p>
  <p>I am proud that SAP’s efforts to combat climate change and to strengthen its transparent reporting are <a href="/2021/01/corporate-knights-cdp-sap-top-esg-ratings">externally recognized</a>. The non-profit organization CDP included SAP on its <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/companies/companies-scores?cid=9205306762&#x26;adgpid=95799580520&#x26;itemid=&#x26;targid=kwd-870315494871&#x26;mt=b&#x26;loc=9041983&#x26;ntwk=g&#x26;dev=c&#x26;dmod=&#x26;adp=&#x26;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxpSS4e_Z7gIVjLh3Ch2xkAciEAAYASAAEgLpJPD_BwE">A List 2020</a>, thereby granting us the top rating for leading in environmental transparency and action.</p>
  <h2 id="partnering">Partnering</h2>
  <p>SAP recognizes that strong partnerships are an invaluable asset in tackling climate change. This is why we became a founding member of the European Green Digital Coalition and joined the World Economic Forum Stakeholder Capitalism Coalition and CEO Climate Leaders as well as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), complementing our previous engagements with the UN Global Compact, the We Mean Business Coalition, the Value Balancing Alliance, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and many more.</p>
  <p>In addition, we signed the <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org%2Fg20-2021%2F&#x26;data=04%7C01%7Cpreeti.srivastav%40eu.asahibeer.com%7C6b7d2eeaddaf447c6e2e08d97822af12%7C7ef011f8898a4d0182329087b2c2abaf%7C0%7C0%7C637672913526232765%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&#x26;sdata=jX%2BiZ7Ipm3Wm9sXEgD6AbZ%2BWKk%2B4sePJIfTDXi7qNEI%3D&#x26;reserved=0">business letter to the G20</a> calling for greater climate ambition and we launched <a href="/topics/chasing-zero">Chasing Zero</a>, a new initiative that will feature executive thought leadership, best practices, and insights into a sustainability-related transformation of SAP and its global ecosystem to achieve zero emissions, zero waste, and zero inequality. The transition to a circular economy remains central to our vision for a world of zero waste and plastic free oceans by 2030. Consequently, we support stronger circular economy policies, such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature’s OneSource Coalition and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Extended Producer Responsibility endorsement.</p>

    <div>
      <div>For decades it has been clear that the Earth’s climate is changing and our influence on the environment is undisputed. The latest UN (IPCC) <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362">report</a> is the most dire warning ever issued on climate change and a wake-up call for all of us to realize that we can only ensure a sustainable future by taking action.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As a frontrunner in the sustainability movement, SAP has a crucial role to play as an exemplar – such as <a href="/2021/03/sap-carbon-neutrality-goal-2023">committing to become carbon neutral by 2023</a> – as well as in helping businesses unlock their potential growth. This is possible through optimizing circular business models with practical and scalable SAP solutions such as <a href="https://youtu.be/AGLb0VzHRO4">SAP Product Footprint Management</a>, which enables companies to account for greenhouse gas emissions in their end-to-end business processes. While SAP’s focus is on innovations that help customers become more sustainable, we as individuals should lead by example by taking steps that lead to a more sustainable living, such as using alternative modes of transportation or reducing single-use plastics.</p>
  <p>Following the vision of a <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-circular-economy/">circular economy</a>, businesses and individuals are advised to set the focus on repurposing and reusing materials, following a cycle of make, use, return, and reuse.</p>
  <p>Achieving circular business models requires completely rethinking supply and value chains across industries to create end-to-end transparency. In the quest to turn waste into value, SAP developed <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/agriculture-supply-chain-mgmt.html?btp=f206a795-9c52-4614-91ea-8928281922e2">SAP Rural Sourcing Management</a>, a solution that can improve visibility into resources across value chains, helping companies understand, control, and manage their impact on the environment. For example, it is estimated that the fashion industry is responsible for <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/fashion-industry-may-use-quarter-of-world-s-carbon-budget-by-2050-61183">10% of global carbon emissions</a>, and, according to UNFCCC, the sector’s emissions are to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/fashion-industry-un-pursue-climate-action-for-sustainable-development">rise by more than 60% by 2030</a> if transformation towards a sustainable fashion industry fails to materialize soon.</p>
  <p>A great use case where the SAP Rural Sourcing Management solution helps streamline the journey to a circular economy is through a sustainable network of businesses, connecting plastic waste collectors in Ghana with recycling companies, manufacturers, brands, and consumers of fashion. In Africa <a href="/2020/10/minimize-plastic-waste-in-ghana-domestic-recycling">less than 20% of plastic waste is being recycled</a>, while the European Union sets a target of 50% by 2025. Ghana has committed to turn this issue into an opportunity by creating a domestic recycling industry that creates jobs as well as supports a clean environment. In urban areas of countries such as Ghana, waste collecting is a means of survival. However, many urban dwellers have poor visibility into the market price of the collected materials, leaving them vulnerable to imposed pricing.</p>

      <div><strong><a href="https://insights.sap.com/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness/">Learn more</a></strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Through the implementation of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/agriculture-supply-chain-mgmt.html?btp=f206a795-9c52-4614-91ea-8928281922e2">SAP Rural Sourcing Management</a>, waste collectors in Ghana can directly connect to waste aggregators to receive a fair and transparent wage. The plastic resources are then handed over to the recycling companies to transform it into reusable resources. Being transported to different factories and manufacturers, plastic can be used in the production of fashion items. Using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/logistics-business-network.html">SAP Logistics Business Network</a>, full traceability can be achieved along the entire supply chain to help ensure expectations and standards for sustainable production and fair conditions are met.</p>
  <p>To connect and manage the business operations steps within any fashion business, SAP supports brands and retailers that want to capture and control the value of products after sale with recommerce. The aim is to enable and connect recommerce-specific business processes that include buying back, managing, and reselling pre-owned inventory, as well as tracking key financial, customer, and sustainability performance indicators. Any fashion brand can maintain visibility and control re-commerce business to fully capture the opportunities at stake – a profitable reselling business, positive environmental impact, customer acquisition, and expansion of the customer lifetime value.</p>
  <p>SAP technology provides solutions that can transform serious environmental challenges, such as plastic waste, into integral parts of the circular economy. It can bring people and businesses with shared values together to jointly create a more sustainable value chain, where products are used, returned, reused, and given a new purpose.</p>

  <p>By integrating emissions data across all solutions that govern production processes with master data from business applications such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Product Footprint Management can calculate the environmental impact of various production scenarios.</p>
  <p>“When companies embed emissions data into underlying business processes, leaders can drive real change by making conscious decisions across the entire value chain,” Saueressig said, noting that SAP is uniquely positioned to drive this change throughout collaborative, intelligent, and sustainable business networks.</p>
  <h2 id="saps-commitment-to-sustainability">SAP’s Commitment to Sustainability</h2>
  <p>SAP has been leading by example in sustainable business practices for more than a decade. In addition to being named the software industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for 14 consecutive years, SAP’s membership in the <a href="/2019/08/value-balancing-alliance-sap-founding-member">Value Balancing Alliance</a> and use of the annual <a href="https://www.sap.com/integrated-reports/2020/en.html">SAP Integrated Report</a> illustrates our commitment to integrating economic, environmental, and social performance to drive business decisions.</p>
  <p>“SAP has long had a strong, dedicated focus on its own sustainability operations,” said Marta Muñoz, senior research director and lead, Technology &#x26; Sustainability Practice, IDC EME. “The launch of the SAP Product Footprint Management solution, combined with the <a href="https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy/Climate/SOS-1.5/Resources/Value-Chain-Carbon-Transparency-Pathfinder-Enabling-decarbonization-through-Scope-3-emissions-transparency">WBCSD’s Pathfinder Project</a>, represents a unique opportunity to bring together companies to jointly drive decarbonization across value chains and industries.”</p>

  </p>
  <h3 id="q-whats-the-significance-of-this-product-launch-for-sap">Q: What’s the significance of this product launch for SAP?</h3>
  <p><strong>Rothermel:</strong> All of us can see climate change impacting not only our customer’s operations, but also our own personal lives. SAP Product Footprint Management is an incredibly important milestone along our path to help customers systematically monitor and control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across their end-end business processes. To support their decarbonization journey, the solution delivers data transparency on their environmental footprint and enables them to make more informed decisions in real time.</p>
  <p>The potential impact cannot be overstated. Boston Consulting Group analyzed the <a href="https://www.bcg.com/press/21january2021-supply-chain-decarbonization-offers-a-game-changing-opportunity-to-fight-climate-change">emissions across the eight major supply chains</a> and found that around 40% of GHG can be eliminated with measures that bring cost savings or are at costs of less than €10 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent. Just imagine what we and our customers can achieve together.</p>
  <h3 id="competition-for-sustainability-management-software-is-heating-up-how-is-sap-differentiating-itself">Competition for sustainability management software is heating up. How is SAP differentiating itself?</h3>
  <p><strong>Varshney:</strong> A number of new technologies are emerging to facilitate the identification, tracking, trade and offset of GHG emissions, and established players and as well as newer, small vendors are coming out with innovative solutions applying leading technology to solve complex problems. As long as we stay focused on our core business capabilities and deliver innovations on top of SAP Business Technology (SAP BTP) platform, we can position ourselves as a front runner in solving environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues at scale. We can differentiate ourselves from the competition in three ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Differentiated impact of our product offerings:</strong> With our portfolio, we will enable organizations to assess and reduce their carbon footprint, increase resource productivity through circular processes, and run safer, sustainable business processes while providing industry-specific insights that combine operational and financial data across value chains.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep process integration:</strong> By embedding sustainability data into end-end business processes across value chains, we can help our customers adapt their key business processes to be more sustainable.</li>
    <li><strong>Co-innovation with ecosystem partners:</strong> In close collaboration with our partners, customers, market makers, and standard bodies, we will jointly shape and accelerate innovations for the future sustainability landscape, which enables and drives new redefined business process models.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="whats-the-role-of-sap-btp-how-can-our-customers-use-these-cloud-services">What’s the role of SAP BTP? How can our customers use these cloud services?</h3>
  <p><strong>Rothermel:</strong> SAP BTP plays a very important enabling role for us. We are building our new sustainability solutions along cloud engineering principles, based on open, flexible architecture on top of SAP BTP. We are also making full use of key additional platform capabilities.</p>
  <p>For instance, we are closely working with the SAP BTP team to build SAP Data Warehouse Cloud and SAP Analytics Cloud content for our upcoming solution SAP Sustainability Control Tower. We are also following an ‘API-first’ approach for our new services, helping our partners more easily adapt and integrate their own solutions on top of the foundation that we deliver from SAP. This enables us to jointly address most critical use cases in different industries, enabling our customer to manage their environmental, societal, and planetary impact.</p>

  <p><strong>Varshney:</strong> During their life cycle, products move from material acquisition and pre-processing to production and storage, and finally, downstream to distribution, delivery, use, and end-of-life. SAP Product Footprint Management enables transparency regarding environmental footprints across this full product life cycle. For this, we are taking a holistic approach and are now also embedding emissions data into our other products like SAP Integrated Business Planning, SAP Ariba and others.</p>
  <p>Two more products will be announced soon: SAP Responsible Design and Production and SAP Sustainability Control Tower. With SAP Responsible Design and Production, we empower businesses to eliminate waste and support compliance to extended producer responsibility schemes. This will allow them to manage their limited resources productively throughout their life cycle. With SAP Sustainability Control Tower, we enable our customers to improve performance and long-term valuation by embedding sustainability metrics and insights into core business processes.</p>
  <h3 id="what-was-the-most-challenging-aspect-of-the-project">What was the most challenging aspect of the project?</h3>
  <p><strong>Rothermel:</strong> There is a lot of time pressure given the urgency the topic has for SAP, the industry, and society overall. I am extremely proud of what my team has accomplished in a very short time window. Although the team was only set-up in the fourth quarter of last year, we delivered on our promised innovations on time despite the restraints of <a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a>. With the sustainability management program, colleagues came together and each has played a significant role in shaping this product, the first significant innovation focused on the vision of a sustainable intelligent enterprise for our customers.</p>

      <div>The time for climate action is now. Many are talking about it. We are acting. This is humanity’s chance to recalibrate and respond to the dire threats we ourselves created. We are continuing to deeply embed sustainability into the enterprise software this world needs now more than ever. With the help of our solution portfolio, SAP – together with our unparalleled customer and partner base – is best positioned to systematically reduce carbon emissions and help business tackle today’s most complex challenges.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“The world is on fire,” according to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2018/a-world-on-fire">satellite images captured by NASA</a> and a recent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-astronauts-saddened-to-see-climate-crisis-wildfires-from-space-2021-8">Business Insider interview</a> with astronauts from the International Space Station. While many parts of the world deal with extreme heat, others struggle with extreme flooding. The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/">recent United Nation (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate report</a> says nations are “nowhere close” to the level of action needed to fight global warming and the effects of extreme weather caused by climate change. The need for climate action is undeniable and opportunities for green house gas (GHG) reductions are within our grasp. Action to date has been slow, but it’s accelerating.</p>
  <p>I see a surge in companies seeking to reduce GHG emissions coming. November’s upcoming <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">COP26</a>, the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, is set to ensure that action around science-based target setting will accelerate. And I’m hearing from industry and government leaders that we will see unprecedented corporate climate action, driven by regulation and good business, that aligns with the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/climate-math-what-a-1-point-5-degree-pathway-would-take">1.5 degree of global warming limit set by the Paris Agreement</a>.</p>
  <p>Pressure from governments and consumers is mounting as climate change is unfolding before our eyes — faster even than scientists predicted. I’m watching the upcoming COP26 where the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation’s International Sustainability Standard Board (ISSB) will be launched in November. This robust, <a href="https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/sustainability/ey-the-future-of-sustainability-reporting-standards-june-2021.pdf">globally consistent sustainability reporting standard</a> will adopt a climate-first approach and have a big impact on our customers.</p>
  <p>Our customers are asking us to help them make the necessary change at scale. And we are ready to help them meet the requirements. But many businesses have moved forward without reassessing their business models or focusing on the underlying process, data, and governance changes that they must make to accurately measure, manage, and reduce their carbon emissions. Why? Because it’s complex!</p>
  <p>Calculating environmental and social impacts across a company’s products and services and across the entirety of their life cycles is simply complicated. Yet supply chain emissions are on average <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/research/global-reports/transparency-to-transformation">11.4 times higher than operational emissions</a>. So merely focusing on individual operational emissions is no longer enough. Actually, it was always just a first step.</p>
  <p>Understanding complex business challenges and optimizing existing business processes has always been SAP’s strength. The breadth and depth of our industry expertise, spanning 50 years, enables us to help businesses today to not just optimize, but reinvent their business processes, like no other company can. That’s what today’s challenges call for.</p>
  <p>As we near our 50-year company anniversary, we build on that legacy today by enabling business to meet new challenges. We know that dashboarding is not enough. When we embed emissions data into underlying business processes, leaders can drive real change by making conscious decisions across the entire value chain. That’s what scales the transition to low carbon pathways, and SAP is uniquely positioned to drive this change across collaborative, intelligent, and sustainable business networks.</p>
  <p>These activities are interconnected and must be done together to achieve maximum impact. Our business software applications bring together materials, energy, and financial flows to steer businesses in a holistic way. These are not add-ons. We have found significant value from the interconnectedness of these factors over our decade of integrated reporting and steering, and are working closely with our customers through organizations such as the <a href="https://www.value-balancing.com/">Value Balancing Alliance</a> to accelerate this approach for all sectors.</p>
  <p>We not only enable individual intelligent enterprises, we connect them to each other. We support the move from intelligent sustainable enterprises to a network of intelligent sustainable enterprises. This is the key to achieving real change for the planet. Just as GHG emissions go beyond the four walls of a company, efforts to reduce those emissions must also extend beyond individual companies, into the network of companies.</p>

  <p>While every company can start by focusing on their own individual supply chains, those further down the path to sustainability can use the <a href="/2021/08/value-networks-sustainable-business">network as a pathway to scale</a>. <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/08/0605ebb8-f07d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">According to IDC</a>*, “Consolidating data into a unified network means better access, streamlined analysis and the opportunity to more effectively turn insights into action.” Systemic industry change needs the network effect, and it needs a spark.</p>
  <p>The customer base that we currently serve covers 94% of the world’s 500 largest companies which represents an immense capacity for real change at scale. Partnerships also help accelerate our product innovation. SAP is <a href="https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/News-Insights/General/News/SAP-Joins-the-World-Business-Council-for-Sustainable-Development-to-innovate-in-global-decarbonization-effort">innovation partner in WBCSD’s Value Chain Carbon Transparency Pathfinder</a>, dedicated to enhancing transparency in corporate carbon emissions with the objective to ultimately decarbonize supply chains.</p>
  <p>We emphasize the role of technology for the green transition and EU taxonomy as a founding member of <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-green-digital-coalition">European Green Digital Coalition</a>. In addition to working with these established partners and others, SAP is supporting sustainability innovation from startups around the world. For example, through our <a href="https://sap.io/sustainability/">SAP.iO Foundries</a> program, startups play a pivotal role in catalyzing innovations on sustainability across the globe.</p>
  <p>We facilitated systemic industry change 50 years ago with our enterprise software based on our founders’ vision. Now we are doing it again in order to tackle the climate crisis. The business model innovation we drive helps improve energy efficiency across both conventional and renewable energy value chains, it supports decarbonizing through electricity generation and transmission such as green hydrogen, and it helps our customers to decarbonize their products and services, for example, by adopting circularity.</p>
  <p>We have not slowed down on our promise to innovate in this product space throughout the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>. Just recently, we made our <a href="/">SAP Product Footprint Management solution generally available to our customers</a> to support them in monitoring, analyzing, and reducing emissions to deliver on their climate commitments.</p>
  <p>We are building for the future. And I believe that future is coming faster than anyone even thought.</p>

        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced the availability of SAP Product Footprint Management, a solution that lets companies calculate carbon footprints for their products and across the value chain. It considers the entire product lifecycle, helping companies disclose their products’ environmental footprints to regulators and enabling them to make their products more sustainable.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP Product Footprint Management is part of a new portfolio of sustainability-specific business applications that deliver transparency and measurement capability across the supply chain, allowing companies to move toward lower carbon emissions and more sustainable operations.</p>
  <p>“Customers want it, the world needs it. There is no time to waste for businesses to act more responsibly and sustainably. Sustainability goals are increasingly as important to business success as financial goals,” said <a href="/">Thomas Saueressig</a>, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and responsible for SAP Product Engineering. “When companies embed emissions data into underlying business processes, leaders can drive real change by making conscious decisions across the entire value chain. That is what scales the transition to low emission pathways, and SAP is uniquely positioned to drive this change throughout collaborative, intelligent and sustainable business networks.”</p>
  <p>By integrating data across all solutions that govern production processes with master data from business applications such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Product Footprint Management can calculate the environmental impact of various production scenarios. For example, <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/02/product-deep-dive-welcome-to-product-footprint-management-from-sap/">a cookie company</a> can choose its source for chocolate based both on the cost of the raw material as well as on its carbon footprint.</p>
  <p>SAP’s data-driven approach lets businesses embed sustainability comprehensively and gain actionable insights across the entire value chain to enable companies to transition to low-carbon business processes. Taking a differentiating approach, SAP enables businesses to proactively identify the carbon impact at the beginning of the product lifecycle instead of reactively after a product has been produced. Moreover, SAP Product Footprint Management not only equips companies with the insight to reduce carbon emissions across their value chains but can enable data exchange with customers, suppliers and business partners — driving transparency across a company’s scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions.</p>
  <p>SAP Product Footprint Management, a cloud-native solution built on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a>, is designed to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions. Proposed governmental regulations designed to combat the harmful effects of climate change could cost businesses <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/supply-chain/environmental-supply-chain-risks-to-cost-companies-120-billion-by-2026">up to $120 billion</a>. A recent IDC survey showed linking financial and environmental indications in financial reporting, as well as reducing carbon emissions, are top topics for IT decision-makers.*</p>

  <p>I grew up in Germany and can still remember when we started to separate our trash for recycling back in the 80s or 90s – our rivers and forests were suffering, and the environment was becoming a big topic. Even though we have seen progress on this front here in Germany, if you look at the global situation today, it’s clear we need to do more. It goes far beyond separating our trash. I sometimes wonder if I am part of the last generation that had the privilege to grow up in a world where natural disasters were an exception rather than the rule. Thinking about my own children, this is certainly a gut-wrenching thought.</p>
  <p>I do not know if there is a guide through a slow-motion emergency, but the fact that climate change is already at our front door is inescapable. With the current state of the planet setting the context for us, talking about sustainability is talking about survival. It is about redefining growth, rethinking progress, and limiting financial risk. How we view our business or our industry will be a key driver in how well we proceed in creating a sustainability vision for our organization, both from within and without.</p>
  <p>And <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability.html">sustainability is core to our vision at SAP</a>. By placing sustainability at the front and center of our purpose, SAP’s strategy underlines the importance of technology, and specifically technological innovation, in enabling and accelerating climate action, hand in hand with our customers and partners.</p>

  <p>With <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA Cloud</a>, we are uniquely positioned to create a lasting, positive impact for our future generations. Leveraging SAP’s exemplary track record of managing enterprise resources for close to five decades, we want to collaborate and work closely with our customers to transition to sustainable business models. Our vision to enable customers to transform into intelligent, sustainable enterprises is based on our shared values in “<a href="/topics/chasing-zero">chasing zero</a>“: zero emissions (GHG), zero waste, and zero inequality.</p>
  <p>By integrating sustainability data into end-to-end business processes across industries and value chains, we can have a significant impact and accelerate the pace of change needed. In close collaboration with our partners, customers, market makers, and standard bodies, we intend to jointly shape the future sustainability landscape that enables and drives new, redefined business process models.</p>
  <p>The success of the <a href="https://events.sap.com/sap-sustainability-summit/en/home">SAP Sustainability Summit</a> in April this year clearly shows that our ecosystem is ready to join forces with us, making it clear that business leaders — in addition to their top and bottom lines — also want to focus on managing their “green line” for sustainable business success. This has become the guiding principle for the way we want to evaluate and steer businesses in the future.</p>

  <p>SAP S/4HANA Cloud’s sustainability portfolio addresses four dimensions, including climate action, circular economy, holistic steering and reporting, and social responsibility.</p>
  <p>Through a highly differentiated set of products, we will enable organizations to assess and reduce their carbon footprint, increase resource productivity through circular processes, and run safer, sustainable business processes while providing industry-specific insights that combine operational and financial data across value chains, embedded in core business processes.</p>
  <p><a href="/">SAP Product Footprint Management has now been released</a>. In the next few months, we will release SAP Responsible Design and Production, already available as beta, and SAP Sustainability Control Tower, and we will deliver innovations via modular embedded SAP S/4HANA Cloud services, based on an open, flexible architecture built on top of SAP Business Technology Platform. We will continue to expand across the breadth of our SAP portfolio, bringing additional capabilities with SAP Business Network and different lines of businesses, addressing most critical use cases in different industries to enable our customers to manage their environmental, societal, and planetary impact.</p>
  <p>SAP Product Footprint Management is an embedded SAP S/4HANA cloud-native application that enables our customers to optimize their business decisions by integrating footprint scores, preconfigured and flexible, in end-to-end business processes, periodically and at scale, considering the entire product life cycle. Our customers can gain insights by combining financial, logistic, and environmental data in analytics and can evaluate and derive footprints at scale by leveraging SAP S/4HANA Cloud data and capabilities as much as possible.</p>
  <p>SAP Product Footprint Management is preconfigured, prescriptive, and focuses on business users (persona-based). It is based on SAP’s business data and application logic and is consistent in the calculated product footprints being integrated into the end-to-end operational processes covering all relevant business users in every department.</p>

  <p><em>SAP Product Footprint Management – Business Architecture (click to enlarge).</em></p>
  <p><a href="/">SAP Product Footprint Management is an answer to various challenges</a> that our customers have encountered, whether it is the availability of emissions data to calculate product footprint across the product life cycle or the availability of calculation adhering to standards aligned to GHG Protocol ISO 14040. These indicate that high efforts are required for calculating the footprints and understanding how to use the results or the data gained from it to better optimize the way businesses are run.</p>
  <p>Businesses agree that they need to calculate the footprint on a product level in the future, but they are unsure about how to go about it. They are still exploring different data and calculation methods. Our customers want to calculate the product footprints and then they want to analyze it — with their own tools.</p>
  <p>To evaluate the environmental impact of the collected business data and goods movements and to be able to calculate footprints at scale, this data needs to be combined with emission factors. <a href="https://www.ecoinvent.org/">Ecoinvent</a>, a not-for-profit organization, is our first partner to offer product-related emission factor datasets from its database. Building on more than 20 years of experience in lifecycle assessment methodology and around 18,000 datasets covering global supply chains, the ecoinvent emission factor datasets can be, with a license, easily imported into SAP Product Footprint Management.</p>
  <p>In the future, we plan to enable other content providers as well so that our customers can use every provider whose data is standardized as per our applications.</p>
  <p>It is important to establish a clear governance, ownership, and process for managing and reporting on carbon emissions. Clarity on governance will in turn drive the clarity on underlying data needs, as well as system requirements. Our partnership with the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and Accenture on <a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/sdg-ambition">SDG Ambition</a> is an important component of our sustainability efforts. SDG Ambition aims to engage leaders across more than 1,000 companies in over 40 countries over the next two years and draw greater focus on making sustainability core to business strategy.</p>
  <p>With our technologies, we will enable our customers to accelerate their journeys to achieving ambitious targets, helping them advance the integration of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into their core business systems, thereby systematically working toward their <a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/events/climate-action-summit-2019/business-ambition">Business Ambition for 1.5°C</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="completing-the-picture-by-achieving-sustainability-multi-dimensionally">Completing the Picture by Achieving Sustainability Multi-Dimensionally</h2>
  <p>With <a href="https://www.sap.com/hk/products/ehs-management-health-safety.html">SAP Environment, Health, and Safety Management</a>, we enable our customers to manage their corporate environmental footprint — air, water, waste, carbon — as well as their GHG emissions at a corporate level. SAP Product Footprint Management captures product lifecycle emissions required by Product Standards, as outlined in <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf">GHG Protocol</a>.</p>
  <p>To approach the challenge of climate change in a holistic manner and to expand it along further aspects, including water, energy, and land use as well as social dimensions, we need to begin at the core: SAP S/4HANA Cloud.</p>
  <p>Having recognized and taken this major step, we plan to build on it and will expand to include and embed exchange emissions data into our line-of-business applications, including procurement, travel, and expense, to help bring a complete emissions transparency for our customers through SAP Sustainability Control Tower.</p>
  <p>As an example, companies can gain visibility into carbon footprint data throughout a product’s supply chain, bringing the ability to take sustainable supply chain decisions based on actionable insights. Product-related carbon footprint data, such as for production, material sourcing, or transport, from SAP Product Footprint Management can be utilized in <a href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=67838200100800006742&#x26;range=2021Q4-2021Q4#Q4%202021;INNO=000D3A47875C1EEB96E01207898774B6">SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain</a>.</p>
  <p>The issue of sustainability can sometimes be overwhelming and it is easy to feel hopeless. But because it is a global, complex issue, it has risen to the forefront, not only in policy conversations about how to make a change, but also in the business consciousness. There is a real shift happening now in terms of how we view climate change and how we believe we can turn concern into action.</p>
  <p>Businesses are well positioned to lead on innovations and technology that will help slow down their impact on the environment and recognize that business can only succeed if society thrives.</p>
  <p>While there is no ready-made, off-the-shelf answer to the questions our next generation asks us, we simply must make sure that what we do today gets us closer to where we want to be tomorrow — because what we save also saves us.</p>
