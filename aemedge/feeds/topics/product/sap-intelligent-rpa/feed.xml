  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>SAP Process Automation — a simpler way to enhance business efficiency and agility with confidence — is now generally available, providing a powerful new tool for businesses looking to create value faster.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/about/events/teched-news-guide/low-code-no-code-pro-code.html#article2">Previewed last year at SAP TechEd</a>, SAP Process Automation combines the capabilities of SAP Workflow Management and SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation in an easy-to-use, no-code experience powered by artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
  <p>The new solution enables organizations of all sizes to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simplify automation with visual drag-and-drop tools and industry-specific content</li>
    <li>Automate faster with business context in a unified AI-powered workflow management and robotic process automation solution</li>
    <li>Manage processes and automations with confidence on a trusted, enterprise grade, multi-cloud platform</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here’s a closer look at why process automation is in demand, how it helps modern businesses to create value, and how customers can take advantage of this cutting-edge technology.</p>

  <h2 id="the-need-for-process-automation-continues-to-grow">The Need for Process Automation Continues to Grow</h2>
  <p>“Gaining value by focusing on process automation continues to be a key driver for businesses that need to drive down their operating costs or speed up cycle times,” according to Maureen Fleming, program vice president, Intelligent Process Automation Market Research and Advisory Service at IDC. “Organizations are thinking about upskilling business users to become more proficient in using process automation tools for both their own and their team’s productivity efforts, enabled by a next generation of intelligent process automation solutions combining low-code task and workflow automation with AI decision support, intelligent document processing, and process mining.”</p>
  <p>Customers like Stadtwerke Gelsenkirchen are already realizing benefits from SAP Process Automation. This offering allows employees to engage in business-critical activities that create value, rather than being trapped in routine tasks.</p>
  <p>“SAP Process Automation will support many SAP customers in digitalizing their paper-based processes and optimizing transparency and cycle time,” said Stefan Schmidtke, SAP Application Manager at Stadtwerke Gelsenkirchen. “Integrating it with other SAP solutions offers the possibility for employees to get rid of repetitive tasks so that they can focus on higher value topics.”</p>
  <h2 id="build-with-simplicity">Build with Simplicity</h2>
  <p>SAP Process Automation simplifies process automation with visual drag-and-drop tools and pre-built industry-specific content. Business users can now build workflows as well as automate tasks and decisions with ease and, if needed, collaborate with development teams to meet all their automation needs.</p>
  <p>To jump-start projects, users can select from a quickly growing library of more than 340 pre-built process flows, forms, business rules, dashboards, and bot automations across applications, lines of business, and industries. For example, SAP S/4HANA content is available for more than 100 automation scenarios in the finance, manufacturing, sales, services, sourcing and procurement, and supply chain lines of business. <a href="/topics/human-resources">SAP SuccessFactors</a> and SAP Ariba software development kits (SDKs) provide predefined activities to easily automate key tasks in these applications, augmented by SDKs for popular office productivity tools for desktop automation. All of this is readily available in a dedicated store accessible directly from SAP Process Automation.</p>

    <div>
      <div>When it comes to responding to an urgent need by quickly developing an automation solution to minimize laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone manual work, robotic process automation (<a href="/topics/rpa">RPA</a>) delivers great value.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But this is just a first step. Taken to the next level, intelligent RPA, also called “hyperautomation,” offers even more valuable benefits by combining traditional RPA with artificial intelligence (AI) and low-code/no-code development.</p>
  <p>As an example, repetitive tasks and routine activities in finance, purchasing, and customer service were preventing Villeroy &#x26; Boch, one of Europe’s oldest ceramic manufacturers, from improving operational efficiency and delivering great customer service. The German premium tableware and bathroom products company implemented SAP Intelligent RPA for routine activities, helping streamline workflows and free up staff to focus on strategic activities.</p>
  <p>Like other SAP customers benefiting from hyperautomation, Villeroy &#x26; Boch started with automating simple, frequently occurring tasks, such as responding to standard e-mail inquiries with attended RPA bots. Previously known as robotic desktop automation, attended RPA is a software assistant for the human user and interacts with a desktop application while respecting applicable business logic.</p>
  <p>Operating internationally in 125 countries demands smooth workflows and operational efficiency across several business functions, but the ceramics group always had a bigger vision. The company wanted to create a fully automated invoice error-handling process by combining SAP Intelligent RPA and SAP AI Business Services to handle unstructured data and documents.</p>
  <p>Now advanced RPA bots autonomously trigger tasks and automate more complex work such as processing attachments from e-mails according to their type and predefined confidence thresholds. So far, the 10 digital assistants Villeroy &#x26; Boch has deployed are handling 66,000 documents a year.</p>
  <p>“Although we’re just at the beginning of our journey with SAP Intelligent RPA, we are already realizing its potential to help us work more efficiently, serve customers better, and gain competitive advantage,” said Daniel Neuhaeuser, head of ERP Core Solutions at Villeroy &#x26; Boch.</p>
  <p>The advantages of going beyond traditional RPA and tapping the potential of hyperautomation are becoming more widely acknowledged. Industry analysts have forecast that the worldwide hyperautomation-enabling software market will reach nearly US$600 billion by 2022.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hyperautomation services such as SAP Intelligent RPA enable companies to quickly and easily create bots to emulate human users and automate tedious, repetitive, mundane tasks. For example, today’s office workers spend a lot of time moving between different applications and must often reenter or copy and paste data, such as a customer’s name and address details, from one application to another.</p>
  <p>Earlier this year, SAP Intelligent RPA was cited as a Strong Performer in <a href="https://reprints2.forrester.com/#/assets/2/702/RES161538/report">The Forrester Wave™: Robotic Process Automation, Q1 2021</a>. According to the report, “SAP’s RPA solution is a strong alternative for SAP customers, particularly for enterprises concerned with bots disrupting core SAP systems and those usually needing the central SAP development team to design, develop, and maintain RPA for clear accountability, or for companies seeking a feature-rich RPA tool that comes with a broad ecosystem of partners.”</p>
  <p>Typically, customers report that SAP Intelligent RPA deployments free up between 15 and 30% of employees’ time, which means they can focus on tasks that deliver greater value to the organization and improve the customer experience.</p>
  <p>Specific benefits of using SAP Intelligent RPA include being able to use tools such as <a href="https://insights.sap.com/tackling-software-developer-shortage-citizen-developers-lcnc/">low-code or no-code platforms</a>, built-in integration and content for business process management, and fast, cost-effective deployment. By opening current tools to everyone in the enterprise, SAP Intelligent RPA extends its reach beyond software developers. Business users who have no coding skills but have functional expertise and technical acumen can become citizen developers and build their own automations.</p>
  <p>To support this mission and help automate tasks in business processes, SAP Intelligent RPA offers a new bot-building and execution experience and a cloud-based design studio. This allows users to create and deploy software bots as digital assistants that automate repetitive tasks through a low-code approach.</p>
  <p>This low-code tooling speeds up implementation time and offers a short time to value. More than 200 prebuilt bots are now available within SAP Intelligent RPA to help automate tasks, improve productivity, and make work more interesting for employees.</p>

    <div>
      <div>It’s been a long time since developers have hand-coded everything from scratch. I remember being an IT systems engineer at the Hasso Plattner Institute in 2007 — things were very different than they are today.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Since then, the <strong>demand for professional developer talent has continued to grow</strong> faster than the world can educate them. In part to deal with this challenge, technology developers have increasingly composed software by working with libraries and the like, rather than rewriting the same code over and over. Working this way saves time and gives more agility.</p>
  <p>Today, the latest progression of this trend can be found in the low–code and no–code (LCNC) solutions for application development, extensibility services, experience management, and end-to-end process automation.</p>
  <p><a href="/covid-19">COVID-19</a> is considered an accelerant for digital process automation — it is, of course — but the space was already rapidly developing. LCNC solutions that empower more employees to digitize and automate their work offer a pathway to greater enterprise resilience. The pandemic brings the benefits of such agility into stark contrast, further propelling adoption. Take robotic process automation (RPA) for example, where Gartner predicts “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-21-gartner-says-worldwide-robotic-process-automation-software-revenue-to-reach-nearly-2-billion-in-2021">90% of large organizations globally will have adopted RPA in some form by 2022</a>.”*</p>
  <p>The goal of these technologies is to allocate human resources more intelligently and to empower the end user — the professional developer as well as the citizen developer — to focus on more valuable work while taking control of digitizing and automating their processes. <strong>LCNC is faster, more efficient, and frees up professional developer time for more complex activities</strong>, like security and big migration/integration projects. Most importantly, LCNC and automation technology build systemic resiliency and responsiveness into the daily functioning of a large organization, while fostering compliance and governance, with defined workflows and clear responsibilities.</p>

  <p>As large companies aim to become more future-proof, they see LCNC and automation platforms as an immediate opportunity on the horizon. Gartner indicates that “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3991199/magic-quadrant-for-enterprise-low-code-application-platf">by 2023, over 50% of medium to large enterprises will have adopted an LCAP as one of their strategic application platforms</a>.”</p>
  <p>Low-code application development platforms (LCAPs) mainly provide tools and services to easily set up and configure processes and workflows, whereas automation platforms enable companies to easily automate recurring manual work. This begins with the conversion of paper-based processes into digitized workflows then leads to the seamless combination of digital workers with human-led processes.</p>
  <p>With decades of process knowledge across industries and lines of business, SAP is well-positioned to provide the expertise and tooling needed by our customers to advance automation with LCNC digital transformation.</p>
  <p>We are firmly established with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) and citizen automation products for Business Process Improvement such as <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/workflow-management">SAP Workflow Management</a> and <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/intelligent-rpa">SAP Intelligent RPA</a>.

  <h2 id="2020--how-sap-became-an-rpa-vendor">2018-2020 — How SAP Became an RPA Vendor</h2>
  <p>Let me tell you how SAP started in the RPA market: Three years ago, after having been part of SAP’s machine learning initiative, I decided to focus on creating further value for SAP customers by automating business processes. For this, we put together a strategy and a business case and built a development team. We merged SAP technology with proven RPA technology from Contextor, <a href="/2018/11/sap-acquires-contextor-robotic-process-automation">acquired in 2018</a>.</p>
  <p>May 8, 2019, was a great day for us, with the launch of SAP Intelligent RPA at SAPPHIRE NOW; our booth and our sessions were fully packed and we received a lot of positive feedback from SAP customers and partners.</p>
  <p>We rapidly closed our first customer deal with <a href="/2021/02/process-automation-villeroy-boch-bots-decide">Villeroy and Boch</a>, and the solution spread further. It received a lot of interest from more customers and partners that experienced our <strong><a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/td/sap-intelligent-robotic-process-automation-free-trial.html">free trial</a></strong> to experience the outcomes of our solution in their own IT landscape.</p>
  <p>Via many interactions with our ecosystem and analysts, sharing our road map, and getting new ideas, we constantly improved SAP Intelligent RPA. We enabled more than 50 partners worldwide, which helped us grow our customer base in any industry and any region of the world. End of 2020 we reached a major milestone with 1 million automations over the year:</p>

    </picture>According to a survey from another analyst firm in the fourth quarter of 2020, SAP is already in the Top 3 Automation Product Suppliers across the Global 2000 companies. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/global2000/">Global 2000</a> is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world created by Forbes magazine. Published since 2003, it is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. These very large companies are the core of SAP customers, many of them having deployed SAP ERP and other SAP software for decades.
  </p>
  <p>This survey shows that we have succeeded in providing these customers with an SAP solution that fits their needs. Three months ago at <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/14/sap-intelligent-rpa-2.0-sap-teched-2020-is-a-wrap/">SAP Teched</a>, we unveiled SAP Intelligent RPA 2.0, a major release of our product geared toward democratization of automation. It offers bot-building capabilities following a low-code or no-code approach, enabling non-technical business process experts to create customizable automations with clicks, not code. In addition, <a href="https://store.irpa.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/">more than 170 prebuilt bot templates</a> are available to automate and drive efficiencies in 12 lines of business for any industry, with about 60 prebuilt bots only for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html">SAP S/4HANA</a>.</p>
  <p>This new release of SAP Intelligent RPA provides high flexibility while helping ensure IT governance. It received great feedback from the customers: “Great job, we saw and experienced many steps that have become much easier during the robot creation process,” said Balbir Singh Dhillon, Associate Director Intelligent Solutions at Zuellig Pharma. “Just the email capabilities alone save a lot of time and places that functionality in the hands of the citizen user and no longer dependent on experienced developers. The look and feel and the user experience were really great, and I can only see the product getting richer with additional features.”</p>

  <p>At the end of last year, Forrester invited SAP to participate in its evaluation, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/robotic-process-automation.html?campaigncode=CRM-PM21-SIP-INTTECHFOR&#x26;rc=https%3A%2F%2Freprints2.forrester.com%2F%23%2Fassets%2F2%2F702%2FRES161538%2Freport">The Forrester Wave™, Robotic Process Automation, Q1 2021</a>. The report is now published, and in this evaluation, SAP was cited as a Strong Performer.</p>
  <p>According to the Forrester report, “SAP’s RPA solution is a strong alternative for SAP customers, particularly for enterprises concerned with bots disrupting core SAP systems and those usually needing the central SAP development team to design, develop, and maintain RPA for clear accountability, or for companies seeking a feature-rich RPA tool that comes with a broad ecosystem of partners.”</p>
  <p>We could not agree more. Creating an RPA solution for SAP customers, our aim was to bring an automation tool that fits in their IT landscape and fulfills all of their governance requirements. Because their enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a key component of their daily operations, it is finely tuned by the IT department to run smoothly. For sure, our customers do not want any disruption in the way their ERP runs and need that any software robot interacting with the ERP to be fast and efficient, but without any risk of generating extra system load.</p>
  <p>The prebuilt bot templates available in our SAP Intelligent RPA store are directly created and maintained by major SAP product teams, such as SAP S/4HANA already and soon SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Ariba. This approach offers a strong cohesion among existing SAP systems in place, increasing the bots’ performance. Our prebuilt bots are constantly updated and upgraded to support our customers’ latest ERP, HR, or <a href="https://www.ariba.com/solutions/solutions-overview/procurement">procurement software</a> releases.</p>
  <p>We aim to provide the best RPA solution for SAP customers and this will go far beyond robotic process automation. The <strong><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-process-intelligence.html">business process intelligence</a></strong> portfolio is a strategic initiative from SAP to deliver process excellence by analyzing, improving, and monitoring processes. Together with SAP Workflow Management, SAP Intelligent RPA turns process insights into actions to help drive digital transformation. It allows non-technical users to create automation scenarios without code, and to deliver outcomes quickly with predefined content.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>German ceramics manufacturer Villeroy &#x26; Boch is using SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation (SAP Intelligent RPA) and SAP AI Business Services to automate simple, repetitive tasks. The bots that handle these tasks are quick and easy to build and implement because they do not require any changes to the existing IT infrastructure.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Villeroy &#x26; Boch has been manufacturing porcelain and ceramic goods for more than 270 years – since 1748, to be precise. Today, the company employs almost 7,500 people, generated revenues of over €800 million in 2019, and sells its products in more than 125 countries. A business with such a long tradition – and its eyes set firmly on the future – needs one thing above all: a willingness to continuously embrace change and evolve.</p>
  <p>That applies, of course, not just to the products a company sells, but also to its business processes. Villeroy &#x26; Boch began operating its first serial production line back in 1767 and opened a state-of-the-art, mechanized dinnerware factory in 1801. Manufacturing has obviously come a long way between those early days and the introduction of intelligent robotic process automation. But there are parallels: Now, just as then, innovative machines aim to free staff from the burden of repetitive tasks and reduce the risk of human error.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="many-more-potential-use-cases">Many More Potential Use Cases</h2>
  <p>SAP Intelligent RPA leverages capabilities of autonomous software robots – “bots” – and artificial intelligence (AI). The bot in daily use at Villeroy &#x26; Boch, for example, reads incoming e-mails, scans the attachments, uses trained algorithms to classify them, and saves them to the correct location. The system automatically distinguishes between invoices and payment reminders, meaning that employees no longer need to open those documents and classify them manually. In this way, the Document Classification service – part of SAP AI Business Services – automatically prepares documents for further processing by employees.</p>
  <p>At Villeroy &#x26; Boch, the technology now works in “unattended” mode, meaning that it completes tasks without human intervention and monitoring. The time saved is significant; the machine checks between 20 and 30 emails every day, and that number is rising.</p>
  <p>“It was important for us, aside from leveraging the intelligent RPA functions, to be able to make decisions based on unstructured data as well. A combination of Document Classification and SAP Intelligent RPA makes that possible,” says Daniel Neuhäuser, head of ERP Core Solutions at Villeroy &#x26; Boch. The fact that a subscription for SAP AI Business Service could be easily purchased on <a href="https://www.sapstore.com/">SAP Store</a> was another point in its favor.</p>
  <h2 id="making-bots-even-more-intelligent">Making Bots Even More Intelligent</h2>
  <p>Although there are currently no forerunners to learn from – Villeroy &#x26; Boch is the first SAP customer to use the automatic Document Classification service – Neuhäuser sees still more potential for robotic process automation with intelligent services at his company, such as in finance, customer service, and purchasing.</p>
  <p>To enhance the existing bot, he and his colleagues are already testing another SAP AI Business Service, Document Information Extraction. This service allows the bot to read documents that have been classified, extract business-relevant information from them (invoice numbers, vendor names, and so on), and enrich this information with additional master data (such as business partner numbers). In the medium term, the company could use this service as a foundation to enable automated invoice processing and posting in SAP ERP.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For Neuhäuser, there are two compelling benefits to RPA, the use of bots, and SAP AI Business Services. First, bots can be built and deployed without changing the existing IT infrastructure. Second, bot-building requires less effort and expertise than conventional software development.</p>
  <p>“We don’t need ERP experts for this,” he says. “What we need most of all are bot developers. And we reach our goals much faster.” This is because key users are involved right from the start, and their feedback is channeled continuously into the development process, which means that the application is ready to go live very quickly.</p>
  <p>And what part does the IT department play? “We follow a mixed development approach,” says Neuhäuser. “Sometimes IT is more closely involved, sometimes less. But the people who will use the solution always play a key role in development from the get-go.”</p>
  <h2 id="low-effort-high-impact">Low Effort, High Impact</h2>
  <p>SAP Intelligent RPA helps optimize autonomous bots with artificial intelligence. Because it removes the need for human intervention after every step, this technology enables significant time savings. Also, it can be developed without changing the existing IT landscape – and without ERP expertise. SAP Intelligent RPA helps to relieve teams from the burden of recurring administrative tasks, creating a long-lasting impact with comparatively little effort.</p>

      <div>I’m still buzzing from last week’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> announcement; I firmly believe this new Business Transformation as a Service offering is a going to be a veritable game changer for businesses: bundling products and services to allow customers to start and to progress on their intelligent enterprise journey on their own terms, and at a pace that suits them.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Of course, our market-leading intelligent enterprise resource planning (ERP) <strong>SAP S/4HANA Cloud</strong> is a cornerstone of this offering. Regular product updates serve to provide customers with innovations and enhancements that can be consumed immediately in order to seize new business opportunities, strengthen their market position, streamline operations, and build resilience in more challenging times.</p>
  <p>As the last 12 months have clearly demonstrated, when the world we know is turned on its head, those businesses able to sense changes and identify potentials, able to adapt quickly to unforeseen needs and unfamiliar circumstances are the ones best positioned to emerge strongest from the <a href="/covid-19">pandemic</a>.</p>

  <p>Just like previous updates, today’s release of <strong>SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2102</strong> provides customers with new capabilities to further the successful transformation of their business. Short development sprints and continuous delivery coupled with a close relationship with companies in all industries and user groups around the world allow us to prioritize capabilities that we know our customers need <em>now</em> and can benefit from straight away. Allow me to share with you some of the key additions in this latest release.</p>
  <p>A company’s financial operations are like the oil that keeps an engine running smoothly. Particularly in challenging times, a well-managed cash flow is crucial. And in a volatile business environment, companies need to be able to act and adapt swiftly to changing circumstances. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud for finance, we introduce the <strong>simulation cockpit for integrated financial planning</strong>, which allows management and controlling stakeholders to perform what-if analysis and simulate the impact of changes in factors like sales quantity or personnel expenses. A further highlight in the area of finance is the <strong>flexible assignment of accounting principles to ledgers</strong>. In order to run parallel accounting processes in their systems, customers need to use several accounting principles — for example, IFRS and a local accounting principle such as HGB. New customers that use SAP Central Business Configuration to configure their systems can now flexibly assign the accounting principles they require to their respective ledgers. And the best thing: a single configuration is required to assign the ledger to the accounting principle throughout SAP finance applications such as general ledger, treasury, and revenue recognition.</p>
  <p>In recent releases we have focused significant development efforts on building out new capabilities in <strong>solution order management</strong>, which support customers to transform their product to higher-margin solutions comprising complementary products and services. This release sees the introduction of <strong>subscriptions for consumption-based business</strong>, integrating SAP Subscription Billing and allowing users to create subscription services as well as sales and service products in a single order. This facilitates the sale of revenue-boosting bundles of physical products together with one-time, recurring, and consumption-based services.</p>
  <p>Turning our attention to the sales department, I cannot help but think of the old adage “Time is money.” Intelligent automation in the creation of sales orders means a real boost to the efficiency of sales teams. A sales representative who doesn’t have to invest high manual effort into creating orders in the system can already move on to the next sale without delay. The SAP Fiori app in SAP S/4HANA Cloud release 2102 creates <strong>sales orders from unstructured data in PDF files</strong>. After a purchase order file in PDF format is uploaded, the system automatically extracts master data from the file. This data is saved in a sales order request, which can later be converted into a sales order. This user-friendly approach considerably reduces manual — and often error-prone — effort.</p>
  <p>The smart application of <strong>intelligent technologies</strong> is key to any company’s digital transformation. Each update of SAP S/4HANA Cloud brings additional tools to increase the intelligence of your business processes. One highlight in this release is in the use of <strong>machine learning algorithms to provide system support in maintenance notifications</strong>. Maintenance technicians or supervisors can have the system suggest the most likely damage code by automatically analyzing information that is already collected through the maintenance process. This can significantly shorten the time needed to assign the correct damage code to a maintenance notification, speeding up the time to resolution for the customer. It also improves data quality for later breakdown analysis.</p>
  <p>We also continue to grow the intelligence and automation of SAP S/4HANA Cloud through <strong>SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation</strong> – hundreds of predefined bots are available to help drive automation within your business. See the <a href="https://rapid.sap.com/bp/">SAP Best Practices Explorer</a> and the <a href="https://store.irpa.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/order=asc/search=/tag=/type=business_content">SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation bot store</a> for more information.</p>
  <p>This just scratches the surface of the innovations delivered with SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2102. Of course, there are further enhancements across all areas of the product for the benefit of all lines of business.
