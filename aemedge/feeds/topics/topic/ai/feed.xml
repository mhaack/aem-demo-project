  <p>Successful businesses keep moving and evolving, especially in times of rapid change and macroeconomic uncertainty. And given the current volatility, business transformation is no longer optional; it’s imperative.</p>
  <p>Knowing this, we launched RISE with SAP in 2021 not as a technical IT migration approach, but as a comprehensive solution designed to drive broad business transformation. With 6,000 customers having selected RISE with SAP, we know we cannot stop moving either. And I was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ1yFoALzAs">thrilled to share at SAP Sapphire this year</a> how we are taking the RISE with SAP experience to the next level and improving services and delivery for customers end-to-end.</p>
  <p>Here are some key takeaways.</p>
  <h2 id="evolving-how-we-engage-with-customers">Evolving How We Engage with Customers</h2>
  <p>Navigating the transformation of today’s complex system landscapes and business processes is like orchestrating a symphony with countless instruments and moving parts. To succeed, we need to keep refining our engagement approach to better manage the intricacies of our customers’ complex architecture at an unprecedented level of detail.</p>
  <p>To this end, we’re making a lot of changes in how we engage with customers, including strengthening the role of the enterprise architect (EA). The EA harmonizes all elements and guides the customer throughout their cloud journey.</p>
  <h2 id="enhancing-methodologies">Enhancing Methodologies</h2>
  <p>We know the biggest challenge for any cloud transformation is to make the system landscape more agile and enable innovation — quickly. We’ve been listening and have introduced solutions. For example, our <strong><a href="/2024/04/transform-confidence-rise-with-sap-methodology">RISE with SAP Methodology</a></strong> is a significant step forward in creating a consistent experience for all RISE with SAP customers, independent of their individual cloud journeys. Now, a dedicated enterprise architect guides customers through the RISE with SAP Methodology to enhance onboarding and provides transparency throughout the project with key milestone checks, q-gates, and checklists that ensure consistent quality and more predictable timelines throughout the implementation process.</p>
  <p>This new offering is included in our <strong><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/rise.html#migration">SAP RISE Migration and Modernization</a></strong> program, which is designed to give customers the confidence to migrate even the most complex ERP systems to the cloud. By enabling our customers to integrate and extend SAP S/4HANA with a clean core approach, we ensure our customers experience better maintainability and lower total cost of ownership.​ Because legacy ERP systems often carry technical debt and, let’s face it, code is also a liability not just an asset. The more code you have, the more you have to optimize, debug, and modernize. And this is something we all need to actively work against.</p>
  <h2 id="introducing-partner-training-and-validation">Introducing Partner Training and Validation</h2>
  <p>We are also making it easier for RISE with SAP customers to identify partners to help with complex SAP S/4HANA Cloud transformations. It is essential for our partner ecosystem to follow the RISE with SAP Methodology as well. For customers to onboard successfully, there needs to be a close alignment between SAP, the customer, and implementation partner. This is why we are training and validating partners to use the RISE with SAP Methodology and will collaborate closely with partners to provide consistency and quality.</p>
  <p>We are also introducing the <strong>RISE with SAP Validated Partner</strong> recognition, which verifies a partner’s adherence to the RISE with SAP Methodology and our q-gates, giving businesses the confidence to know that they are fully leveraging the potential of cloud-based innovations from SAP. Almost 90% of all SAP implementations are overseen by partners, so training and validating them is a key part of our strategy to ensure consistency and quality for customers.</p>
  <h2 id="building-a-seamless-end-to-end-tool-chain">Building a Seamless End-to-End Tool Chain</h2>
  <p>As a former SAP CIO, I’ve felt the challenges (and pain) of large-scale transformation. I know the pressure CIOs are under to show tangible business outcomes quickly. It’s why true business transformation requires a holistic approach, not a simple technology lift and shift.</p>
  <p>We deliver the most complete business transformation suite in the industry. With the range of capabilities on offer today — including SAP Signavio, SAP LeanIX, and SAP Cloud ALM solutions as well as SAP Business Technology Platform — we have an amazing set of tools to bring out the best in businesses. Now, we are bringing them more closely together as one end-to-end seamless tool chain to make it easier to manage the process, system, and data landscape holistically.</p>
  <p>With our recently announced <a href="/2024/06/sap-enters-agreement-to-acquire-walkme">agreement to acquire <strong>WalkMe</strong></a>, we plan to further strengthen our ability to deliver successful business transformation across applications, processes, systems, and people. ​WalkMe will help us incorporate user-centric adoption, enablement, and productivity capabilities alongside our Business Transformation Management portfolio of SAP Signavio and SAP LeanIX solutions. And WalkMe’s AI capabilities will complement our process AI with user intelligence, improving the capabilities of our <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html">generative AI copilot Joule</a> to help people get work done faster.​</p>
  <h2 id="sap-business-ai-new-frontier-for-business-transformation">SAP Business AI: New Frontier for Business Transformation</h2>
  <p>In 2024, SAP Sapphire has been an opportunity for us to showcase how we are introducing in a new era of optimized business operations, with all the IT complexity concealed behind intuitive, AI-powered user experiences.</p>
  <p>We highlighted the progress we are making embedding Joule throughout our enterprise portfolio and the enormous potential we see for AI to support both customers and partners in their RISE with SAP journey. I was thrilled to announce that starting in Q4 of 2024, customers and partners can leverage generative AI-powered assistance for their RISE with SAP clean core success plan.</p>
  <p>We are also bringing new consulting capabilities to Joule, aimed at simplifying SAP implementations for partners. The new consulting capability draws insights from SAP product documentation and the SAP community to provide consultants with vital information and is planned to be available in the second half of this year.</p>
  <h2 id="business-transformation-more-than-an-it-project">Business Transformation: More Than an IT Project</h2>
  <p>At SAP, we understand that true business transformation is more than an IT project. It requires a holistic approach and not a simple technological lift and shift. That’s why we are putting the people, methodologies, financial incentives, tools, partner practices, and SAP Business AI in place to ensure our customers not only have compelling reasons to move to the cloud, but also a compelling experience.</p>

        <h1 id="what-is-deep-learning">What is deep learning?</h1>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that mimics a brain’s neural networks to learn from large amounts of data, enabling machines to solve complex problems.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="deep-learning-definition">Deep learning definition</h2>
  <p>Deep learning is a type of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-machine-learning.html">machine learning</a> that enables computers to process information in ways similar to the human brain. It's called "deep" because it involves multiple layers of neural networks that help the system understand and interpret data. This technique allows computers to recognize patterns and manage complex tasks, such as translating languages and driving cars autonomously. Similar to how humans learn from experience, these systems improve their skills and accuracy over time by analyzing vast amounts of data, without needing manual updates from humans.</p>
  <h2 id="understanding-neural-networks">Understanding neural networks</h2>
  <h4 id="from-theory-to-perceptron">From theory to Perceptron</h4>
  <p>In the 1940s, Warren McCulloch, a neuroscientist, and Walter Pitts, a mathematician, collaborated to create the first artificial neural network concept. Their goal was to understand how the brain could produce complex thought patterns from the simple binary responses of neurons. They introduced a model of the neuron, which they believed could mimic the brain's ability to perform complex calculations using binary logic.</p>
  <p>In the neural network model developed by McCulloch and Pitts, inputs act like the electrical impulses a neuron receives. If some inputs are more crucial for a specific result, the model emphasizes these through greater weight. When these weighted inputs exceed a certain level, the neuron activates; if not, it remains off. This basic on-off mechanism enabled their model to mimic simple brain-like decision-making processes, setting the stage for deep learning's evolution.</p>
  <p>In 1957, the introduction of the Mark I Perceptron, a room-sized machine built by computer scientist and psychologist Frank Rosenblatt, showcased the first practical use of artificial neurons. This device used photocells and artificial neural networks to recognize and categorize images, demonstrating the effectiveness of McCulloch and Pitts' ideas. Rosenblatt's Perceptron not only confirmed that machine learning could work but also paved the way for the development of today's more sophisticated deep learning technologies.</p>
  <h2 id="how-does-deep-learning-work">How does deep learning work?</h2>
  <p>Deep learning works by using the process of prediction to determine which algorithms in their neural networks are the most successful at producing outputs that meet human expectations. Then, the networks use backpropagation to refine those algorithms so that their rate of success improves. Here’s an example:</p>
  <p>Imagine you're teaching a computer to recognize different genres of music. The neural network analyzes thousands of music files, gradually learning to notice features like instrumentation, beats, and chord progressions. When it makes a prediction, like identifying a piece as a rock song, and is then told whether it's correct, it uses a method called backpropagation to adjust its algorithm.</p>
  <p>This is like learning from mistakes. For example, if the computer mistakes a classical piano sonata for a rock song, it learns from this error, refining its ability to distinguish between classical and rock songs in future predictions. Over time, this process enables the artificial neural network to make highly accurate predictions, turning it into a powerful tool for everything from recommending movies based on what you like to enabling self-driving cars to interpret road signs and signals.</p>
  <h3 id="a-deeper-dive-into-deep-neural-network-layers">A deeper dive into deep neural network layers</h3>
  <p>This list explains the essential components of a deep neural network and the general order in which they function. However, neurons, activation functions, and regularization techniques are not isolated steps, but rather features that operate throughout the network and its learning process.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Input layer</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The input layer is the gateway into the network, where each neuron represents a unique feature of the input data. This layer's primary function is to receive the raw data and pass it to the subsequent layers for further processing.</p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Neurons (nodes)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Neurons, or nodes, are the fundamental processing units of a neural network. Each neuron receives input, processes it (using a weighted sum and then applying an activation function), and sends the output to the next layer.</p>
  <ol start="3">
    <li>Activation functions</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These are like the decision-makers in a neural network, helping it determine what to learn and what to ignore. They add a kind of flexibility to the network, allowing it to capture and learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-blogs/logistic-regression-in-machine-learning/ba-p/13427397">sigmoid</a>, ReLU (rectified linear unit), and tanh.</p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>Weights and biases</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Weights are parameters within the network determine the influence of input data on the outputs within the network's layers. Along with weights, biases ensure that activation functions can produce non-zero outputs, enhancing the network's ability to activate and learn effectively.</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Hidden layers</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Situated between the input layers and output layers, hidden layers perform the bulk of computations within a neural network. They’re called "hidden" because unlike the input and output, they don’t interact with the external environment. The complexity and capability of a neural network are largely determined by the number and architecture of hidden layers.</p>
  <ol start="6">
    <li>Output layer</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This is the final layer in a neural network. It presents the results, transforming the information from the hidden layers into a format that solves the task at hand, such as classification, regression, or any other type of prediction.</p>
  <ol start="7">
    <li>Loss function</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The loss function, or cost function, quantifies the difference between the predicted outputs and actual outputs. Minimizing this function is the goal of training, enabling the model to predict more accurately.</p>
  <ol start="8">
    <li>Optimization algorithms</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These algorithms fine-tune the model to improve its accuracy over time. They tweak the weights and biases to reduce errors during predictions. Some popular methods include stochastic gradient descent, Adam, and RMSprop.</p>
  <ol start="9">
    <li>Backpropagation</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This deep learning algorithm is crucial because it helps the model learn and improve from its mistakes. It figures out how changes to the model's weights affect its accuracy. Then, it adjusts these settings by tracing errors backward through the model to make it better at making predictions.</p>
  <ol start="10">
    <li>Regularization techniques</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Models often learn the training data too closely, causing them to not perform as well on new data (known as overfitting). To adjust for this, techniques like L1 and L2 regularization and batch normalization are used to fine-tune the size of weights and speed up the training process.</p>
  <ol start="11">
    <li>Batch normalization</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This technique normalizes the inputs of each layer, aiming to improve the stability, performance, and speed of the neural network. It also helps in reducing the sensitivity to the initial starting weights.</p>
  <ol start="12">
    <li>Dropout</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Another regularization method, dropout randomly ignores a set of neurons during training. This helps to reduce overfitting by preventing the network from becoming too dependent on any single neuron.</p>
  <h2 id="common-applications-of-deep-learning">Common applications of deep learning</h2>
  <p>Deep machine learning has come a long way since the Perceptron. Instead of needing to install room-sized machines, organizations can now create <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/data-intelligence/features/machine-learning.html">deep learning solutions on the cloud</a>. The ability of today’s deep neural networks to handle complex datasets make them valuable tools across diverse sectors, opening new avenues for innovation that were once considered futuristic.</p>

  <h2 id="deep-learning-vs-machine-learning-vs-ai">Deep learning vs. machine learning vs. AI</h2>
  <p>There are some key differences between traditional machine learning and deep learning:</p>
  <p>Machine learning relies on humans to manually identify and select the features or characteristics of the data that are important for a task, such as edges in images or specific words in text. This process of training requires a lot of expertise and effort.</p>
  <p>Deep learning enables machines to automatically determine which features of the data are most important for performing specific tasks. This is done by processing the raw data, such as pixels in an image, through multiple layers of a neural network. Each layer transforms the data into a more abstract form, building on the previous layer's output. As the model is exposed to more data, it continuously refines these transformations to improve accuracy and performance, becoming more effective over time.</p>
  <h3 id="ai-vs-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning-example">AI vs. deep learning vs. machine learning example</h3>
  <p>If you’re unsure of the differences between AI, machine learning, and deep learning, you’re not alone. Here’s a real-world AI vs. deep learning vs. machine learning example about self-driving vehicles:</p>
  <p>AI is the overarching technology used to give self-driving vehicles human-like intelligence and autonomy. It includes machine learning and deep learning.</p>
  <p>Machine learning is the subtype of AI that allows self-driving systems to learn and improve from data without being specifically programmed for every scenario.</p>
  <p>Deep learning is the specialized subtype of machine learning that processes and interprets the complex inputs, including visual data from cameras, making sense of the environment in real-time.</p>
  <h3 id="deep-learning-vs-deep-learning-models">Deep learning vs. deep learning models</h3>
  <p>It’s also not uncommon to see the terms “deep learning” and “deep learning models” used interchangeably, but there’s a nuanced difference between them:</p>
  <p>Deep learning refers to the entire field of study. It encompasses the theories, techniques, algorithms, and processes used to train artificial neural networks.</p>
  <p>Deep learning models refer to the specific neural networks that have been designed and trained to solve a particular problem or perform a specific task. Each model is unique, tailored to its specific data, training, and task. A model's performance depends upon:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How well it’s been trained, including the quality and quantity of the data, and its learning rate.</li>
    <li>The design and computational power of the computer infrastructure it runs on.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="what-are-deep-neural-networks">What are deep neural networks?</h2>
  <p>Deep learning networks, often called deep neural networks, learn complex patterns in large datasets by adjusting neural connections through training. There are several major types: artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-generative-ai.html">generative neural networks,</a> and autoencoders.</p>

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <div class="accordion">
    <div>
      <div data-valign="middle">What is deep learning in simple words?</div>
      <div data-valign="middle">Deep learning, sometimes also called deep machine learning, is a type of artificial intelligence that teaches computers to learn by example, much like humans do. It uses a layered structure of algorithms called neural networks to process data, recognize patterns, and make decisions.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div data-valign="middle">What is an example of deep learning?</div>
      <div data-valign="middle">A notable example of deep learning is in medical imaging, where algorithms analyze images like X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans to detect diseases such as cancer. By training on vast datasets of medical images, these deep learning systems can identify subtle patterns that might be missed by human eyes, assisting doctors in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div data-valign="middle">What are three types of deep learning?</div>
      <div data-valign="middle">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Convolutional neural networks:</strong> A familiar example is the face unlock feature on smartphones. Convolutional neural networks analyze the facial features from the camera input to verify the user’s identity, allowing secure and quick access to the device. This process involves the network learning from various images to accurately recognize and confirm the user’s face.</li>
          <li><strong>Recurrent neural networks:</strong> Ideal for tasks involving sequences, such as predicting the next word in a sentence. This makes them great for applications like predictive text on your smartphone, where the network learns from the sequence of your typing to suggest the next word you might type.</li>
          <li><strong>Autoencoders:</strong> A practical example is image compression, where autoencoders reduce the size of images for storage or transmission and then restore them to their original quality when needed. This process helps in reducing the space needed to store images while maintaining their quality.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div data-valign="middle">What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?</div>
      <div data-valign="middle">Machine learning refers to the broader concept of computers learning from data to make decisions or predictions. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many, or “deep,” layers. The main difference is the depth of learning; deep learning automatically discovers the most relevant data to be used for learning, but machine learning requires the data to be specified manually. Additionally, deep learning performs better with larger datasets, while traditional machine learning can be more effective with smaller datasets.</div>

  <h2 id="enterprise-ai-strategy-and-planning">Enterprise AI strategy and planning</h2>
  <p>Becoming an AI enterprise involves more than just selecting the right platform or product—it also involves smart planning and teamwork. Businesses get the most value from their AI investments when they set clear objectives, encourage cross-team collaboration, and commit to ongoing learning. Here are some key considerations when getting started:</p>
  <h3 id="in-house-vs-partner-led-implementation">In-house vs. partner-led implementation</h3>
  <p>An important early step is deciding whether to plan and implement an enterprise AI platform or solution using in-house resources or to hire an expert partner.</p>
  <p><strong>In-house implementation</strong></p>
  <p>Implementing enterprise AI solutions without the help of an external partner can be cost-effective if the organization has the necessary technical expertise, resources, and bandwidth. This also offers advantages like total control over project execution and confidentiality of sensitive information. However, in-house implementations may pose challenges for some organizations, including a steep learning curve and substantial investment of employees’ time.</p>
  <p><strong>Partner implementation</strong></p>
  <p>While initially costly, hiring an <a href="https://www.sap.com/partners/find.html">enterprise AI partner</a> provides businesses with specialized knowledge, resources, and experience. It allows organizations to confidently implement their solution knowing they’re following industry best practices. Working with a partner can also help mitigate skills gaps, and generally accelerates the process. Partner-led implementations require careful selection of vendors who align with the organization's objectives and culture.</p>
  <h3 id="assessment-and-goal-setting">Assessment and goal setting</h3>
  <p>It’s critical to assess existing capabilities and set clear goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goal alignment:</strong> Define specific, measurable goals that the AI solution should meet. These goals should align with broader business objectives and have clear metrics for success. For instance, if reducing operational costs is a priority, set a target percentage reduction as a goal for AI initiatives.</li>
    <li><strong>Data audit:</strong> Perform a robust audit of data to evaluate quality, accessibility, and security. This assessment will be crucial to identify blockers and areas that need to be improved before the technical implementation begins.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="resource-allocation">Resource allocation</h3>
  <p>Assessing budgetary and human capabilities are vital to success:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Budgeting:</strong> Allocate adequate financial resources not just for the acquisition of enterprise AI technology but also for ongoing expenses like software updates, cloud storage, and cybersecurity measures.</li>
    <li><strong>Talent acquisition:</strong> Hiring skilled personnel or training existing employees to handle new AI tools is imperative. The technological investment will only work as planned if the people using it have the right skills.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
  <p>Business AI projects are most successful when everyone benefiting from them participates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cross-functional teams:</strong> Form teams that include members from IT, data analytics, leadership, and end-users. This inclusive strategy helps ensure that all potential impacts and benefits are considered from the outset.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular reviews:</strong> Set up regular review sessions to evaluate the progress of AI integration against the project goals. These reviews can help realign efforts with business objectives and adapt to new challenges or opportunities.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="adaptation-and-learning">Adaptation and learning</h3>
  <p>As enterprise AI continues evolves, businesses need to expect that their strategies and practices around using it need to evolve, too:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Continuous training:</strong> Develop ongoing training programs for employees to keep up with AI advancements helps staff stay informed and confident in their abilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback mechanism:</strong> Establish mechanisms to collect feedback on AI implementations from all stakeholders. This feedback is invaluable for refining AI strategies and tools, helping to ensure they remain effective and aligned with user needs over time.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="conclusion-how-enterprise-ai-is-redefining-business">Conclusion: How enterprise AI is redefining business</h2>
  <p>Enterprise AI – including well-established types like machine learning and newer types like copilots and generative AI – are transforming businesses by enhancing their productivity, decision-making, and innovation. The positive results experienced by early adopters of business AI indicate that AI tools for business are not just a passing trend, but a necessity for remaining competitive in the digital world.</p>
  <p>However, becoming a successful AI enterprise isn’t just about choosing the right enterprise AI platform. It’s also necessary to foster a workplace culture that thrives with AI. This involves training, data security investments, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-responsible-AI.html">using AI responsibly</a>.</p>

      <div>Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently forcing the technology industry to undergo <a href="">a paradigm shift</a>, further accelerating the upheaval in business and society. We see AI embedded in tools we have been using for years, and we see software finding its way into every aspect of competition today. Against this background, it comes as no surprise that <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/state-of-ai-2022.html">94% of business leaders see AI as critical to success over the next five years</a>.

  <p>To make it easier to develop relevant skills and secure business success in such a volatile environment, <a href="/2022/11/sap-coursera-partnership-digital-skills-underrepresented-groups">we embarked on a journey to upskill millions of people worldwide</a> in search of opportunity. After launching a digital skills initiative for those underserved in tech, forging new partnerships, offering the first role-based certifications to help meet real-life business needs, and making future-focused learning resources available to all, we are now taking our efforts to an even higher level – with more free, self-paced learning and engagement opportunities, new solution demos to experience the latest innovations in SAP Business AI, cloud ERP, and SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), among others, a full portfolio of role-based certifications and a new certification model, as well as an extended digital skills initiative.</p>
  <h2 id="more-than-250-free-online-courses-now-available-for-all">More Than 250 Free Online Courses Now Available for All</h2>
  <p>From global talent shortages and changing job profiles to the digitalization of entire economies, many organizations see the gaps between skill supply and demand grow wider and wider while searching for ways to adapt to a business landscape where advancements like AI, machine learning, and a new era of Big Data come into play. In this ever-changing atmosphere, tens of thousands of organizations have <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company.html">deployed SAP solutions</a> to support them on their path to bring out their best, leading to skyrocketing demand for SAP talent.</p>
  <p>To help meet the increasing demand, we recently launched more than 50 new free, self-paced learning journeys – many of them touching on AI features embedded in our software – bringing the total number of digital courses on the <a href="https://learning.sap.com/?url_id=text-sapnewscenter-prdteng-Sapphire">SAP Learning site</a> to more than 250. By allowing everyone with an Internet connection to quickly learn a new skill for free, keep up with the latest innovations, and prepare for an in-demand SAP Certification, more professionals can advance in the competitive technology labor market, while customers can draw on a deeper bench of skills to accelerate digital transformation.</p>
  <h2 id="launching-role-based-certifications-for-all-key-roles">Launching Role-Based Certifications for All Key Roles</h2>
  <p>As organizations need to be more adaptive and dynamic, traditional university degrees become less important and skills-based hiring is on the rise when trying to fill positions. In fact, recent reports show that up to <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/02/27/educational-requirements-job-postings/">52% of job postings</a> in the U.S. in the beginning of the year did not state an educational requirement. Instead, role-based certifications and practical experience have become more determining factors for career paths and hiring.</p>
  <p>Recognizing the advantages role-based certifications can offer both individuals and organizations, we have further enhanced our certification program to better align with real-life business needs, now offering role-based certification for all key roles, including consultants, analysts, and architects. These role-based certifications come with a clear career path for individuals. Together with a <a href="https://learning.sap.com/get-certified?url_id=text-sapnewscenter-prdteng-Sapphire">new model to get and stay certified</a> with continuous assessments, this is our way to help ensure skill sets are sharp, focused on core competencies, and more sustainable and valid for longer periods of time.</p>
  <p>With these enhancements, we believe we have now taken an important next step to support professionals and organizations in the SAP ecosystem to bring out their best with ongoing and up-to-date knowledge of the latest skills, helping to maximize the ROI of SAP software, shorten deployment times, lower costs, speed innovation, and increase employee retention and satisfaction.</p>
  <h2 id="simplified-access-to-pre-trained-sap-talent">Simplified Access to Pre-Trained SAP Talent</h2>
  <p>However, we recognize that many people considered underrepresented in tech still do not have access to future-focused educational resources and with it, fulfilling careers. Launched in late 2022, <a href="https://learning.sap.com/digital-skills?url_id=text-sapnewscenter-prdteng-Sapphire">SAP’s digital skills initiative</a> was intended to equip 10,000 people from underrepresented and underserved groups for a career in the tech industry with free, self-paced learning resources and a free certification exam attempt to obtain an in-demand SAP Certification to show their expertise. Ever since its launch, the initiative has grown – and contributed to <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/learner-stories/bg-p/learner-stories">amazing success stories</a>.</p>
  <p>Hearing that SAP professionals like <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-learning-blog-posts/breaking-barriers-and-fighting-sexism-lin-s-journey-from-a-salesgirl-to-an/ba-p/13588835">Lin Fan, a Chinese immigrant to Germany</a>, could overcome gender bias because of our digital skills initiative, makes me proud. “[The digital skills initiative and SAP Certification] indeed opened new doors and helped me get noticed by recruiters,” Fan said. “I got several interviews from major SAP consulting firms shortly after handing in my application. In the interviews, I highlighted what I learned and expressed my confidence in accepting challenges for rolling out SAP S/4HANA. In the end, I got an offer and gladly started a junior role at a consulting firm that actively implements SAP S/4HANA projects.”</p>
  <p>While Fan’s path is inspiring, she is not the only one who turned their life around with the help of SAP. Given the expectation-exceeding demand of now more than 14,500 candidates, we are overwhelmed by the positive uptake of the initiative. One of our recent graduates, <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/learner-stories/breaking-down-barriers-hear-from-chelcie-scott-how-she-broke-into-tech-with/ba-p/13710541">Chelcie Scott, agreed to tell her story</a> on camera and shared how intimidating the tech industry appeared to the single mother at first. Thanks to her willpower and commitment, plus a little help from the digital skills initiative, she recently got certified and hired by an SAP partner. And as organizations are still struggling to find skilled employees, we have decided to extend SAP’s digital skills initiative, bringing candidates and organizations together. With simplified access to SAP-trained talent, we are helping customers and partners to recruit talent and expand their workforce faster while also allowing for greater diversity and innovation.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we recognize the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for customers, partners, and individual learners within and outside of the SAP ecosystem. With these enhancements, we have taken the next step to help organizations equip their existing workforce with the right tools and resources to future-proof their skill set while also paving career growth for those who do not have a seat at the table yet but can bring a fresh set of perspectives to it.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>This week at SAP Sapphire, four industry-leading companies joined SAP Executive Board Members Scott Russell and Thomas Saueressig on stage in Orlando to discuss how they are using SAP technology to deliver high-value results for their businesses.</div>

  <p>Russell told the crowd that customer stories and conversations is what SAP Sapphire is all about, saying that what makes the event special is having “a collective group that comes together, both here in the room and virtually, and being able to understand how SAP can bring out your best.”</p>
  <p>Russell emphasized that the news from SAP Sapphire is a “demonstration of our commitment to continually innovate, to continually strive to bring more creative value to your business.”</p>
  <p>He noted that a perfect example of this is the announcement that <a href="/2024/06/sap-enters-agreement-to-acquire-walkme">SAP has entered into an agreement to acquire WalkMe</a>, a leader in digital adoption platforms. Reflecting on the acquisition, Russell said “We are obsessed not only about great applications and great platforms to deliver value for your business, we also care passionately about the transformation journey to get there.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZZ1yFoALzAs?si=mbPWUzgttHga-_PR">Embed from www.youtube.com</a></p>
  <p>As Chief Revenue Officer, Russell noted that every day 300 million people log on to SAP cloud applications to run their businesses. “And obviously we can never take that for granted,” he said. “You have choice, you have options. We strive to be at our best to help you be at yours. The way we measure success is in your terms, because ultimately [as a] market leader in business AI, we hold ourselves to the highest standards. Why? Because that’s what you expect.”</p>
  <p>A big part of the transformation journey many customers are taking is moving to the cloud with RISE with SAP. “We are super proud of our cloud journey and [that] we are helping you transform your business,” Russell said. “More than 6,000 customers have already moved to RISE with SAP. Of those 6,000 customers in the last 12 months, over 1,000 have already gone live.”</p>
  <h2 id="puretech-scientific-speed-and-scalability-is-key">PureTech Scientific: Speed and Scalability is Key</h2>
  <p>Russell was first joined on stage by Brian Hardee, CIO of <a href="https://www.puretechscientific.com/">PureTech Scientific LLC</a>, a global leader in the production of glycolic acid used in a variety of industries and applications. As a recent carve-out by a private equity owner from a much larger global manufacturer, PureTech had to quickly migrate its operations to its own systems. But without an IT team of its own this was initially a daunting challenge. The new company chose SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition because of its many benefits.</p>
  <p>“For us, it was an easy choice because first, we have no IT team,” Hardee said. “We have no internal training team, and we also had a very tight timeline with respect to the exit. So, we needed a solution that would enable us to move forward with speed, efficiency, and scalability. I could be confident that the infrastructure was being managed and secure. And that left us with an awesome choice for growth as well.”</p>
  <p>Scalability and rapid implementation were key factors in the choice of GROW with SAP, Hardee noted: “It was a great fit and gave us a platform for scalability for future bolt-ons, acquisitions, and so forth. So that’s the main reason. And SAP has an awesome suite of tools that enable that rapid implementation. And there was no other way we were going to do it without an internal IT team and without the access to the training material and the testing and so on.”</p>
  <p>And speaking of rapid implementation, PureTech went live on SAP in just 15 weeks, standardizing a business with an 85-year history on a common platform. Hardee gave some advice on how to make a project successful: “Use the tool set that SAP provides – SAP Activate methodology does work! And if you have the opportunity, sign up for the SAP Preferred Success program because it gives you a direct line to someone in SAP so that if you or your integrator doesn’t know the answer, SAP can point you to the right direction very quickly. So that helps with the speed of transformation.”</p>
  <h2 id="tropicana-brands-group-all-about-agility-and-time">Tropicana Brands Group: All About Agility and Time</h2>
  <p>Tropicana is a household name to many consumers, known chiefly for its juice and other beverage products. But while the brand is more than 75 years old, <a href="https://www.tropicanabrandsgroup.com/">Tropicana Brands Group</a> is just a bit over two years old, having been recently spun-off as a stand-alone group.</p>
  <p>Jeff Lischett, CIO of the US$3 billion organization, joined Russell to talk about how his company relied on RISE with SAP to make its “Project Harvest” IT separation and transformation project successful.</p>
  <p>Lischett noted that speed and agility was the key value proposition for the project. “We needed a platform that was able to accelerate, move with us, pivot with us, as we were going through this in a very accelerated timeline,” he said. “When you bring the technology and couple it with the unified business architecture powered by SAP, the choice for us was clearly RISE with SAP. Tropicana really needed a fit for purpose. Where we came from was going to be entirely different than where we were going, and this modern ERP, in terms of leaner, simpler, more streamlined ways of working, was really at the core of what we needed across the value chain.”</p>
  <p>Tropicana Brands Group took its European business operations live on SAP just 11 months after it started the design work, followed by North America three months later. “That was pressure testing!” Lischett said. “In just over a year, we had a fully implemented, end-to-end digital core and technology foundation for Tropicana Brands. We have a technology and a platform now that is really going to – no pun intended – rise to meet the challenge of our growth ambition.”</p>
  <p>“Ruthless prioritization” and change management were key to the project’s success, Lischett said. “I’m the biggest evangelist and advocate of change management,” he said. “You need it. You need it at the front, you need it during, you need it at the end. One thing that I would’ve probably done slightly differently is [to have] stayed with it longer at the end.”</p>
  <p>Tropicana is already seeing the impact of the project and specifically its focus on a clean core. “The most impactful value we’ve seen [goes] back to that clean core,” Lischett said. “Just in the months that followed, the ability to … bring the development forward, to build on top of the core that we have with enhancements and optimizing at a speed ratio that you just haven’t seen.”</p>
  <p>When asked about what role AI will play in his company, Lischett focused mainly on the human side of the technology. “Ironically, from the standpoint of being a technologist … AI in my mind, in terms of how I lead it, [needs to be] human-centered first and foremost, ensuring that we’ve got the right culture, responsible use, and effective use,” he said. “The gift of time is really the value creator that I see in AI and being able to work more efficiently and being able to take that time and translate it into what matters to you.”</p>
  <h2 id="responsibly-enabling-critical-systems">Responsibly Enabling Critical Systems</h2>
  <p>Russell handed over the stage to Saueressig, who recently launched the <a href="/2024/04/cloud-transformation-adoption-revolution-expectations-outcomes-meet">new Customer Services &#x26; Delivery Board area</a>. Saueressig noted that 25% of the world’s commerce already runs through more than 6,000 RISE with SAP customers worldwide, and that SAP supports the most critical business processes on the planet.</p>

  <p>With that comes “the responsibility and the accountability to provide you with the most reliable and secure infrastructure,” Saueressig said. “That’s the reason why we co-engineered together with our partners from AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many others, to ensure that you have the highest level of quality and availability.”</p>
  <p>Echoing the theme of speed and adaptability, he noted that fast adoption of technology is critical. “Today, it’s not about the big fish that eats the small fish, it’s about the fast fish that eats the slow,” he cited. “At the end of the day, [our] ambition is to transform your system landscape to create a more flexible architecture, which enables fast adoption of innovations and ultimately, value realization. … And we take our responsibility seriously to really help you thrive in this ever-changing environment.”</p>
  <h2 id="fresenius-se-from-complexity-to-standardization">Fresenius SE: From Complexity to Standardization</h2>
  <p>Ingo Elfering, CIO of global healthcare conglomerate <a href="https://www.fresenius.com/">Fresenius</a>, knows something about speed: his team migrated 29 system landscapes containing more than 134 systems in less than 15 months. He joined Saueressig on stage to provide some insights into his company’s transformation project.</p>
  <p>As a company that has grown through many acquisitions, Fresenius had a highly heterogenous IT landscape. “We never quite integrated them,” Elfering said. “So, a really complex landscape …, [with] all sorts of interfaces and other applications attached to it. That was our starting point.”</p>
  <p>Fresenius’ management realized the company needed to change and become more efficient and effective to set itself up for ongoing success. It went all-in, doing four major transformations at the same time. As Elfering noted, “We not only did the RISE with SAP migration, we also did a complete cloud migration of our data centers worldwide; an outsourcing with a partner to become a more global team; and a global change of our network, including a whole bunch of security additions into our space.”</p>
  <p>Since it works in the healthcare and pharmaceutical space, Fresenius has a lot of regulatory requirements that it must adhere to, making the project more challenging than it might be in other industries. “You do a lot more technical documentation, testing, and so forth. So, from that perspective, regulations like GxP, good manufacturing or critical infrastructure, they were new to SAP in that instance in RISE with SAP. And we did it together. And I find that quite remarkable.”</p>
  <p>The <a href="/2023/06/fresenius-rise-with-sap-moves-sap-systems-cloud">new system has now been live</a> for just over a year and the company has seen many benefits. “We have a better speed on the underlying systems,” Elfering said. “We have a new infrastructure stack that works well. The main benefit for us will come as we [reinvent] the company. … We have some systems that doubled and tripled in size. So, it’s possible to leverage SAP quite quickly in these types of environments. From that perspective, I’m very happy with where we are. … We now have all the foundations in place to be able to execute our next phase of changes, our consolidation, our simplification, and in the cloud.”</p>
  <p>Finally, Elfering believes that healthcare is an area where AI can make a significant difference. “Healthcare always has been data-rich and insights-poor. … And the only way to get there, in our opinion at least, is to be on a cloud-based infrastructure in the first place. Because otherwise you don’t have the same performance or capabilities.”</p>
  <h2 id="clean-core-drives-agility">Clean Core Drives Agility</h2>
  <p>The idea of a “clean core” and a unified, simplified system underlies all these customer transformation stories. And it’s even more important in the context of agility and adaptability when it comes to taking advantage of the latest innovations in AI.</p>
  <p>“It’s super important for us to be clear that the clean core is not just for the sake of the clean core,” Saueressig said. “It’s a means to get to an innovation- and upgrade-ready system to be able to embrace these innovations. Because at the end of the day, legacy systems often have this technical depth that limits agility.”</p>
  <p>Saueressig admitted that even SAP has struggled with this, noting that the company had millions of lines of custom code in its systems. An internal analysis of all SAP customers showed that more than 65% of their custom code was unused in the past 12 months. “Code is also a liability, not just an asset,” he said. “And this is something we need to actively work against.”</p>
  <h2 id="hitachi-high-tech-corporation-clean-and-simple-benefits">Hitachi High-Tech Corporation: Clean and Simple Benefits</h2>
  <p>Saueressig invited Takuya Sakai, general manager of the Digital Transformation Business Group at <a href="https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/">Hitachi High-Tech</a>, on the stage to talk more about the benefits of system simplification and clean core. In 2019, Hitachi High-Tech <a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/07/d237f8b9-7e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">initiated a project</a> to simplify its business processes and digitize its management information. With its existing business processes fragmented across overseas sales offices, headquarters, and manufacturing sites, the organization needed to change to accelerate its business and set itself up for future growth. It chose SAP S/4HANA to help it build its new foundation for ongoing growth.</p>
  <p>Hitachi was running SAP R/3 but had significantly customized it with 9,000 add-ons across four instances, resulting in a lot of custom code. This resulted in many errors every day and large operational costs every year, Sakai said. And with the cost of validating so many add-ons, the company only did a major version update once in 12 years.</p>
  <p>To move to a more standardized and flexible system, Hitachi High-Tech adopted a two-tier architecture model. Taking advantage of development flexibility, the company deployed SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition for its headquarters and group companies in Japan and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition for its overseas sales offices. The adoption of SAP S/4HANA Cloud allows Hitachi High-Tech to take advantage of the functionality offered by SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) for application development, data management, automation, integration, analytics, and AI.</p>
  <p>With the new system, Hitachi High-Tech reduced its 9,000 add-ons to just 750, allowing it to easily upgrade its ERP core. “Upgrading our old ERP took about a year and a half from the planning stage,” Sakai said. “However, with clean core, we can now do an upgrade every year in about 40 days. An upgrade every year keeps the clean core fresh and means new features can be delivered to our business quickly, like AI or process automation.”</p>
  <p>But achieving – and keeping – a clean core “requires patience,” Sakai said. Executives must understand the purpose of the transformation project and employees must overcome the pain that comes with a transformation project. “This is the most difficult thing,” he said. “The IT department must properly understand the new technology and suggest how to use it correctly. Then together we embark on the journey to the transformation.”</p>
  <h2 id="supporting-business-transformation-and-accelerating-time-to-value">Supporting Business Transformation and Accelerating Time to Value</h2>
  <p>Accelerating and improving time-to-value for customers is very important to SAP, according to Saueressig.</p>
  <p>“We are now bringing together all of our assets … in a seamless, end-to-end tool chain,” he said. “We want to holistically support your business transformation according to the dimensions of applications, data, processes, and people, which means we bring together and fully integrate SAP LeanIX for the IT landscapes and architecture, SAP Signavio for process management, SAP Cloud Application Lifecycle Management for application management and operational aspects, SAP BTP for integrations, and SAP Build for extensions, but also our telemetry tools, which we can leverage in the cloud.”</p>
  <p>Saueressig’s passion and ambition is to help customers drive innovation adoption. He noted that RISE with SAP is more than just a technical migration: it’s an offering for holistic business transformation as a service to accelerate value realization.</p>
  <p>“Ultimately, we want to help you to bring the best out of our entire holistic portfolio,” he said. “We want to help you to transform, realize agility at scale, achieve more across the entire value chain, and fundamentally transform operations with sustainability at the core. And this is something where I feel that we have a huge opportunity together to make that a reality.”</p>

      <div>In their SAP Sapphire Orlando keynote, Executive Board Members Muhammad Alam, SAP Product Engineering, and Juergen Mueller, chief technology officer, shared how the latest SAP innovations will help businesses drive true, end-to-end digital transformation and address their toughest business challenges.</div>

  </div>
  <p>In the keynote, which featured several real-world product demos by SAP employees, Alam and Mueller touted the value of SAP’s best-of-breed solutions with an outlook of what the next 50 years of innovation by SAP may look like.</p>
  <p>Who better to inspire the keynote than Hasso Plattner, co-founder and recently retired chairman of the SAP Supervisory Board, who both Alam and Mueller invoked during the session. To spell out SAP’s legacy and vision for the future, Mueller quoted <a href="/2024/05/hasso-plattner-olaf-scholz-farewell-tributes">Plattner’s farewell message</a>: “Keep innovating, keep pushing boundaries, and keep making a difference in the lives of our customers and the world at large.”</p>
  <h2 id="keep-innovating">Keep Innovating</h2>
  <p>To kick off his first SAP Sapphire appearance as the head of SAP Product Engineering, Alam began by describing the importance of harnessing innovation to deliver an end-to-end picture across all business functions and unlock true value.</p>
  <p>Simply put, businesses exist to build and deliver products and services to customers, he explained. But the materials, assets, people, and processes that come together to achieve this task is far from simple. “The reality is that each part of the business is deeply and intricately connected to all the others,” Alam said, meaning a pain point in one area impacts the rest. That’s why SAP’s modular cloud ERP approach is so successful: “We allow our customers to drive true digital transformation as opposed to running systems integration projects disguised as digital transformation,” he added.</p>
  <p>Alam presented <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/grow.html">GROW with SAP</a> as an example of this composability and extensibility, as it can work for and scale to many sizes and types of business. And now, SAP Sales Cloud and Concur Expense are natively integrated into GROW with SAP, making the offering even more comprehensive. Sinit Foto, product manager for UX, Cloud ERP at SAP, joined Alam on stage to show how GROW with SAP and SAP Business AI can help achieve integrated processes, demoing use cases such as communicating with customers about sales quotes, creating expense reports, and supporting financial analyses. In fact, Alam announced that SAP is implementing the demoed application internally to manage sales worldwide. And Mueller emphasized: “We are committed to helping you in this transformative AI moment by creating business outcomes that were unthinkable before. That’s why we’re embedding SAP Business AI deeply in our processes and analytics.”</p>

  <h2 id="keep-pushing">Keep Pushing</h2>
  <p>AI was woven throughout the entire keynote, with both Alam and Mueller discussing <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html">SAP’s strategy and product enhancements in this space</a>. AI must be high value, easy to adopt into the flow of work, and trustworthy for it to truly transform how we do business, Alam said. “Equally important is whether it’s done in a way where it keeps your data secure and private – and is executed in a responsible manner,” he added. “And that is really the core promise of SAP Business AI.”</p>
  <p>There’s no doubt that AI is a powerful technology, which is why it’s essential that businesses view it as a “responsibility” not just an “opportunity,” Alam said. Megan Fife, executive solution advisor for SAP SuccessFactors, showed how SAP executes on its responsible, reliable, and relevant business AI by demoing how SAP’s AI copilot Joule in SAP SuccessFactors HCM can help fill skills gaps and collaborate across teams, among other meaningful tasks. Key to this endeavor is <a href="/2024/06/joule-microsoft-copilot-unified-work-experience">SAP’s expanded partnership with Microsoft announced earlier in the day</a>, which Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Cloud and AI at Microsoft, discussed with Alam on stage.</p>
  <p>Mueller echoed the importance of responsible AI, saying that the technology depends highly on data that is reliable and that allows customers to look at their business end-to-end. Here, SAP Datasphere and SAP Spend Control Tower – which was demoed by Orla Cullen, product marketing manager for Data and Analytics at SAP – can help simplify data management and view and manage spend and sustainability data holistically.</p>
  <p>This transformation is supported by <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)</a>, and Mueller demonstrated the newest generative AI features in SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Integration Suite, and SAP Build solutions. He showed how Joule can help create and summarize financial reports for controlling teams; generate integration flows between SAP and non-SAP applications; and create custom skills and content based on specific business needs. Greater insights, faster reaction times, and increased productivity are the result. Soon, Mueller added, it will even be possible to enhance and extend Joule’s knowledge by creating custom skills using SAP Build and having the copilot interact with data housed in SAP and non-SAP systems, helping businesses run even more efficiently.</p>
  <p>SAP BTP is the key to being “innovation-ready,” maintaining a clean core, and tailoring standard offerings to unique needs, Mueller explained. More than 24,000 companies running live on SAP BTP, including Blue Diamond Growers and Lufthansa Technik, can attest to this.</p>
  <p>“SAP BTP’s extensibility and enterprise automation capabilities can help businesses turn process insights into actual improvements,” Mueller said. Cecilia Huergo, product manager for SAP BTP, showed this in her demo on how identifying improvement opportunities, realizing needed changes while maintaining a clean core, and gaining an up-to-date view of your IT landscape can be enabled with the combined power of SAP Signavio solutions, SAP LeanIX,, SAP BTP, and ABAP Cloud.</p>
  <h2 id="keep-making-a-difference">Keep Making a Difference</h2>
  <p>The innovations demoed and discussed in Alam and Mueller’s keynote, in addition to <a href="/2024/06/sap-sapphire-news-business-ai-enterprise-cloud-portfolio-cutting-edge-partnerships">the many others announced at SAP Sapphire in 2024</a>, are just the latest steps forward in SAP’s journey to bringing out the best in its customers. “The future is here, and it’s defined by those who innovate first,” Mueller said. “And we are here to give you the right tools at hand, such that you can be a leader not just today, but also tomorrow.”</p>

        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) and WalkMe Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKME) announced today that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which SAP will acquire WalkMe, a leader in digital adoption platforms (DAPs).</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>WalkMe’s solutions help organizations navigate constant technology change by providing users with advanced guidance and automation features that enable them to execute workflows seamlessly across any number of applications. This results in higher adoption of the underlying application and as such drives value realization.</p>
  <p>The Executive and Supervisory Boards of SAP SE and the board of directors of WalkMe have approved the transaction for US $14.00 per share in an all-cash transaction, representing an equity value of approximately US $1.5 billion. The offer price represents a 45% premium to WalkMe’s closing share price on June 4, 2024.</p>
  <p>The envisioned combination complements SAP’s Business Transformation Management portfolio around SAP Signavio and SAP LeanIX solutions to help customers on their transformation journeys.</p>
  <p>“Applications, processes, data and people are the four key elements of a successful business transformation,” said Christian Klein, CEO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “By acquiring WalkMe, we are doubling down on the support we provide our end users, helping them to quickly adopt new solutions and features to get the maximum value out of their IT investments.”</p>
  <h2 id="walkme-focus-on-analyzing-adoption-and-business-transformation">WalkMe: Focus on Analyzing Adoption and Business Transformation</h2>
  <p>“We are thrilled to join forces with SAP. This acquisition marks a significant milestone in our journey, providing us with the resources and customer base necessary to enhance our product offerings and expand our market reach,” said Dan Adika, CEO of WalkMe. “By leveraging SAP’s extensive ecosystem, we are poised to unlock substantial growth opportunities and deliver even greater value to our customers. Together, we look forward to a future filled with innovation and exceptional service.”</p>
  <p>WalkMe helps organizations boost enterprise productivity and lower risk by enabling consistent, effective and efficient use of software and the workflows it enables. Its DAP works on top of an organization’s application landscape, detects where people encounter friction and provides the tailored support and automation they need to complete the job to be done, right in the flow of work, across any application. Importantly, WalkMe will continue to fully support non-SAP applications.</p>
  <p>Soon, WalkMe will launch the WalkMe<sup>X</sup> copilot, which will use WalkMe’s contextual awareness and AI to suggest the best next step for any workflow, anywhere. WalkMe<sup>X</sup> has the capability to always be on, serving as an overlay to any application, including copilots from different vendors that companies use in their landscapes. Integrating the strength of WalkMe’s adoption capabilities with SAP’s copilot Joule will boost AI assistant and productivity gains for all SAP customers. Additionally, integrating distinctive e-learning features in the SAP Enable Now solution with WalkMe will form the center of SAP’s people-centric transformation approach going forward.</p>
  <p>The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of WalkMe shareholder approval and necessary regulatory clearances, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024. The impact of the transaction on SAP’s non-IFRS earnings per share for fiscal 2024 is expected to be immaterial.</p>

  <p>“This year is a very special Sapphire,” Klein said. “We are entering a new phase of AI, with endless possibilities for us all.”</p>
  <p>Klein and Chief Marketing and Solutions Officer Julia White used the keynote to outline how AI will deliver real business benefits for different corporate functions and “Bring Out Your Best,” this year’s event theme.</p>
  <h2 id="delivering-on-an-ai-promise">Delivering on an AI Promise</h2>
  <p>Klein emphasized how SAP has delivered on its promise to infuse generative AI throughout its business portfolio, has enabled customers to exploit the potential of business AI, and has positioned the Joule copilot as the new front end for SAP applications.</p>

  <p>Together, the two also announced the next evolution and new capabilities in both RISE with SAP and GROW with SAP. Since it was launched over three years ago, more than 6,000 customers have selected RISE with SAP. During his keynote, Klein announced that RISE with SAP will now include a dedicated enterprise architect to guide customers through the RISE with SAP Methodology as well as an integrated tool chain to help manage the process, system, and data landscape holistically across the RISE with SAP life cycle.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile White, broadcasting live from the central showcase on the SAP Sapphire show floor, announced that cloud ERP offering GROW with SAP will now include SAP Sales Cloud and Concur Expense at no additional charge. Whether its managing your finances or managing your expenses, GROW with SAP has you covered, she said.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-momentum">AI Momentum</h2>
  <p>Building on SAP’s business AI momentum, Klein and White also announced a series of expanded partnerships to help companies make the most out of this decisive AI moment. The expanded partnerships include deals with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Klein also announced the integration of Microsoft 365 Copilot with Joule, delivering what he described as a “truly differentiated employee experience.”</p>
  <p>Together onstage with customers and SAP Chief AI Officer Philipp Herzig, they showcased how SAP is infusing generative AI throughout the application portfolio and enabling customers to thrive in the AI era.</p>
  <p>“The business AI innovations we’re announcing will not only change how people work with SAP solutions, but how people work overall,” said Klein ahead of his keynote address.</p>
  <h2 id="new-joule-capabilities">New Joule Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Klein announced Joule for consulting capabilities and Joule for ABAP developer capabilities, which will help SAP’s 6-million-strong consultant and developer community to accelerate projects by 30% and implement SAP solutions faster than ever before.</p>
  <p>During his keynote he described business AI as being “an inflection point” and added, “Today’s AI announcements and partnerships build on our commitment to deliver revolutionary technology that drives real-world results, helping customers unleash the agility and ingenuity they need to succeed in today’s fast-moving business landscape.”</p>

  <p>“SAP is the only tech company who can infuse AI capabilities right into your business processes and workflows,” he said, saluting the achievements of the 40,000 SAP employees in the Product Development organization.</p>
  <h2 id="shout-out-to-sap-developers">Shout Out to SAP Developers</h2>
  <p>“No other tech company can offer a more powerful platform to transform enterprises to rewrite how business is run.” SAP developers have transformed SAP’s portfolio “from an ERP system that enabled transactions in real time, to a system with modular applications and embedded AI so that you can run intelligent, connected, and sustainable enterprises.”</p>
  <p>“We promised this to you, and we delivered,” Klein told audiences online and the 14,000 customers and partners attending SAP Sapphire in person this week in Orlando. “Now we are using the power of generative AI across our stack to once again revolutionize how businesses run and end users will work in the future.”</p>
  <p>After announcing generative AI copilot Joule in September 2023, Klein confirmed that it will become the new front-end and UX for SAP applications and “will turn your words into action.” Joule is ready for prime time, he declared, “and going forward, it will be embedded out of the box for all our cloud customers.”</p>
  <h2 id="joule-key-to-higher-productivity">Joule: Key to Higher Productivity</h2>
  <p>He predicted that Joule will also become the biggest productivity engine for every SAP end user, and that by the end of the year, 80% of the most used tasks will be managed via Joule and the 300 million end users of SAP products will be 20% more productive.</p>
  <p>While AI is a powerful technology facilitating huge opportunities for business and employees, the SAP CEO emphasized that it is also crucial to offer responsible AI. To that end, he announced that SAP is among the first tech companies to adhere to UNESCO’s AI principles.</p>
  <p>Klein wrapped up the keynote by emphasizing that SAP does not view AI as an end in itself, but rather as a tool to help the world run better and improve people’s lives. “You have my commitment that we will continue to listen to your needs, we will continue to deliver great innovations and we will continue to deliver great outcomes for your company.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>Sustainability has evolved from a boardroom buzzword to a critical driver of business success and strategic differentiation. To thrive, companies are going to need to understand how to operate in a modern, low-carbon, circular economy. SAP solutions will support them by embedding sustainability into every aspect of their operations.</div>

        <h3 id="sap-sapphire-taking-business-to-the-next-level-in-the-era-of-ai">SAP Sapphire: Taking Business to the Next Level in the Era of AI</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/events/sapphire/news-guide.html">Read the news guide</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>At our customer flagship event, <a href="/topics/sap-sapphire">SAP Sapphire</a>, we’re discussing how we support customers with their biggest challenges, looking at future trends, and unveiling the latest product innovations.</p>
  <p>This makes the event the perfect opportunity to highlight how we are redefining the way companies manage sustainability through our ERP-centric, cloud-based, AI-enabled approach.</p>
  <h2 id="erp-centric">ERP-Centric</h2>
  <p>For true business model transformation, sustainability needs to be at the core of how companies operate. At SAP, we integrate sustainability data into cloud ERP business processes, which helps companies connect financial and non-financial information and thus treat carbon like money. This makes all decisions financially <em>and</em> environmentally sound while enabling customers to record real impacts and report audit-ready environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics seamlessly.</p>
  <h2 id="cloud-based">Cloud-Based</h2>
  <p>Instant access to fast-evolving innovations is only possible through the cloud. Our modern cloud-based solutions ensure that businesses can quickly adopt new functionality and stay ahead in a rapidly changing environment.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-enabled">AI-Enabled</h2>
  <p>Business AI is revolutionizing the way we approach sustainability. At SAP, AI takes complex sustainability tasks reliant on sustainability data and ERP data and makes them automated and auditable. It enables companies to improve operational efficiency, foster greater transparency around supply chain emissions, design and plan more effectively, and automate time-consuming tasks. SAP Business AI is built on the data and processes that run the business world, including sustainability related information from both inside and outside the company’s walls, making our solutions smarter, faster, and more effective.</p>
  <p>With SAP Business AI, we support our customers’ efforts to optimize for sustainable impact. This year at SAP Sapphire, we are thrilled to announce two new AI-driven sustainability use cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Emission Factor Mapping with AI:</strong> Available in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, this feature enhances the accuracy and speed of carbon footprint calculations through automated, intelligent suggestions. By reducing the manual effort involved in mapping emission factors, businesses can achieve more precise measurements and make informed decisions faster.</li>
    <li><strong>ESG Report Generation with AI:</strong> This capability allows for the automatic generation of ESG reports based on the data within SAP Sustainability Control Tower. This not only streamlines the reporting process but also helps ensure that the data is reliable and actionable, providing a clear picture of a company’s sustainability performance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our comprehensive approach to carbon management is becoming a reality as we introduce new sustainability tracking, monitoring, and reporting features within the SAP cloud ERP portfolio as well as a new solution that will help customers manage sustainability commitments and comply with global regulations.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advanced Carbon Calculator Engine:</strong> This powerful tool featured in SAP Sustainability Control Tower and SAP Sustainability Footprint Management integrates ERP data from SAP S/4HANA Cloud and other sources and embeds results back into business processes for informed decision-making. As such, it allows customers to meet Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standards, offering advanced, granular calculations of both product and corporate carbon footprints.</li>
    <li><strong>SAP Green Ledger</strong> will be released at the end of 2024. The solution will help customers connect their emissions data and financial data, allowing customers to easily understand the correlation between emissions and finances, model sustainable business scenarios, and then act with decisions that are both financially and environmentally sound.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At SAP, we believe that the future of business is inextricably linked to sustainability. This is why sustainability is a key pillar of our growth strategy. Businesses must recognize that sustainable practices are not just ethical choices, but strategic financial decisions that drive innovation, reduce costs, and mitigate risks.</p>
  <p>Moreover, sustainable transformation opens up significant economic opportunities. By transforming their operations around sustainability, businesses can create a modern, low-carbon, circular economy that benefits both the environment and their bottom line, enhancing overall resilience.</p>
  <p>This transformation aligns business success with global sustainability goals, paving the way for a more sustainable, valuable, and prosperous future.</p>

        <p>Together, AWS and SAP are striving to make it easier for customers to adopt the RISE with SAP solution on AWS, to improve the performance and efficiency of SAP workloads running in the cloud and to embed generative AI into an enterprise’s entire portfolio of business-critical applications.</p>
        <p>“AWS was the first cloud provider certified to support the SAP portfolio and today, thousands of enterprise companies run SAP solutions on AWS to get the most out of their mission-critical applications,” said Matt Garman incoming CEO at AWS. “Now, AWS and SAP are making it faster and easier for companies to apply generative AI to their core business data to become more efficient, responsive and sustainable.”</p>
        <p>“Partnerships like this collaboration with AWS are critical as we embed generative AI solutions across our ERP applications so that customers can drive innovation at an accelerated pace,” said Christian Klein, Chief Executive Officer of SAP SE. “In addition to delivering modern cloud ERP to our joint customers, we are excited to support Amazon on their own transformation journey as they adopt RISE with SAP for pioneering areas such as Project Kuiper, Amazon’s satellite initiative intended to increase global broadband access.”</p>
        <h2 id="generative-ai-models-from-amazon-bedrock-available-on-the-generative-ai-hub-in-sap-ai-core">Generative AI Models from Amazon Bedrock Available on the Generative AI Hub in SAP AI Core</h2>
        <p>The generative AI hub in SAP AI Core infrastructure provides customers with secure access to a broad range of large language models (LLMs) that can easily be integrated into SAP business applications. With the integration of generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, SAP customers will be able to access high-performing LLMs and other foundation models (FMs) to build applications customized with their own data. Tens of thousands of customers use Amazon Bedrock to easily, quickly and securely build and scale generative AI applications using FMs from leading AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI and Amazon.</p>
        <p>With this integration, SAP customers may accelerate the adoption of generative AI and modernize key business processes built on SAP solutions. These innovations can be used in embedded use cases within RISE with SAP and the intelligent scenario lifecycle management functionality as an integration component or side-by-side directly on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). SAP and AWS plan to expand the use of Bedrock capabilities in the generative AI hub to further enable embedded AI functionality within SAP’s portfolio of cloud solutions and applications. This includes additional use cases across finance and product lifecycle management.</p>
        <h2 id="sap-to-use-aws-chips-to-train-and-deploy-future-sap-business-ai-offerings">SAP to Use AWS Chips to Train and Deploy Future SAP Business AI Offerings</h2>
        <p>SAP’s use of <a href="/2023/11/sap-hana-cloud-now-supports-aws-graviton">AWS Graviton3 chips to support SAP HANA Cloud</a> helps to deliver performance gains, cost savings and energy efficiency to SAP. By using Graviton3-based Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, SAP has realized up to 30% better compute for analytical workloads and an estimated 45% reduction in carbon footprint for SAP HANA Cloud. Now SAP and AWS are collaborating on the next generation of Graviton4 for SAP HANA Cloud and additional SAP applications to continue to improve performance and efficiency. Based on the success of running SAP HANA Cloud on AWS Graviton, SAP plans to use AWS Graviton to support SAP solutions and applications such as SAP BTP, SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud and the SAP Cloud ALM solution.</p>
        <p>SAP plans to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/">AWS Trainium</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/">AWS Inferentia</a> chips, purpose built for AI and machine learning (ML) workloads, for training and deploying future SAP Business AI offerings. Using Trainium and Inferentia2-based instances in a proof of concept, SAP engineers trained and fine-tuned generative AI LLMs in two days versus 23 days with comparable Amazon EC2 instances. By leveraging Trainium’s specialized architecture designed for efficient ML model training, SAP can accelerate the development process while maintaining high levels of accuracy and reliability.</p>
        <h2 id="increased-performance-for-rise-with-sap-on-aws">Increased Performance for RISE with SAP on AWS</h2>
        <p>Thousands of customers have selected RISE with SAP on AWS to run their largest, most complex, global SAP solution implementations. Now generally available, the next-generation Amazon EC2 High Memory U7i instances offer up to 32TiB of memory in a single instance and provide customers the memory and flexibility they need to support expanding SAP HANA database requirements. Amazon EC2 High Memory U7i instances are the first DDR5 memory-based 8-socket offering by a leading cloud provider to improve the performance of memory-intensive applications such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud as part of RISE with SAP.</p>
        <h2 id="amazons-project-kuiper-selects-rise-with-sap">Amazon’s Project Kuiper Selects RISE with SAP</h2>
        <p>Amazon companies, including Twitch, Zappos.com and Zoox Inc., already use SAP software on AWS to support their operations. And now Project Kuiper—Amazon’s satellite broadband network—is deploying RISE with SAP to support its complex supply chain and manufacturing operations and get the best performance and most value out of its mission-critical SAP software. Running SAP solutions on AWS allows Kuiper to take advantage of the latest SAP capabilities embedded in RISE with SAP to help drive impactful transformation, accelerating company decisions and enhancing overall performance and productivity.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of millions of people lack adequate internet access and Project Kuiper’s goal is to help close the digital divide by delivering fast, affordable broadband to a wide variety of customers operating in places without reliable internet connections. Delivering on that vision requires Kuiper to build satellites at an unprecedented rate. RISE with SAP allows the Project Kuiper team to leverage the most reliable and scalable infrastructure to run a modern, cloud ERP as a managed service, so they can focus on innovation instead of IT management.</p>

        <h1 id="what-is-responsible-ai">What is responsible AI?</h1>
        <p>Responsible AI is the ethical development and use of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on prioritizing fairness, transparency, and human control. Its goal is to prevent harm, avoid biases, and benefit society.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="responsible-ai-definition">Responsible AI definition</h2>
  <p>Responsible AI is the practice of using <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html">AI</a> in a way that emphasizes human oversight and societal well-being. It's about ensuring that AI models, datasets, and applications are developed and deployed ethically and legally, without causing harm or perpetuating biases. It’s important because misusing AI, or using it carelessly, can cause harm to users, society, and businesses.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-responsible-ai-vs-trustworthy-ai-vs-ethical-ai">What is responsible AI vs. trustworthy AI vs. ethical AI?</h2>
  <p>The terms responsible AI, trustworthy AI, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics.html">ethical AI</a> are closely related but there are some key differences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Responsible AI</strong> encompasses the overall ethical implications, governance, oversight, legal, and long-term repercussions of AI.</li>
    <li><strong>Trustworthy AI</strong> refers specifically to the design of AI systems so that they’re reliable, fair, transparent, explainable, and secure.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical AI</strong> focuses on the moral principles of how AI is designed and used so that it doesn’t harm humanity or human dignity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We must always keep in mind that because AI is not human, it’s incapable of having the human traits of responsibility, trustworthiness, or ethics. Therefore, it’s important to attribute these terms to the people who create or use this technology, and not to the technology itself.</p>
  <h2 id="how-responsible-ai-works">How responsible AI works</h2>
  <p>There are human and technology aspects to making responsible AI work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>People</strong> must understand the benefits and risks of using AI – and commit to using it ethically. Individuals and people in organizations and governments all have a role to play.</li>
    <li><strong>AI technology</strong> must be developed, deployed, and governed in ways that prioritize human rights and well-being.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Establishing formalized <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics.html?pdf-asset=940c6047-1c7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff&#x26;page=2">responsible AI principles</a> is a good way to align everyone in an organization to a shared vision of responsible AI. But establishing principles is just a start: the organization must also implement effective AI governance, training, and technical processes to put the principles into action.</p>
  <p>Responsible AI principles vary between organizations. For example, financial services companies might place a higher emphasis on fairness and non-discrimination, while social media companies might focus more on transparency or privacy. Here’s an example of principles summarized from the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai">European Commission’s ethics guidelines</a> for creating trustworthy AI systems:</p>

  </p>
  <h2 id="example-of-responsible-ai-principles">Example of responsible AI principles</h2>
  <p><strong>Human agency and oversight:</strong> AI should augment human decision-making, uphold human rights, and have mechanisms for human oversight.</p>
  <p><strong>Technical robustness and safety:</strong> AI systems should be secure, resilient, safe, accurate, and reliable with a contingency plan to prevent unintentional harm.</p>
  <p><strong>Privacy and data governance:</strong> Systems should fully respect privacy and regulate the quality, privacy, and legitimate access to data.</p>
  <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Systems must be traceable and transparent. They should be clearly marked as AI and their capabilities and limitations should be communicated effectively.</p>
  <p><strong>Diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness:</strong> AI should avoid promoting bias, should support diversity, ensure equal accessibility, and involve stakeholders in the development process.</p>
  <p><strong>Societal and environmental well-being:</strong> AI systems should benefit all human beings, including future generations. They must be sustainable and environmentally friendly, and their societal impact should be carefully considered.</p>
  <p><strong>Accountability:</strong> Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure responsibility and accountability for AI systems and their outcomes. Auditability and accessibility should be ensured.</p>
  <h2 id="responsible-ai-development-practices">Responsible AI development practices</h2>
  <p>Developers and researchers who create or implement AI systems must follow <a href="https://news.sap.com/sea/2024/01/creating-the-next-generation-of-responsible-ai-developers/">trustworthy AI technical best practices</a> and continuously assess their systems’ adherence to their organizations responsible AI principles. Here are some common practices:</p>
  <h4 id="assessing-model-training-data">Assessing model training data</h4>
  <p>Having diverse datasets helps represent various cohorts, improving the robustness and inclusiveness of the AI system. Understanding the data that’s used to train models is necessary for uncovering or mitigating issues like AI bias.</p>
  <h4 id="causal-analysis">Causal analysis</h4>
  <p>Understanding how cause-and-effect relationships work in AI models can aid in ethical decision-making about how deploy them, or if they should even be deployed at all. This analysis makes predictive models more robust by revealing interactions among different variables.</p>
  <h4 id="counterfactuals-analysis">Counterfactuals analysis</h4>
  <p>This is the process of improving model fairness and decision-making by using "what-if" queries to reveal AI biases and logic problems. It works by asking the model how its decisions would change if the input, such as data about a person or situation, had been different.</p>
  <h4 id="fairness-in-machine-learning">Fairness in machine learning</h4>
  <p>Eliminating AI bias is critical to ensuring systems treat different groups or individuals equitably. This is done by identifying unbalanced representation or unfair treatment in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-machine-learning.html">machine learning</a> training data and algorithms, and typically has three phases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-processing of data</strong> to identify and remove biases.</li>
    <li><strong>Applying fairness constraints</strong> during model testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-processing adjustments</strong> to the model’s decision-making.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="model-error-assessment">Model error assessment</h4>
  <p>Evaluating and correcting errors in models’ predictions is critical for avoiding risky or embarrassing outcomes. Common methods for assessing errors include confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve.</p>
  <h4 id="model-interpretability">Model interpretability</h4>
  <p>To promote trust and transparency with users and regulators, developers must be able to interpret and explain why their models make specific decisions and demonstrate certain behaviors. Some commonly used interpretability techniques:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Feature importance</strong> identifies and ranks the most influential variables or “features” used by the model to make predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Partial dependence</strong> plots are graphs that visualize the relationship between a selected variable and a specific outcome, with all other variables being constant.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="why-is-responsible-ai-important">Why is responsible AI important?</h2>
  <p>AI is having a profound impact on society, influencing how we work and interact. Responsible AI can be a catalyst for innovation by encouraging novel, human-first approaches to problem-solving and product development. However, irresponsible AI use poses significant risks, like exacerbating inequalities and generating harmful content.</p>
  <h4 id="ethical-imperatives-for-businesses-and-governments">Ethical imperatives for businesses and governments</h4>
  <p>All organizations and individuals must uphold high ethical standards in their AI usage. Beyond meeting legal requirements, businesses and governments must also prioritize data privacy, transparency, and fairness in their AI endeavors.</p>
  <h4 id="societal-expectations-for-ethical-technology-use">Societal expectations for ethical technology use</h4>
  <p>The demand for accountability and transparency from technology companies is growing as AI becomes more widely used. Society expects AI systems to be engineered to respect human rights, embrace diversity, and prioritize the public good.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>On April 1, 2024, SAP <a href="/2024/04/cloud-transformation-adoption-revolution-expectations-outcomes-meet">formed</a> Customer Services &#x26; Delivery – a new Board area that will focus on maximizing innovation adoption and customer value in the cloud.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is good news – not just for customers but also for the ecosystem. In recent months, SAP had already identified that when engineering teams deliver innovations, there is a corresponding need to provide customers with guidance on how they can swiftly adopt and consume innovation. Customer Services &#x26; Delivery was created to bring together the offerings that help customers tap the value of SAP’s integrated portfolio.</p>
  <p>By virtue of its function, the Customer Support organization fits into this strategic setup quite naturally. To learn more about how Customer Support is owning and driving end-to-end customer support experiences powered by AI, I met with Stefan Steinle, executive vice president and head of Customer Support, SAP SE.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: How would you describe the role of Customer Support in SAP’s success?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Customer support is a differentiating factor among companies that are equally positioned in functional richness, usability, quality, deployability, or configurability. While signing up a new customer is considered a huge win, being able to delight and retain the customer is equally important.</p>
  <p><a href="https://support.sap.com/en/index.html">Support at SAP</a> has been singularly impactful in advancing SAP’s customer success stories by proactively responding to customer needs and building long-term relationships. In addition to helping customers solve day-to-day problems, we are business partners who proactively work with customers toward achieving their business goals.</p>
  <p>The Customer Support group encompasses much more than bug fixes. In addition to regular ticket resolutions, we use SAP Cloud ALM to help guide customers in application lifecycle management by enabling their transformation to the cloud and the operation of hybrid environments. We help customers help themselves through self-services and we proactively consult with our engineering teams to improve SAP products based on support-related feedback and learnings. Thanks to our support engineers, SAP has delivered over 1,000 improvements in the last 12 months.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: How is SAP’s AI story shaping up when it comes to Customer Support? What is the AI strategy for Customer Support?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> With our focus on value realization, the push to enhance support with AI has never been higher. To start with, we have invested in digitalizing mission-critical business processes with AI.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="revolutionize-your-business-with-generative-ai-innovations-from-sap">Revolutionize your business with generative AI innovations from SAP</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There are three parts toward bringing these business processes into the fold of AI-powered offerings. With the help of SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite, we can measure metrics around the customer’s business processes to gauge efficiency, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement. Alternatively, customers can use this as a blueprint to review these metrics themselves. The next layer delivers business transformational AI services. And finally, we have a platform that provides tools to support a closed-loop approach for AI innovation in services and support.</p>
  <p>Coming to the AI strategy for Customer Support, we believe that any innovations in AI must be in lockstep with application integration, meaning AI developments can only bring business value when they are infused and integrated into the applications used in a business process or scenario.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: In the context of Customer Support, could you give some examples of how AI brings business value?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> While the real-world applications are countless, we could broadly classify them into three groups.</p>
  <p>We use AI to correct – this means we use AI for the support experience, for personalization, and for data-driven decisions. We use AI to connect – here you find the platform, tools, and applications along customer touchpoints. We use AI to catalyze – this covers self-service, issue resolutions, and predictive and preventative support.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div><strong>Q: How does SAP realize this?</strong></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> We do this by taking advantage of our AI development platform that can bring all the data of services and support into one place. This platform helps bring endless possibilities based on the unique needs of customers’ businesses. On our part, we ensure that we explore the power of AI across business contexts.</p>
  <p>By building AI models, we have the power to transform business in the way we want. We can plug these models into support systems and portals to extract the full value of AI in support. By collecting data and events from support systems and portals, we can even train AI models that can deliver value later. By processing the context and history of the customer, we can provide highly personalized support experiences – at runtime.</p>
  <p>I could go on, but at this point I would urge you to follow the Customer Support tracks at <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/sapphire.html">SAP Sapphire &#x26; ASUG Annual Conference Orlando on June 3–5, 2024</a>, to learn about the technologies and strategies that are shaping the future of Customer Support and business transformation.

      <div>Over recent years, retailers have experienced a notable shift in consumer behavior towards more sustainable products and conscious consumption. Consumers have driven this shift with their increased awareness of environmental issues, ethical concerns, and desire to support products which are eco-friendly, ethically sourced, and produced under fair labor conditions.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Companies that prioritize <a href="/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a> in their operations, such as using recycled materials, reducing carbon emissions, or supporting social causes, are gaining popularity among consumers. But those consumers demand proof of these values and product promises at the point of sale.</p>
  <p>“The rise of sustainability isn’t just a movement; it is a shift in consumer consciousness,” said Dania Fayyaz, SAP North America sustainability program manager. “Today’s consumers are redefining their purchasing patterns, opting for products and brands that align with their values, and driving a demand for eco-conscious practices and ethical sourcing.” In her conversations with retailers that visited SAP’s booth at NRF 2024, the world’s largest retail fair, she saw a high interest in sustainability solutions.</p>
  <h2 id="consumers--and-markets--demand-visibility">Consumers – and Markets – Demand Visibility</h2>
  <p>When the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) comes into effect for large enterprises later this year all products sold in the EU containing palm oil, cocoa, soy, rubber, cattle/leather, coffee, wood, and their derivatives will need proof that their harvest didn’t contribute to deforestation. Non-compliance will result in potential fines of up to 4% of companies’ EU annual turnover. To help businesses simplify this complex task, the SAP Green Token solution can track the geolocation of where raw materials are harvested and automate the creation of due diligence statements (DDS). The solution can also help improve visibility for consumers on where the raw material for their clothing was sourced and offer information on potential reuse and recycling.</p>

  <p>Take the example of a cotton shirt made from 50% certified recycled materials. Cotton can be sourced from multiple farms or recycling services and taken to a cotton mill where it’s spun into thread and later fabric. It becomes impossible to distinguish the different cotton elements – conventional versus recycled cotton – once they are co-mingled and the manufacturer loses insight into the sustainability attributes of the raw materials. That’s why it’s important to have a sophisticated tracking solution in place. “SAP Green Token can enhance transparency for bulk-traded, co-mingled raw materials by digitally storing sustainability attributes on tokens that traverse the supply chain,” said Fayyaz.</p>
  <p>In addition to making conscious decisions on raw materials and products, consumers can also consider circular economy models. “I’m really intrigued by the idea of revitalizing clothing items,” said Fayyaz. “Imagine being able to exchange a well-loved jacket you’ve had for years and receive credit in return. And the jacket might find a new owner who will genuinely appreciate it.” The SAP Recommerce solution enables that scenario, helping brands and retailers take back, manage, and resell secondhand inventory to help accelerate the shift from linear to circular business models. On an even larger scale, SAP Green Ledger is SAP’s vision to make transactional carbon accounting a reality. It can enable organizations to track carbon like they do cash, with every financial transaction having a corresponding carbon entry. “This is incredibly desirable because we will see taxes for carbon imposed in the future, and decision-makers will want insights into which processes are utilizing the most carbon,” Fayyaz said.</p>
  <h2 id="the-future-of-retail--a-retailers-view">The Future of Retail – A Retailer’s View</h2>
  <p>At a recent SAP event, Christoph Werner, CEO at German retailer dm-drogerie markt, shared his view on the future of retail and his insights on what customers want – and therefore what will shape the way retailers have to engage to drive business.</p>
  <p>For Werner, individualization of the shopping experience and any transaction will play a major role. Therefore, retailers will have to focus on the individual shopper, not on clusters of shoppers like in the past. Hyper-personalizing the customer experience will improve loyalty; the value for the customer will not only be the price, but increasingly the overall service and experience. This will change the concept of promotions. Werner is convinced that retailers will benefit from giving added benefits and delighting the customer, rather than pushing products into the market based on reduced prices. “Bring home flowers every now and then, but keep it special,” Werner said.</p>
  <p>To no surprise, AI will be the foundation for personalized shopping experiences. “AI has benefits and downsides and today it remains to be seen where it will take us,” Werner stated. Overall, retailers see AI as an opportunity, with the technology completing repeatable tasks, freeing up employees for more value-adding tasks, and empowering individuals to make a difference. As retail stores often face staffing challenges, this can empower people in sales and marketing teams instead of replacing them. From Werner’s perspective, an AI-empowered workplace will attract new employees.</p>

  <h2 id="a-glance-into-the-crystal-ball">A Glance into the Crystal Ball</h2>
  <p>At the same time, low-price online platforms continue to attract consumers with their affordable and wide range of products. They offer competitive prices on trendy clothing and accessories using economies of scale and direct-to-consumer models. Despite concerns about their environmental and ethical practices, these platforms remain popular among price-conscious consumers. However, there is growing awareness of the environmental and social impacts of fast fashion and low-price models. As a result, consumers are becoming increasingly discerning in their purchasing decisions, prioritizing quality, longevity, and sustainability over cheap prices and fast fashion trends.</p>
  <p>“Overall, the consumer landscape is evolving, with a growing emphasis on sustainability, conscious consumption, and ethical practices,” said Sven Denecken, chief marketing and solutions officer for SAP Industries &#x26; CX. “Companies that can adapt to these changing preferences and demonstrate a commitment to environmental and social responsibility are likely to thrive in the long term.”</p>
