      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>As a pioneer of spend management software, SAP has been on the cutting edge of how to best comprehensively manage company spend and supplier relationships.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Like at home, identifying every dollar you spend and getting the most out of it is more critical than ever for your business. And as we continue to roll out SAP Business AI technology, the teams behind SAP solutions are working on ways to help you reduce the time spent on mundane tasks so you can focus on executing your strategy, unlocking spend potential, and unleashing efficiency.</p>
  <p>The first quarter of 2024 was among the most productive in my 18 years at SAP. We debuted new AI capabilities in various SAP spend management solutions. Check out some of these highlights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SAP Ariba Category Management</strong>: We’ve incorporated <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/spend-management-blogs-by-sap/generative-ai-powered-content-recommendations-in-sap-ariba-category/ba-p/13640447?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">generative AI-enabled features</a> that can assist category managers by generating recommendations in the solution’s category segmentation, market dynamics, and cost structure tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Scoutbee Discovery</strong>: SAP partnered with Scoutbee, a leading AI-powered supplier intelligence and discovery platform, to launch <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-2001012892_live_v1/scoutbee-discovery?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">Scoutbee Discovery</a>. This SAP endorsed app can rapidly identify qualified suppliers that meet specific criteria and can help advance strategic business imperatives. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/7176993552332140544/comments/">Watch the recording</a> of me participating in a recent LinkedIn Live with the Scoutbee team.</li>
    <li><strong>Concur Request:</strong> Now, this service uses generative AI to help provide <a href="https://www.concur.com/blog/article/sap-concur-delivers-enriched-travel-and-expense-experiences-at-fusion-2024?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">intelligent cost estimates</a> for trip planning.</li>
    <li><strong>ExpenseIt</strong>: Users can upload receipt images to the ExpenseIt solution, which taps AI to help <a href="https://www.concur.com/blog/article/sap-concur-delivers-enriched-travel-and-expense-experiences-at-fusion-2024?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">automatically create a new expense</a> with several key fields prepopulated. Plus, ExpenseIt can now itemize hotel folios using generative AI.</li>
    <li><strong>Generative AI search</strong>: A new capability within Concur Support allows SAP Concur customers to type questions in natural language and get quick answers using generative AI, <a href="https://www.concur.com/blog/article/sap-concur-delivers-enriched-travel-and-expense-experiences-at-fusion-2024?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">without submitting a support ticket</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SAP’s market-leading spend and business network solutions are getting even smarter, working to unlock greater value for our customers. We have many resources devoted to spend management and that’s why we continue to deliver innovation in spend management.</p>
  <p>And we are only getting started. By the end of 2024, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">SAP Business Network</a> is planning the following enhancements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Generative AI RFI/RFP responses in SAP Business Network Discovery</strong>: With generative AI-enabled responses for postings in SAP Business Network Discovery, suppliers will be able to respond to RFIs promptly and more accurately, helping to save time and reduce costs associated with manual labor and resource allocation.</li>
    <li><strong>Catalog enrichment using ChatGPT recommendations</strong>: This feature can enable suppliers to generate and improve product descriptions and overall catalog quality based on prompts and keyword recommendations from ChatGPT.</li>
    <li><strong>Intelligent error simplification using generative AI</strong>: This feature uses machine learning and a large language model to interpret and categorize invoice rejection reasons, allowing suppliers to reduce the number of failing invoices, improve rapid invoice submission and payment, and optimize cash flow.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="driving-success-for-our-customers">Driving Success for Our Customers</h2>
  <p>Hearing me spotlight our direct and indirect procurement, external workforce, and travel and expense management solutions is one thing. Seeing them in action is something way more powerful. Here are a few recent customer success stories to take in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>American Eagle Outfitters</strong> (AEO), a leading global specialty retailer offering high-quality on-trend clothing, accessories, and personal care products through its portfolio of brands, needed to evaluate indirect purchasing processes and vendor relationships to maximize efficiency. See how <a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/10/2ed3b1af-917e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.htm?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124l">SAP Business Network for Procurement and SAP Ariba solutions</a> helped simplify processes and deliver compliant purchasing protocols across the company.</li>
    <li>Power provider to over 900,000 electric customers, <strong>Oklahoma Gas &#x26; Electric Company</strong> (OG&#x26;E) faced challenges with the complexity of third-party and cross-department management of contingent workers. After transitioning SAP Fieldglass solutions to internal management, OG&#x26;E <a href="/2024/02/oge-and-brightspeed-manage-employees-contingent-workers">gained the visibility</a> to make more informed financial decisions, like supplier negotiations.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/entries/2024-award.html#winners?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">2024 SAP Innovation Award winner</a> <strong>Vestas Wind Systems</strong>, the world’s largest manufacturer of wind turbines, launched a large-scale quality initiative powered by SAP Business Network to help mitigate product defects in a highly complex supply chain. Now, using SAP Business Network, suppliers complete predefined quality tests and document them before confirming or sending an order. This enables Vestas employees to be warned in advance of any quality issues further up the supply chain, so they can <a href="/2024/02/vestas-powering-quality-in-supply-chain">take corrective action</a>.</li>
    <li>Most <strong>KUKA</strong> employees are based in Germany, where tax regulation is complex and submitting hotel and entertainment expenses is anything but simple. The KUKA team worked together to develop a simple process using SAP Concur solutions, connected to SAP ERP, that allows employees to create hotel and entertainment expenses <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/casestudy/kuka?campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&#x26;source=blog-glo-JCollierQ124">seven times faster</a> with fewer errors and fewer rejected expense reports.</li>
  </ul>

        <p><strong><em>HANNOVER</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced AI advancements in its supply chain solutions that will unleash a transformative wave of productivity, efficiency and precision in manufacturing. AI-driven insights from real-time data will help companies use their own data to make better decisions across supply chains, streamline product development and improve manufacturing efficiency.</p>

  <p>“Businesses today are confronted with challenges ranging from supply chain disruptions and labor shortages to geopolitical uncertainties,” said Muhammad Alam, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, SAP Product Engineering. “SAP recognizes the imperative for agility and intelligence, driving innovation with AI-powered solutions to streamline supply chain and manufacturing processes. Companies can enhance operational efficiency and improve supply chain resiliency while delighting customers with superior service, paving the way for sustained growth and market competitiveness.”</p>
  <p>Accurate and relevant real-time information helps mitigate the impact that supply-chain disruptions have on suppliers, manufacturers and distributors worldwide. SMA Solar Technology AG and other customers have already witnessed the benefits of SAP’s solutions, including an approximately 15% increase in supply chain workforce productivity, a 10% decrease in overall supply chain planning costs and a 10% reduction in inventory carrying costs and stock turnover rate.</p>
  <p>“SMA Solar modernizes its manufacturing execution systems to support sustainable, risk-resilient manufacturing operations with the power of AI-enabled visual inspection in the SAP Digital Manufacturing solution,” said Heiko Kehm, SMA Solar head of IT Order to Cash.</p>
  <p>Sixty-three percent of supply chain executives and 52% of operations executives have an AI strategy linked to business objectives, according to “<a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2024/04/2214aa25-b77e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">The Importance of AI in Supply Chain and Operations</a>,” a global 2024 IDC InfoBrief sponsored by SAP*. Fifty-one percent of the 2,000 survey respondents are embedding AI into supply chain planning business processes and key applications for real-time decision-making. Another 58% are using AI to increase operational efficiency and employee productivity.</p>
  <p><a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blogs-by-sap/ai-powered-supply-chain-solutions-better-decisions-better-outcomes/ba-p/13675845">Key improvements</a> to SAP’s supply chain solutions to support customers’ AI-centric strategy include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimizing decisions across the supply chain with AI-driven insights:</strong> Companies can now leverage higher volumes of machine data and integrate AI-driven visual inspection by computer into their production processes, enabling a remarkable increase in quality through automation.</li>
    <li><strong>Streamlining product development:</strong> Product developers can now use SAP’s AI copilot Joule to gather and enhance new product ideas quickly and effectively using natural language queries. Joule also helps tag product designs with business data, so they visually contextualize business-critical information.</li>
    <li><strong>Detecting equipment anomalies</strong>: Using AI, asset operators can proactively address potential breakdowns based on sensor data collected from smart devices and edge gateways. This new capacity utilizes the cutting-edge Cumulocity IoT platform from Software AG, which is planned to be embedded in the SAP Asset Performance Management application in Q3.</li>
    <li><strong>Improving field response:</strong> Customers can optimize driving routes and allocate job assignments efficiently with integrated real-time traffic data and machine-learning-trained models, which enable the right field service technicians to reach their destinations on time.</li>

      <div>With the gathering pace of headlines touting artificial intelligence in the business press, one could be forgiven for assuming that all facets of the enterprise stand to benefit equally from its application – everything from the electric stapler to the espresso machine to the ergonomic furniture.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But in reality, some functions are much better suited than others to gain from AI. The deeper the reservoir of data associated with an operational process – and the broader the sharing of that data not only within an organization but among its trading partners as well – the greater the potential for AI to bolster collaborative capabilities, instill operational resilience, and unlock exponential value.</p>
  <p>By facilitating the convergence of trading partners’ operational data, cloud-based networks strengthen transparency and foster collaboration across interconnected processes such as procurement, supply chain, logistics, and asset management. The vast troves of data accumulated from these functions – and the insights they reveal – bear significant implications for forecasting demand, planning inventory, sourcing components, procuring labor, maximizing utilization, managing logistics, gauging sustainability, achieving compliance, and securing financing. Yet the sheer volume of such data, sometimes spanning billions or more transactions, can defy human interpretation in the quest to optimize decision-making.</p>
  <p>That’s where artificial intelligence comes in.</p>
  <p>As the world’s largest B2B collaboration platform, <a href="https://www.sap.com/businessnetwork">SAP Business Network</a> facilitates hundreds of millions of transactions per year, capturing a unified, end-to-end view of spend. So prodigious is the cloud-based network’s volume – exceeding US$5.3 trillion in commerce annually, greater than the gross domestic product of every nation except the United States and China – that, through innovations in predictive and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/innovations.html#ai">generative AI</a> technologies, SAP Business Network is transforming procurement, supply chain, logistics, asset management, and related operational processes, with the goal that every business runs as an intelligent, sustainable enterprise.</p>

  <p>The cloud is uniquely fit for the task of delivering simplicity within a many-to-many network of trading partners. A network’s features, from its search functionality to the matching of buyers with suggested suppliers, must aid the dual goals of transparency and ease of use. Predictive and generative AI capabilities augment businesses’ ability to discover trading partners on the basis of complementary resources, mutual value, and strategic alignment. With every successive use, generative AI sharpens its ability to anticipate operations professionals’ requirements to match supply with demand. Meanwhile, AI helps businesses to automate their most time-consuming procurement and supply chain activities through predictive mechanisms as well, hastening the ability to arrive at better, more informed decisions. When applied to the broadest possible sets of operational data, AI removes the guesswork from business-to-business commerce and replaces it with new leads, renewed confidence, and resilient supply chains.</p>
  <p>With these objectives in mind, <a href="/topics/business-network">SAP Business Network</a> is transforming its powerful discovery functionality into a simple chat prompt this year. Also in 2024, generative AI will enable SAP Business Network to create catalog content based on existing data in the network, detect potential errors within invoices, and obtain quote requests from buyers via natural-language, on-screen dialogue with matched suppliers. Integrating AI capabilities into SAP Business Network thus promises to reshape the trading partner experience by enabling buyers to reach far more suppliers with precision for the specific goods and services they produce. Trading partners large and small benefit equally from the increased flow of accurate, detailed, and complete information identifying each other’s offerings and competitive advantages.</p>
  <p>As AI technologies take shape and mature, infusing intelligence natively into business processes, digital commerce platforms are certain to introduce many enhanced capabilities. Naturally, with its scale and history of innovation, you can expect SAP Business Network to lead the way. But you’ll know the moment that artificial intelligence has truly transformed enterprise software when its features subtly blend in, almost imperceptibly, to simplify everyday operational processes, making business applications more intuitive and predictive for trading partners. That is our vision for AI at SAP Business Network, where the intelligence may be increasingly artificial but the commitment to customer success is invariably genuine.</p>

      <div>With geopolitical conflict and climate change roiling global shipping corridors from the <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2463151/business-economy">Suez Canal</a> to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/panama-canal-does-not-plan-transit-restrictions-least-until-april-2024-02-07">Panama</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/persian-gulf-oman-strait-hormuz-3a906e909be2ce63c87c1b208ed05baa">elsewhere</a>, enterprises rely increasingly on cloud-based business networks and artificial intelligence (AI) applications to extend visibility, facilitate collaboration, and ensure they stay one step ahead of the looming threat of disruption.</div>
    </div>

  <p>Meanwhile, as legislation to bolster transparency in supply chains <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/service/archive/supply-chain-act-1872076">takes</a> <a href="https://minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/jasonwood/Pages/modern-slavery-act-delivers-transparency-in-supply-chains.aspx">hold</a> <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/SB657">around</a> <a href="https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-10.6">the</a> <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/12/14/corporate-sustainability-due-diligence-council-and-parliament-strike-deal-to-protect-environment-and-human-rights">world</a>, the digital platforms through which trading partners carry out interconnected operational processes have become indispensable for managing risk, advancing sustainability objectives, and verifying adherence to ethical business practices – even as volatility in international commerce gathers pace.</p>
  <p>After rebounding from several years of logjammed seaports, idled factories, and quarantined workers, many businesses find that though COVID-19 has receded, disruption stubbornly persists. Yet visibility across all aspects of the supply chain – from sourcing raw materials and managing logistics capacity to securing working capital solutions and managing dispersed physical assets – remains paramount in the quest to ensure business continuity, instill operational resilience, and deepen competitive advantage.</p>

  <p>To help provide businesses with the 360-degree visibility and collaborative capabilities they require across complex trading relationships, SAP Business Network can connect people, processes, and systems across multiple enterprises to help digitize transactions, harness data-driven insights, and create transparent, resilient, and sustainable supply chains. Through <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/solutions.html#active_tab_item_1602592051931">SAP Business Network for Procurement</a>, trading partners can gain process efficiencies, improve supply assurance, and achieve business process and regulatory compliance by increasing operational transparency. With <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/solutions.html#active_tab_item_1602592257238">SAP Business Network Supply Chain Collaboration</a>, companies can achieve supply chain visibility by enabling plan-driven automation, optimizing capacity and inventory, and streamlining workflow. Aided by <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/solutions.html#active_tab_item_1602592296240">SAP Business Network for Logistics</a>, shippers and carriers can work together in unison, track and trace goods in transit, and achieve transparency throughout the supply chain by optimizing logistics processes, increasing on-time deliveries, and mitigating third-party risk. Relying on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/solutions.html#active_tab_item_1660146110353">SAP Business Network Asset Collaboration</a>, owners, operators, and service providers can strengthen joint processes and the flow of shared information through a single, consistent version of asset master data to help streamline asset maintenance processes and reduce maintenance costs. With the benefit of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/solutions.html#active_tab_item_1660146142567">SAP Business Network for Finance</a>, trading partners can enhance payment security, free up working capital through early-payment discounts, and leverage access to capital bound up in outstanding receivables.</p>
  <p>By linking together the routine business processes of trading partners, cloud-based networks establish the breadth of data necessary to apply predictive and generative AI applications to yield meaningful insights and outcomes. Through large language models and other forms of machine learning, cloud-based applications create new content with characteristics resembling that which precedes it. With every successive effort, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/innovations.html#ai">generative AI</a> sharpens its ability to tailor desired content.</p>
  <p>As the world’s largest platform for business-to-business commerce, SAP Business Network can present an ideal setting for generative AI, in that it helps bring together an extremely large volume of trading partners across hundreds of millions of transactions representing US$5.3 trillion in commerce annually. Later this year, generative AI capabilities in SAP Business Network will be able to help detect errors and present automatic summaries when businesses create invoices. AI will also enable the network to help enrich catalog content and discovery posting responses for suppliers.</p>
  <p>SAP Business Network has accumulated significant structured content over many years to help generate broad operational insights for trading partners. When buyers, suppliers, carriers, and financing solution providers share operational data with each other in real time, the mutual value they create can be exponential rather than additive, enabling all participants in commerce to plan ahead with confidence, continuity, and enduring resilience.</p>

        <p>Dive beneath the buzzwords to find profitable steps forward for manufacturers, from sustainability to security to supply chain.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By Derek Slater</p>
  <p>The factory of the future will be more:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modular, flexible, and agile</li>
    <li>Efficient and profitable</li>
    <li>Interconnected, both internally and to business partners</li>
    <li>Sustainable, for both its environment and community</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Easy to say, but ever so complicated to do?</p>
  <p>Plenty of companies struggle with the capital investments, workforce requirements, and the data-savvy to build a factory of <em>today</em>, let alone <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>
  <p>Further, to try to decipher future developments is to wade smack into a jungle of jargon and “consultantese,” from industry 4.0 and software-defined factories to analog front ends (AFEs) and 4D printing. (Yes, 4D – that’s not a typo.)<a href=""><sup>1</sup></a></p>
  <p>Nevertheless, business as usual won't cut it. Today's environment of “permacrisis,” as SAP's Richard Howells says in <a href="/resources/supply-chain-innovation-whats-next">an expert panel discussion</a> – wars, pandemic hangover, shipping backups, extreme weather events, energy costs, unstable countries – stresses traditional factories and supply chains to the breaking point. And the planetary reverberations of manufacturing, its by-products, its resources, and energy use, are existential.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, “in manufacturing, sustainability is profitability,” SAP's Mike Lackey notes in the same discussion. Increasing efficiency and agility while decreasing waste <em>will</em> feed the bottom line. In other words, building the future factory is about making goods and making money. And not just in this quarter, but for decades to come.</p>
  <p>Delving into the concrete topics underneath the pie-in-the-sky vision and through the jargon jungle, it's clear that technical progress is happening on all fronts, at a dizzying rate. Forward-looking manufacturers can take advantage of those developments now, to profit despite permacrisis challenges, while building toward tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Here are key takeaways from our special report, with links to further details in nine in-depth articles exploring the future factory. Learn how to make smart workforce and technology investments on the way there, and how to create more value beyond the factory walls in your broader supply chain.</p>

  <h2 id="the-regenerative-factory">The regenerative factory</h2>
  <p>What might a factory look like in a decade or two? Let's start by looking at <strong>how sustainability will shape tomorrow’s factories</strong>, because sustainability equals profitability, as <a href="/resources/profitable-purpose-the-future-of-business-sustainability">SAP Insights research has confirmed</a>.</p>
  <p>The lead article of our special report, “<a href="/blogs/the-sustainable-factory-of-the-future">The Sustainable Factory of the Future</a>,” sounds a perhaps counterintuitive note: the average factory footprint may be much smaller than today’s.</p>
  <p>For decades, manufacturing has focused on repeatable efficiency at an ever-greater scale. Today’s driving force, on the other hand, is increasingly a demand for more agility: for example, the ability to shift manufacturing from one place to another based on demand, capacity, or disruptive events, as well as the need to produce more customized products, rather than identical widgets. Moving to a smaller form factor also has positive implications for sustainable – or, better, regenerative – operations.</p>
  <p>“The regenerative principle is to return things better than before,” says Stanford researcher Trond Undheim. “The larger the scale, the more steel and carbon you are using, and the more difficult it becomes to disassemble. Regeneration is all about disassembly, leaving no trace, actually leaving it better.”</p>
  <p>It’s not just about disassembly; today’s ongoing operations benefit too. The use of smaller facilities requires greater efficiency, using less space and power. It also suggests multiple, dispersed production points located closer to where the manufactured goods will be used, reducing the financial and environmental costs of delivery.</p>
  <p>Whatever the size and scale, prominent manufacturers such as Interface, Siemens, and Tesla offer strategies for future factories to address all these areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Carbon:</strong> Cut emissions faster. Spot issues and prioritize improvements by using Internet of Things (IoT) data. Store (sequester) carbon in products, as well as in the factory itself (in cement and other building materials).</li>
    <li><strong>Waste:</strong> Use analytics to find advanced ways to reduce waste. Additive manufacturing yields less scrap. Reduce raw material use; recycle waste on site; think “circularly” about products through end-of-life.</li>
    <li><strong>Power:</strong> Go beyond solar with renewable sources, low-emissivity windows that reduce heating and cooling costs, green hydrogen power, and improved battery and passive energy-harvesting technology for local power storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Capture and use rainwater; detect leaks with digital twins; treat and reuse wastewater on-site; use green and blue roofs to reduce or manage runoff.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="the-smarter-factory">The smart(er) factory</h2>
  <p>Now let’s turn to the <strong>rapid advance of industrial smarts</strong>, which is happening in both the IT arena and in shop floor operating technology (OT).</p>
  <p>Tomorrow’s factory will make those of yesterday, sit in the corner with a dunce cap.</p>
  <p>A raft of technologies are already converging, including both traditional IT elements (cloud computing, edge computing, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, 5G wireless) and new OT devices and capabilities (advanced robots, cobots, autonomous transport, additive manufacturing machines, computer vision). This convergence is what many describe as “<a href="https://www.sap.cn/products/scm/industry-4-0/industry-4-0-strategy.html">industry 4.0</a>” – technologies that make possible “<a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/what-is-a-smart-factory.html">smart factories</a>” with new levels of process automation, greater efficiency and utilization, right-time right-place inventory, and increased safety.</p>
  <p>This much, you already know. And some of the near-term possibilities are easy to envision. Already in 2024, a humanoid-style robot built by Figure.ai learned, reportedly in 10 hours of training time, how to make coffee <a href="https://twitter.com/adcock_brett/status/1743987597301399852">by watching humans do it</a>, then trying, failing, and improving. The distance between that extremely expensive prototype Keurig-butler and a robotic system that learns complex assembly line tasks through computer vision isn’t far.</p>
  <p>But you also know that other, currently unforeseen smart-factory advances will lurk further over the horizon.</p>
  <p>So how to be prepared to assimilate new technology constantly, rather than seeing each wave render current machines or whole factories obsolete? That’s one motivator behind the idea of software-defined factories, where more flexible, programmable shop floor equipment can add features, change configurations, and connect to new systems with software updates rather than hardware swaps.</p>
  <p>However, as “<a href="/resources/production-logistics-and-the-new-ot">Production Logistics and the New OT</a>” find, staying on top of changes in operational advances relies on process and personnel as much as on technology: <strong>The time for meaningful IT/OT collaboration is truly overdue</strong>.</p>
  <p>When these historically siloed teams cooperate effectively, their companies can get better end-to-end visibility of manufacturing processes, machine health, efficient staffing and inventory movement, and much more while building a flexible technical architecture that more readily absorbs change and integrates whatever’s next.</p>
  <p>Companies including Pfizer, Chobani, and Kohl's show ways to cross this long-standing divide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Involve both functions earlier</strong> in each other’s projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide training and exposure</strong> for OT people in IT processes, and vice versa.</li>
    <li><strong>Set up CIOs</strong>, most often from an IT background, as leaders and learners-in-chief – actively diving into OT technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Create leadership development programs</strong> that bring IT and OT people together.</li>
    <li><strong>Address the divide head-on with humor and empathy.</strong> Try an exercise in which each side role plays the other.</li>
    <li>Consider <strong>using cybersecurity as a natural starting point</strong> for tighter IT/OT collaboration (see the next point).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="the-secure-factory">The secure factory</h2>
  <p>About <strong>that security thing, in this highly connected factory...</strong></p>
  <p>A shop full of networked, intelligent machines needs to rethink its approach to security. Ransomware attacks knocking over manufacturing operations in the past few years have made this abundantly clear. The so-called attack surface is expanding as more OT comes online and data drives more automated processes.</p>
  <p>In “<a href="/blogs/twelve-security-issues-for-evolving-factories">12 Security Issues to Address as Your Factories Evolve</a>,” our experts list key steps, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Increase visibility.</strong> “Manufacturers will need to clarify the data flows between the IT and OT networks, as well as the assets that bridge this gap – for example, addressing the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, and building automation systems.”</li>
    <li><strong>Protect power supplies and building automation systems.</strong> IT/OT security keeps adding more potential targets to defend. Local generation and storage create new challenges for safety, security, and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider mobile vulnerabilities.</strong> The fast-changing world of autonomous shop floor tools that use new communication protocols that aren't yet well tested for security.</li>
    <li><strong>Raise your threat awareness game.</strong> “Another strong pillar of defense is maintaining knowledge of the common tactics, techniques, and procedures enacted by adversaries and forming an accurate view of your organization’s posture relative to them,” says former chief information security officer Dawn Cappelli.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="converting-the-old-factory-into-a-new-factory">Converting the old factory into a new factory</h2>
  <p>Last but not least: <strong>retrofitting to bring older factories into the game</strong>.</p>
  <p>Elon Musk could scare up €5 billion to build Tesla’s “Gigafactory Berlin” from scratch, chock-full of automation and AI. Maybe your company doesn’t have that kind of money sitting around.</p>
  <p>Does that mean you stay on the sidelines? Do you need billions for a brand-new shop to even get into this smart-factory game? Do old factories <em>really</em> have to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap?</p>
  <p>Happily, they don’t. “<a href="/resources/how-industry-4-0-factories-can-still-embrace-the-past">How Industry 4.0 Factories Can Still Embrace the Past</a><u>”</u> explains why and how modernization strategies can connect older machines and buildings to modern data-driven manufacturing operations.</p>
  <p>True, it’s not as simple as slapping sensors on everything; collecting terabytes of environmental and performance data doesn’t guarantee you’ll find the right signals needed for predictive maintenance or more efficient materials movement. However, careful analysis of likely areas of improvement, the data types needed, and cost-benefit tradeoffs can lead to targeted investment and big payoff.</p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shift-by-shift, smart sensor data can provide granular insights to increase throughput.</li>
    <li>Supply chain sensor data can improve the traceability of raw material flow, indicating if a manufacturer is spending unnecessary time sourcing and procuring raw materials.</li>
    <li>Correlating real-time environmental and machine performance data may indeed reveal risks for machine and assembly line downtime.</li>
    <li>Networking and geolocation technologies can help track the movement of materials and goods, spotting inefficiencies, low inventory levels, or misplaced palettes.</li>
    <li>Combining new data sources over time can help build an increasingly valuable digital twin of an older facility and its workflows.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The experience of companies like Spirit AeroSystems and Gary Works provides modernization guidance tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ongoing employee training and assessment is vital.</li>
    <li>IT and OT teams need clear, shared goals (notice a theme here?).</li>
    <li>Top executives have to lead the change management charge.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="the-future-manufacturing-workforce">The future manufacturing workforce</h2>
  <p>New factories require new skills. In “<a href="/resources/advanced-manufacturing-skills-workers-will-need">Advanced Manufacturing Skills Workers Will Need,”</a> experts foresee how common roles will change. For instance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Production planners</strong> will use predictive analytics to anticipate machine downtime or late-arriving materials; work out solutions, such as predictive machine maintenance or purchasing more materials in advance; and look for continuous improvement ideas to reduce waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Line leaders</strong> will spend less time creating reports and more time coaching and problem solving with their team members.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine operators</strong> will probably have more general training, oversee more machines at once, and work with AI tools for problem solving and light maintenance. They may rely on voice and gestural commands to operate the equipment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These changes put a premium on flexibility, continuous learning, and problem-solving skills for all manufacturing employees.</p>
  <p>Finding or creating the workforce for these challenges will involve a mix of strategies, as noted in “<a href="/resources/hunting-for-advanced-manufacturing-talent-four-moves">Four Steps for Hunting for Advanced Manufacturing Talent,”</a> including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rewriting job descriptions.</strong> You may find help with this from industry associations or other groups. Research Institute AIM Photonics worked with MIT to develop advanced job descriptions specific to the photonics industry.</li>
    <li><strong>Reskilling current employees.</strong> Bosch plans to spend €1 billion over five years to reskill employees in advanced tech areas ranging from AI to electric vehicle engineering, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reskilling-employees-is-a-priority-for-companies-like-bosch-2022-3"><em>Business Insider</em> reports</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Partnering with local educational institutions to expand the talent pool.</strong> In southern China, Guizhou Equipment Manufacturing Vocational College has created new courses covering digital process design, advanced machine tools, and debugging industrial robots. It provides specific retraining for workers in all career stages, including laid off and unemployed persons, as detailed in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/upskilling-employees">an Autodesk article</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refurbishing your workforce and investing in local education is also part of how the future factory provides regenerative benefits to its local community.</p>

  <h2 id="beyond-the-factory--the-future-supply-chain">Beyond the factory – the future supply chain</h2>
  <p>Inevitably, the future factory will connect more directly to more partners – that's the only way to work toward real-time, decision-making, based on demand.</p>
  <p>Your <strong>contract manufacturers (CMs)</strong> may be your closest partners. Yet typically this is an area of limited (i.e., almost zero) visibility in manufacturers’ supply chains. “<a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/contract-manufacturing-supply-chains-blind-spot.html">Contract Manufacturing: Supply Chains’ Blind Spot</a><u>”</u> explains why: it's not fundamentally a tech issue, it's a problem of trust, trust, trust!</p>
  <p>Germany's LkSG law (also known as the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act) demands more visibility into a manufacturer’s supply chain – both EU- and worldwide – to help weed out labor abuse and similar problems. But whether you're solving for compliance or something else, every disruption or change can present a chance to improve supply chain performance too. Example: during the pandemic, Haier Group, based in China, mobilized its supply chain, including CMs, to share information through a homegrown cloud application. Its CM partners reported results, including a reduction in cycle time, reduced procurement costs, and increased customer orders.</p>
  <p>How to improve visibility and collaboration with CMs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Communicate to partners that regulatory requirements are an opportunity</strong> to improve processes and profits for both OEMs and CMs.</li>
    <li><strong>You go first</strong> in sharing systems and data with your contract manufacturing partners. Show trust to earn trust and provide value to gain value.</li>
    <li><strong>Rework contracts</strong> to formally spell out how the parties will work together in a mutually beneficial way, as opposed to just defining a transactional model. For example, a <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article details a method of contracting that uses a “<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/11/3-ways-to-build-trust-with-your-suppliers">vested sourcing model</a>.”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With trust improving, improved <strong>supply chain technology</strong> should surely yield better performance – right? But somehow, often, it doesn’t.</p>
  <p>In “<a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/supply-chain-innovation-whats-next.html">Supply Chain Innovation: What’s Next?</a><u>,”</u> three experts explore why roughly eight out of 10 supply chain tech projects fail, and how to flip that ratio.</p>
  <p>Their recommendations include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Innovation benefits from <strong>a digital officer</strong> who can “paint a picture of the possible” to secure investment in pilot projects.</li>
    <li>However, they then have to let go of successful pilots and <strong>hand ownership over to the business.</strong></li>
    <li>Innovators and project leads should <strong>“show return over and over.”</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Get your innovation funding model right.</strong> Pilots are often funded from centralized technology budgets, but then quickly the model should shift to the infrastructure budget plus co-funding from business lines and factories.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared goals</strong> help get the plants to invest.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="beyond-the-factory--understand-the-value-you-create">Beyond the factory – understand the value you create</h2>
  <p>As we said at the outset – there’s a lot of detail to consider and work through. Here’s a parting idea to help clear the mind and prioritize decisions: <strong>start by reexamining how your company creates value</strong>.</p>
  <p>A factory is one link in a chain, and (ostensibly) the whole chain is designed to deliver something of great value to a customer who really needs it. Consultant Simon Wardley argues that a better understanding of how value is created in, and by, the product should yield smarter business decisions, resulting in better factory design and use.</p>
  <p>Seems obvious? Wardley contends most companies fail at this fundamental level: “My experience has been that organizations are not very strong at understanding users, they’re much poorer at understanding users’ needs, and they can be quite poor at understanding the chain of components required to meet those needs.”</p>
  <p>· He says lack of visibility beyond the next step in the value chain is one culprit.</p>
  <p>· Failure to map your competitive space is another – accounting for change over time, such as a gradual commodification of components.</p>
  <p>Test your future-factory assumptions with Wardley's insights in “<a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/landscape-view-into-value-chain-relationships.html">A Landscape View into Value Chain Relationships</a>.” You’ll gain a fresh outlook on familiar terrain.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>When Danielle Thomé was a teenager, she asked her father for a job. That’s not unusual, especially since her father was the founder of Projex Engenharia, a successful business in Brazil. But the business focused on civil and industrial construction, an industry where a 15-year-old girl didn’t fit the typical job description, despite her passion for civil engineering. Although Thomé would eventually take over her father’s business, her road to success was paved with many challenges.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“One of the biggest challenges I faced was the age-old problem of gender discrimination,” Thomé recalled years later. She is one of many women driven to lead businesses that reflect their life passions.</p>
  <p>Like other entrepreneurial women, she needed support. But where are the networks to help women turn their passions into successful businesses? Thomé found her network in an SAP customer. <a href="https://weconnectinternational.org/">WEConnect International</a> connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers around the world. As a result of becoming WEConnect International certified – and a lot of hard work by Thomé and her team – Projex Engenharia’s revenue grew by a staggering 200% in just two years.</p>
  <h2 id="many-challenges-huge-potential-impact">Many Challenges, Huge Potential Impact</h2>
  <p>Women who start and lead businesses face unique challenges. Cultural and social norms, or simply being underestimated by investors, can impede their entrepreneurial efforts. <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/02/for-female-founders-only-fundraising-from-female-vcs-comes-at-a-cost">Harvard Business Review</a> observes that “women are massively under-represented among both venture-backed entrepreneurs and VC investors.” It adds that companies founded solely by women receive <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">less than 3%</a> of all venture capital investments.</p>
  <p>Also, the pandemic exacerbated the imbalance in unpaid care work – managing the household or caring for children and aging parents – which disproportionally affects women in business.</p>
  <p>Women must also deal with the challenges other businesses face, including access to markets, information technology gaps, and the red tape involved with government programs designed to help new businesses.</p>
  <p>Yet despite these challenges, women-owned and women-led businesses offer the potential to make a significant impact on the global economy. The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/this-is-why-women-must-play-a-greater-role-in-the-global-economy/">World Economic Forum (WEF)</a> observed that “societies with greater gender equality not only offer better socioeconomic opportunities for women, but also tend to grow faster and more equitably.”</p>
  <p>The WEF also reports that advancing women’s employment <a href="https://initiatives.weforum.org/accelerators-network/gender-parity">could add US$12 trillion to global GDP and boost some countries’ economic output by as much as 35%</a>.</p>
  <p>Yet despite a clear business case, the WEF sees global progress stagnating.</p>
  <h2 id="who-has-the-power-to-drive-change-all-of-us">Who Has the Power to Drive Change? All of Us.</h2>
  <p>Traditionally, the <a href="/topics/procurement">procurement</a> function within larger organizations has held the power to fill supply chain gaps and build networks of suppliers. Yet today, other voices are making themselves heard. Consumers are expressing preferences to buy from women and other diverse businesses. Around the world – for example in the United States, Australia, and Canada – government regulations are requiring increased diversity and inclusion.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="sap-business-network-powers-transparency-resiliency-and-sustainability">SAP Business Network powers transparency, resiliency, and sustainability</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Additionally, the C-suite is reframing corporate policy to reflect more sophisticated approaches to selecting suppliers. In my role as customer officer, SAP Intelligent Spend &#x26; Business Network, I see business leaders prioritizing inclusive sourcing metrics within their procurement strategies to help ensure they have access to all the world’s best suppliers, not just the ones they always buy from.</p>
  <p>Concerned about supply chain risks, procurement leaders are increasingly adopting localization strategies. While seeking new local suppliers, they also focus on inclusive sourcing. Of course, finding diverse suppliers is not easy – even local ones. Many women-owned businesses are small entities, not well-known in the business community. They often lack access to communication technology that would help them create greater visibility for the business.</p>
  <p>How can we make it easier to connect enterprise buyers and women-owned businesses?</p>
  <h2 id="creating-connections-with-sap-technology">Creating Connections with SAP Technology</h2>
  <p>As president, CEO, and co-founder of <a href="https://weconnectinternational.org/">WEConnect International</a>, Elizabeth Vazquez is a leader in women’s economic empowerment and global supplier diversity and inclusion. Through WEConnect International, she helps women around the world grow their businesses to create wealth, hire more people, and contribute to the prosperity of their communities.</p>
  <p>Last week, she participated in panel discussions during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The discussions focused on opportunities to direct more corporate spend to women-owned businesses, not only to do good but to close supply chain gaps.</p>
  <p>“Women-owned businesses are a valuable and under-utilized resource,” she said. “The women who run these businesses understand what their communities need most, and they are in a unique position to help solve them. In the process, they are creating entirely new industries.”</p>
  <p>WEConnect International recognizes that to compete in the global marketplace, women-owned businesses must be visible to potential customers. It developed the WECommunity platform, a global register of women-owned businesses that makes it easier for buyers to find women-owned suppliers.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the initial version of WECommunity relied on technology that delivered a poor user experience, making searching the register cumbersome. WEConnect International needed a scalable, global solution that offered smooth user experiences in multiple languages for buyers and suppliers.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/supplier-lifecycle.html">SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance</a> solution and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html">SAP Business Network</a> more than met these criteria. As an added advantage, many of the WECommunity member buyers were already transacting on SAP Business Network. SAP partner Premikati Inc., a women-owned business, was engaged to help deploy the SAP solutions.</p>
  <p>In its first year, the improved functionality of WECommunity produced dramatic outcomes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Buyer membership increased by 91%, a $2 trillion increase in purchasing power.</li>
    <li>Over 6,000 women-owned businesses experienced revenue growth, creating 24,000 new jobs.</li>
    <li>Over 7,800 new registered women-owned businesses joined the database, a 95% growth.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>“By making it easier for women to register their businesses and for large buyers to find them, our online portal based on the SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance solution, SAP Business Network, and SAP Business Technology Platform helps women compete in a global marketplace,” Vazquez explained.</p>
  <h2 id="breaking-through-the-barriers">Breaking Through the Barriers</h2>
  <p>Remember Thomé, the teenage girl who wanted to work in her father’s construction business? Today, she is owner-director of Projex Engenharia, the business her father founded.</p>
  <p><a href="https://weconnectinternational.org/success-stories/danielle-thome/">As a noted in a recent profile</a>, Projex Engenharia earned the WEConnect International Women’s Business Enterprise Certification. Thomé leveraged the global network of women suppliers and large buyers to become a more confident and assertive leader.</p>
  <p>The relationship has also helped produce significant benefits for her business. In just six years, Projex Engenharia landed six large corporations as clients. This enabled the company to hire more people, ensure their safety and well-being, and support social, health, and environmental campaigns.</p>
  <p>SAP is committed to helping all customers achieve their diversity and equity goals. And it is gratifying to know that our technology has become a valuable tool in making this happen.</p>

      <div><a href="https://www.jowat.com/en/">Jowat Group</a> is one of the world’s top adhesive manufacturers for industrial use. Tradition and experience from 100 years of corporate development and experience allow it to act as a leading company in technology and innovation in numerous markets and application areas.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Jowat SE’s annual production amounts to 100,000 tons of industrial adhesives. Production is complex and requires high volumes of specialized chemicals and a tremendous amount of power. With raw materials and energy costs skyrocketing, premium manufacturer Jowat looked to get a tighter grip on its inventory management and production processes.</p>
  <p>To ensure maximum efficiency, Jowat requires enough raw materials to fulfill orders while minimizing waste and inventory costs. Moreover, the company needs smooth workflows, as any delay in order placement, production, or the delivery of raw materials can have huge cost implications for the company. As a result, Jowat works hard to ensure that its 24/7 manufacturing processes always run like clockwork.</p>
  <p>With demand for industrial adhesives surging, the company was eager to ensure that its production processes could scale to meet increasing order numbers and still deliver optimum efficiency.</p>

  <h2 id="targeting-seamless-digital-workflows">Targeting Seamless Digital Workflows</h2>
  <p>Originally established in 1919, Jowat is no stranger to innovation. Leaders at Jowat identified that the next stage of the company’s evolution would require a radical digital transformation of its production and inventory management processes.</p>
  <p>“Our factory workers relied heavily on paper-based processes,” explained Dirk-Alexander Segger, Detmold plant manager at Jowat. “For instance, when employees had finished mixing and decanting adhesives, they handwrote notes to track the volume and type of raw materials that they used during the process. Shortly after decanting, workers would then input the information from their notes into our inventory management and manufacturing execution systems, adding to their workload and increasing the risk of errors.”</p>
  <p>Tracking materials usage manually created time delays, potential for human errors, and discrepancies between the stock numbers recorded in Jowat’s inventory system and the actual volume of raw materials available on the factory floor. Moreover, with information stored across multiple systems and in different formats, plant managers had no clarity to identify process bottlenecks or potential enhancements.</p>
  <p>Annette Podleschny-Borchardt, project lead at Jowat, commented: “To enhance efficiency, improve transparency, and prepare for growth, we decided it was time to go entirely paperless. Building digital processes would give us a more detailed, up-to-date picture of our stock position, which would help drive smarter raw materials purchasing decisions and production improvements.”</p>
  <p>“We aimed to take a more proactive approach to our manufacturing processes. Developing robust, reliable, end-to-end digital workflows was the perfect way to achieve this goal,” explained Christine Künne, head of IT and Business Process Services at Jowat SE.</p>
  <h2 id="embracing-digital-transformation">Embracing Digital Transformation</h2>
  <p>To find the best solution to support its digital transformation initiative, Jowat invited multiple technology vendors to outline the strengths of their solutions. To keep customization low, Jowat targeted a solution that it could easily adapt to meet the highly specialized nature of just-in-time chemicals manufacturing.</p>
  <p>After reviewing 15 different solutions, Jowat selected <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/digital-manufacturing-cloud.html">SAP Digital Manufacturing</a>. In addition to providing a solid foundation for digitalization, SAP Digital Manufacturing can also integrate seamlessly with Jowat’s existing SAP solutions, including <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/extended-warehouse-management.html">SAP Extended Warehouse Management</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP).</p>

  <p>“We were immediately interested in SAP Digital Manufacturing because it is a cloud-native solution,” commented Segger. “Previously, we used on-premise solutions that required us to carry out extensive and disruptive updates. With SAP Digital Manufacturing, we get instant access to the latest features thanks to the quarterly release schedule.”</p>
  <p>Jowat also valued SAP’s proactive engagement with the chemicals manufacturing industry. “We really appreciate that SAP is eager to co-innovate with industry leaders like Jowat to develop next-generation manufacturing solutions,” said Podleschny-Borchardt. “Through the SAP Customer Engagement Initiative, we can help expert developers at SAP build smart factory solutions that meet the needs of our sector down to the finest detail.”</p>
  <h2 id="sticking-with-the-experts">Sticking with the Experts</h2>
  <p>To ensure a smooth implementation of SAP Digital Manufacturing, Jowat relied on support from SAP Services and Support.</p>
  <p>“Whenever we hit a stumbling block, the experts helped us work through the issues. For instance, we wanted to develop a dedicated production operation dashboard, which would give plant managers fast access to key production metrics. As this was uncharted territory, it naturally took a lot of time and energy to work through and SAP was behind us every step of the way,” said Segger.</p>
  <p>Currently, Jowat is completing the first phase of the SAP Digital Manufacturing implementation at its Detmold factory before expanding the solution across all plants. Künne explained: “With a phased implementation, we can ensure that the processes we build at our Detmold plant are tried and tested to deliver maximum efficiency. This will give us the best chance of success when we roll out these processes across all our facilities.”</p>
  <p>“Consultants from SAP Services and Support brought not only their expertise to the project, but also the willingness to listen to the needs and the challenges of our industry. Because of this, we were able to collaborate extremely effectively,” added Podleschny-Borchardt.</p>
  <h2 id="driving-efficient-manufacturing-with-high-quality-data">Driving Efficient Manufacturing with High-Quality Data</h2>
  <p>With SAP Digital Manufacturing, Jowat left error-prone, manual processes behind and now benefits from seamless digital workflows with end-to-end transparency. This helps increase quality and ease work for shop floor operators. The activity confirmation is automatically done in the SAP system, enabling real-time inventory insight.</p>
  <p>Consequently, Jowat gained the following benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>100% digitalized manufacturing process</li>
    <li>One source of truth for detailed production information</li>
    <li>Time savings of three person days per week through automated raw material consumption updates allowing employees focus on higher value activities</li>
    <li>100% accurate inventory</li>
  </ul>
  <p>“Today workers feed consumption information at the point of production. Previously, it would take one full-time employee three days a week to track raw materials consumption,” said Segger. “With SAP Digital Manufacturing, we have a real-time, accurate picture of our raw materials usage and needs. This is helping us optimize usage and reduce costs.”</p>
  <p>Podleschny-Borchardt added: “Production processes are so much faster now that we have built streamlined digital processes. Before, our paper-based ways of working could add up to five days to production timelines. With SAP Digital Manufacturing, we’ve shaved off this time, allowing us to produce and distribute products to our customers much faster, boosting satisfaction.”</p>
  <h2 id="planning-ahead-for-an-ai-driven-future">Planning Ahead for an AI-Driven Future</h2>
  <p>With reliable, up-to-date information in SAP Digital Manufacturing, plant managers and leaders at Jowat can have full visibility across the entire manufacturing cycle. “SAP Digital Manufacturing has helped improve the traceability of our products and given us a much more detailed understanding of our manufacturing operations. Ultimately, that helps to enhance planning and provides new insights into potential process improvements,” said Künne.</p>
  <p>Jowat’s plans for SAP Digital Manufacturing go far beyond a global rollout. The company is already exploring the potential to scale and streamline manufacturing processes further with artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.</p>
  <p>“AI holds tremendous potential for us,” reflected Podleschny-Borchardt. “We’re excited to explore how it can help us to ensure consistently excellent quality across heavily customized product lines and how we can enhance production uptime with IoT-driven predictive maintenance. Having an AI-ready solution like SAP Digital Manufacturing at the heart of our operations makes taking these next steps in our innovation journey much easier.”</p>
  <p>Summarizing the overall benefits, Künne concluded: “With the implementation of SAP Digital Manufacturing through SAP Services and Support, we see ourselves on the way to becoming a transparent factory with a reduction in risks, errors, and process costs thanks to optimized processes.”</p>

  <p>The IDC MarketScape report notes these competitive strengths of SAP Business Network:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Depth and breadth</strong> of product features and functionalities, as well as a future road map covering all major B2B collaboration categories (indirect, direct material, MRO logistics, financial, services, and sustainability) and scenarios in an end user, persona-based manner.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration and extensibility capabilities</strong> include integration between SAP ERP, SAP procurement modules, other applications like ERP, SCAM, and customer applications, and technologies such as machine learning, AI, and blockchain through SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).</li>
    <li><strong>Global adoption and breadth of collaboration</strong> makes SAP among the industry’s largest, highly adopted B2B collaboration platforms enabling trading partners to collaborate in real time. Ongoing efforts to harmonize commerce, asset intelligence, and logistics continue to enhance the power of the connected economy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The IDC MarketScape report notes, “Manufacturers and retailers looking for a vendor of both a multi-enterprise network and supply chain procurement application should consider SAP,” citing the “breadth and depth of [its] business network capabilities, strategic road map vision, and unmatched integration with core SAP and non-SAP supply chain and procurement applications,” making SAP a strong choice.</p>

  <p>I’m so pleased that as a pioneer in business networks, we continue to be recognized for our commitment to executing our vision. As we’ve continued to evolve our road map, I’m reflecting on how far we’ve come and paved the way for the future of intelligent business networks. From the founding of Ariba Supplier Network in 1996 to what we’ve become today, SAP Business Network touches US$4.9 trillion in commerce annually across many business processes and industries and has over 2 million active users on the network.</p>
