  <p>A global leader in refractories, RHI Magnesita provides essential parts of the infrastructure that we use and need in our everyday lives. Supplying high-grade refractory products, systems and solutions, RHI Magnesita has 47 main production sites across the world, and ships its products to more than 100 countries.</p>
  <p>With its vision to sustainably manage heat to build a better world, RHI Magnesita needed a technology foundation that would allow end-to-end interaction across its customers, suppliers and business partners across all geographies, end markets and product lines. Choosing to implement a multi-tier landscape consisting of both SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, RHI Magnesita is now equipped to redefine all its technology processes and landscape.</p>
  <p>Ticiana Kobel, Executive VP Legal &#x26; Digital Transformation at RHI Magnesita, stated, “With the revamped digital landscape that we will shape together with SAP, RHI Magnesita will transform into a digitally fortified company, centered around our customers and driven by data. The transition to SAP S/4HANA Cloud marks a pivotal moment in RHI Magnesita’s journey toward unparalleled efficiency, agility, and innovation which will enable us to unlock real-time insights, streamline operations, and enhance decision-making across our global network.”</p>
  <p>With SAP S/4HANA Cloud, RHI Magnesita will have one unified view of its operations and supply chain, reducing its infrastructure footprint, and poises itself for better integration of future acquisitions while delivering cost savings.</p>
  <p>“RHI Magnesita is embarking on a true digital transformation that will see the streamlining of several landscapes that will allow it to leverage the cost savings, scalability and flexibility that comes with moving to the cloud,” said Alexander Klaeger, President of SAP MEE. “Already a leader in the industry, I’m excited to see RHI Magnesita use SAP S/4HANA Cloud to sustainably provide infrastructure the world needs.”</p>

  <p>A family-owned business with over 100 years of heritage, a presence in 170 markets, and more than 21,500 employees and nearly 80 factories globally, Roca Group had embraced digitalization to remain competitive and relevant in the dynamic sanitary industry. Having made several acquisitions over the years, Roca Group saw RISE with SAP as the ideal solution to consolidate various IT systems into one IT landscape. Roca’s decision in choosing SAP S/4HANA Cloud was driven by the desire to increase efficiency and the ability to make informed, real-time, data-driven business decisions.</p>
  <p>“Roca Group’s strategy is based on a long-term future vision supported by innovation, technology and sustainability,” said Albert Magrans, CEO of Roca Group. “Moving to SAP S/4HANA enables Roca to leverage the last technology and innovations of SAP software to boost our digital transformation. We are looking forward to faster execution speed, the enhancement of functionality with the Joule copilot, real-time analytics and further innovations from SAP and its ecosystem.”</p>
  <p>“Roca Group and SAP have collaborated closely for a number of years, with Roca trusting SAP with multiple SAP implementations,” said Manos Raptopoulos, VP of SAP Europe, Middle East and Africa. “Roca’s IT strategy is fully aligned with its business transformation with SAP solutions as an integral part of this strategy. Our close partnership allows our teams to have real-time insight into their business transformation, allowing for seamless integration of SAP solutions as they embark on their SAP S/4HANA Cloud journey.”</p>
  <p>In choosing SAP S/4HANA Cloud and various cloud solutions from SAP, such as SAP Customer Experience, SAP Ariba and SAP SuccessFactors solutions, Roca Group continues to be well-positioned to leverage SAP’s integrated suite of solutions that will enhance customer experience and potentially open up new business opportunities. In adopting a clean core approach, the group will have a single platform for its production centers and logistics platforms, tapping onto the SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain solution for demand and production planning, and the SAP Transportation Management application for transport management. With these solutions implemented, the operations already using them have seen a cubic capacity of their transports rise by 10%.</p>
  <p>Additionally, Roca plans to use SAP SuccessFactors to improve learning programs, manage global payroll and enhance the employee self-service portal through SAP’s suite of solutions in addition to travel expense management with SAP Concur solutions.</p>

  <p>This change is intended to reduce volatility in the dividend payout ratio and ensure close alignment between dividend payout and financial performance.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that <a href="https://www.puretechscientific.com/">PureTech Scientific LLC</a>, a global leader in the production of glycolic acid products, with a range of uses from skin care to clean and disinfect, has gone live with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition to position itself for further growth.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a href="https://ironpathcapital.com/">Iron Path Capital</a>, a private equity firm that acquired the company in 2023, has significant growth ambitions for PureTech Scientific. The first milestone for PureTech Scientific transformation was the move to the cloud to build a unified technology platform that would fully transition employees, customers and vendors with minimal disruption. Completed in 14 weeks, the implementation has already seen improved operational visibility and more timely transactional discipline.</p>
  <p>“The real-time insights and automation PureTech Scientific plans to gain from implementation of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition will help to streamline our operations and significantly enhance our ability to serve our customers with greater speed and accuracy,” PureTech Scientific CEO James Kanicky said. “This is just the beginning, and we’re excited for the opportunities ahead as we continue to drive growth and innovation with glycolic acid in the personal care and health care markets.”</p>

  <p>With its entire ERP now in the cloud, PureTech Scientific, the only North American glycolic acid producer, has real-time insight of its daily production and the ability to employ and automate barcoding. PureTech Scientific is now able to complete SAP goods issue and goods receipt transactions automatically with mobile devices, further reducing time needed for reporting.</p>
  <p>“SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition provides a best-in-class foundation for enterprise scalability, security and compliance,” said James Smith, executive advisor for Iron Path Capital and PureTech board member. “After an impressive 14-week implementation, PureTech Scientific is now able to have real-time business analytics and implement industry-best-practice, fit-to-standard workflows. The commencement of digital manufacturing cloud, barcoding and sales cloud capabilities will eliminate manual transactions, automate production recording and material movements, and employ mobile data collection for improved enterprise productivity and customer satisfaction.”</p>
  <p>Glycolic acid is used as the core agent in multiple industries, ranging from industrials to life science. PureTech Scientific expects the market to grow 10% CAGR over the next five years. SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition was selected specifically to support PureTech Scientific’s vision for growth. With scalability and integration as top priorities, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition allows the company to now focus on pursuing growth opportunities in new markets and new capabilities for new and existing customers.</p>
  <p>“PureTech Scientific has undergone a significant transformation in the past year,” SAP North America President Lloyd Adams said. “It has completely revamped its ERP system and moved to the cloud. Doing so allows for quick and data-driven business decisions as it enhances its capabilities and deepens its market share in key markets.”</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced the launch of a new guided premium learning offering with SAP Learning Hub and an enhanced certification program including a new role-based certification for SAP S/4HANA Cloud implementation consultants.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The demand for skilled IT professionals is expected to grow dramatically – up 23% by 2031 in the United States alone, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. To help meet this demand, the <a href="https://learning.sap.com/certifications/sap-certified-associate-implementation-consultant-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition?url_id=text-sapnewscenter-prdteng">new role-based certification for implementation consultants of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition</a> <a href="">emphasizes</a> core skills and competencies that can be applied across various cloud solutions from SAP and related versions.</p>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="grow-your-skills-future-proof-your-career-learn-sap-for-free-anywhere-anytime">Grow your skills. Future proof your career. Learn SAP for free, anywhere, anytime.</h3>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“The pace of change and the talent shortage call for a new approach to identifying future-focused skills and roles. Instead of focusing on traditional aspects like degrees, job histories and titles, professional competencies become more important,” says Andre Bechtold, senior vice president and head of solution and innovation experience at SAP. “By transitioning to role-based certifications that focus on core skills and competencies, the skillset of a learner becomes more valuable and gains sustainability and more relevance for longer periods of time.”</p>
  <p>Many organizations rely on SAP solutions and skilled professionals to ensure a smooth and fast transition and drive business success. The enhanced SAP Learning Hub provides access to great content and includes four certification attempts per learner per year. Subscribers can receive expert guidance in digital live sessions, on-demand hands-on practice systems, advanced analytics and learning management functionalities. This new digital premium offering marks a major step in the evolution of the SAP Learning portfolio. To meet the rapid pace of technological innovation and the need to quickly gain new and future-proof skills, SAP continues to help organizations learn and become certified faster to maximize their investment.</p>
  <p>With the need for fast, comprehensive and role-based upskilling, the new certification model will make continuous learning and assessments a priority. Starting in early second quarter, these changes will support customers, partners and individuals in gaining skills across the SAP solutions portfolio and keeping them up to date.</p>
  <p><a href="/">Partners can benefit from further advancements</a>, including a tailored partner experience with curated learning journeys, exclusive access to events and subject matter experts. A subscription to SAP Learning Hub, <a href="">partner</a> edition comes with a significantly reduced price per user per year and offers additional chances to earn certifications, as well as improved analysis and tracking features.</p>
  <p>With the move to the cloud in full swing, the enhanced SAP Learning Hub and new certification program help customers and partners meet the challenges of a tight labor market and necessary workforce transformation.

  <p>“There’s no technology advancing faster than AI,” SAP Chief AI Officer Philipp Herzig said. “While the progress on foundation models is impressive, there is a lot to learn and shape on the AI stack on top, in particular for designing and scaling distributed cloud applications in multi-cloud environments or to build AI agents in combination with large language models. The Sky Computing Lab at UC Berkeley conducts very relevant research in this field, and the frameworks that are being built look very promising.”</p>
  <p>Generative AI is a transformative force that is changing how people work, communicate and learn. As AI applications become increasingly sophisticated, efficient handling of large workloads becomes critical.</p>
  <p>UC Berkeley’s research activities focus on enabling users to run large language model applications and general AI workloads seamlessly on any cloud, substantially reducing cloud costs, tapping into best-in-class hardware on different clouds and enjoying higher resource availability, according to Ion Stoica, director of the Sky Computing Lab at UC Berkeley.</p>
  <p>The interconnection of clouds aims to create a distributed network, giving users access to a vast pool of computing power. This agility is crucial for dynamically allocating and scaling computational capabilities based on specific AI task requirements, ensuring optimal efficiency and cost-effectiveness for users. As the computational demands of AI continue to evolve, this approach ensures not only the scalability and efficiency of AI tasks but also lays the groundwork for an innovative and interoperable future in artificial intelligence.</p>
  <p>Through this collaboration with the Sky Computing Lab at UC Berkeley, SAP aims to advance knowledge in artificial intelligence. Besides AI-specific expertise, SAP will support graduate students through scholarships and internships.</p>

        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced that Hunkemöller International B.V., Europe’s fastest-growing lingerie brand, has moved to the cloud, leveraging the RISE with SAP solution to offer customers personalized experiences and to keep up with strong demand.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With more than 850 retail stores and 15 online stores across 23 countries, Hunkemöller needed a technology infrastructure that could scale and keep up with the brand’s growth. Moving from an on-premise system to the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition solution with Google Cloud marks the first milestone in Hunkemöller’s digital transformation journey to become a data-driven company.</p>
  <p>Hunkemöller has an omnichannel sales strategy, selling through its own shops and through wholesale and international franchises. Strong wholesale activities were one of the reasons the company looked to move to the cloud. Hunkemöller wanted a technology infrastructure that could offer flexibility, personalized insights into customers’ shopping behaviors and innovation to position itself for further growth.</p>
  <p>With SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, Hunkemöller is eyeing its next step in its digital transformation journey as it embarks on the implementation of the SAP S/4HANA solution for fashion and vertical business, a version of SAP S/4HANA optimized for the fashion industry. The solution will allow the company to manage its business, from design to wholesale and retail, all on one platform. This will enable Hunkemöller to deliver collections faster on its channels, optimize inventory and cost as well as increase margins.</p>
  <p>“About 75% of our customers are already a member of Hunkemöller,” said Gordon Smit, global IT director, Hunkemöller. “How great would it be if we could offer them an even more personalized experience, for example, by predicting when a customer wants to make a repeat purchase and being able to send the right offer at the right time? Thanks to our current efforts with RISE with SAP, we are ready for that next phase. This is going to be a game changer for our customer experience.”</p>
  <p>Achim Schneider, global head of industry business unit retail and wholesale distribution, SAP, said: “Having worked closely over the past few months and migrating from on-premise to cloud in 48 hours is testament to the strong collaboration that our teams have had. With RISE with SAP now implemented, Hunkemöller is ready to continue building on the strong growth momentum they’ve had, and I’m excited to see them setting new standards in the lingerie market.”</p>

        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced updates to its reporting and receivables financing practices, which will become effective January 1, 2024.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The updates mainly include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The inclusion of share-based compensation (SBC) expenses in non-IFRS results,</li>
    <li>The exclusion of gains/losses from equity investments, mainly driven by SAPPHIRE Ventures, from non-IFRS results,</li>
    <li>The general shift of gains/losses even on smaller divestitures to non-operating income/expense,</li>
    <li>The discontinuation of the company’s receivables financing program (“SAP triggered financing”).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The updates will be reflected for the first time in SAP’s Q1 2024 results, which will be reported on April 22, 2024. While the updates will not impact Q4/FY 2023 results, which will be reported January 24, they will be reflected in SAP’s outlook for 2024 as well as potential updates to its Financial Ambition 2025.</p>
  <p>“By implementing these updates, we hope to further increase the transparency of our operating results, while at the same time reducing short-term noise and volatility,“ said Dominik Asam, CFO and member of the Executive Board of SAP. “Including share-based compensation in our adjusted earnings may be interpreted as a disadvantage in comparison with some of our peers. But we believe recognizing share-based compensation as a genuine expense of running a business is long overdue. We are also convinced that appropriately reflecting it in steering and the incentivization of management will ultimately add economic value.”</p>
  <p>Reflecting the company’s increasing focus on cross- and upselling its broader cloud solution portfolio, SAP also announced its intent to replace the current “SAP S/4HANA Cloud” revenue and current cloud backlog disclosure with a more broadly defined “Cloud ERP Suite” revenue disclosure in 2024.</p>
  <p>Additional background on the announced updates, including a replay of an analyst and investor call hosted by Dominik Asam on Monday, December 18, can be found at SAP’s investor relations website at <a href="https://www.sap.com/investor">www.sap.com/investor</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) announced today it has expanded its integration with financial services company, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal</a>, through the creation of a digital payments plug-in for the PayPal Braintree platform built on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).</p>

  <p>SAP BTP brings together data and analytics, artificial intelligence, application development, automation and integration into one unified environment. Using SAP BTP to build its digital payments processing solution, PayPal now can offer a plug-in for SAP customers to manage payments easily online.</p>
  <p>Many companies in recent years have seen an increase in business and compliance requirements for sending and receiving payments across organizations. As a result, digital wallets, automated clearing houses (ACH) and credit cards are being used for corporate transactions. With the PayPal Braintree Digital Payments connector, SAP customers can use all these funding sources to reduce costs and complexity.</p>
  <p>The PayPal Braintree platform provides SAP customers with more payment choices. It is the only payment platform that supports PayPal, Venmo*, credit and debit cards and popular digital wallets in a single integration. SAP customers who purchased the SAP digital payments add-on can easily connect to PayPal with the plug-in, now available from the <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/DIGITALPAYMENTS">SAP Help Portal site</a>. Customers will benefit from increased efficiency, cost savings, security and transparency, with the plug-in’s smooth integration with SAP software environments certified through the <a href="https://www.sap.com/partners/partner-program/certify-my-solution.html#software">SAP Integration and Certification Center</a>.</p>
  <p>“The payments space has undergone unprecedented disruption over the past couple years, driving companies to embrace more customer-centric, agile payments environments,” said David Bruce, VP, Channel Partnerships, PayPal. “That’s why PayPal teamed up with SAP to develop the PayPal Braintree digital payments app, providing consistent, standard access for SAP customers to connect with PayPal’s payment processing solutions. We hope this is the first of many adaptors built on SAP BTP.”</p>
  <p>Shane Gorman, Chief Operation Officer, Business Technology Platform, SAP, said: “It’s great to see technology companies like PayPal use SAP BTP to develop standard adaptors that our customers and partners can use during an implementation for a consistent customer experience and reduced complexity.”</p>

(AWS), an Amazon.com Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced that SAP HANA Cloud now supports AWS Graviton processors.</h2>
        <p>SAP is extending its cloud-native, in-memory database to AWS Graviton-powered Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to take advantage of AWS’s price, Performance and energy efficiency benefits.</p>

  <p>Thousands of joint customers depend on solutions from AWS and SAP to run their mission-critical business processes. As customers build data-driven, intelligent applications that enable users to make more precise and faster decisions, their <a href="">compute</a> and memory demands grow. These customers require solutions that lower costs without compromising performance and energy efficiency. By choosing to run SAP HANA Cloud on AWS Graviton, SAP can optimize its <a href="">compute</a> costs and allow its customers to benefit from these efficiencies.</p>
  <p>“AWS and SAP have a long history of delivering value in a way that is environmentally responsible,” said Juergen Mueller, Chief Technology Officer and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “This collaboration with AWS on the use of Graviton demonstrates our commitment to reduce the impact of our technologies on the environment while continuing to provide value in the solutions we bring to market.”</p>
  <p>“One of the most visible ways we are innovating is improving the power efficiency of AWS chips,” said David Brown, vice president of Amazon EC2 at AWS. “Our Arm-based AWS Graviton3 processors deliver the best performance per watt of energy use in Amazon EC2, bringing a powerful combination of energy efficiency and price performance to SAP.”</p>
  <p>Arm-based AWS Graviton processors leverage AWS’s extensive expertise in systems design and cloud infrastructure to deliver the best price performance over comparable x86-based instances for a variety of workloads running in Amazon EC2. By migrating SAP HANA Cloud to AWS Graviton-based Amazon EC2 instances, SAP has seen up to 30% better <a href="">compute</a> performance for analytical workloads and lowered its <a href="">compute</a> costs by 15%. And with Graviton3-based instances using up to 60% less energy for the same performance than comparable EC2 instances, SAP can reduce the compute carbon footprint of the workloads of SAP HANA Cloud by an estimated 45%. AWS Graviton3 also supports the latest DDR5 memory, which provides 50% higher memory bandwidth compared to DDR4, to improve the performance of memory-intensive applications.</p>
  <p>As a signatory of Amazon’s The Climate Pledge, SAP is actively working alongside 427 organizations in 38 countries to help reduce carbon emissions and ultimately improve the environment. By choosing to run SAP HANA Cloud on AWS Graviton, SAP can further its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and support efforts to address the climate crisis. SAP and AWS have a longstanding relationship spanning back to 2008, when SAP developed and tested the SAP NetWeaver technology platform – the underpinning of SAP S/4HANA and many other cloud solutions from SAP on AWS. Today, SAP customers continue to use AWS across SAP’s cloud enterprise portfolio through the RISE with SAP solution and SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP <a href="">BTP</a>). In addition, the SAP NS2 Secure Data Cloud service, which is designed for public sector and defense customers with uniquely stringent security and compliance requirements, uses AWS to deliver trusted and secure solutions. Amazon companies, including Twitch, Zappos.com and Zoox Inc., also rely on SAP software on AWS to support their national and global operations.</p>
  <p>SAP plans to expand its use of AWS Graviton in the future to take advantage of the performance gains, cost savings and energy efficiencies.</p>

  <p>Siemens Energy turned to SAP for a single, unified manufacturing execution system landscape that would increase productivity and support standardization across its production plants globally. With Syntax as the implementation partner introducing and moving selected plants to SAP Digital Manufacturing, Siemens Energy will be able to oversee the entire shop floor with fit-for-purpose production dashboards, which provide shop floor operators with guidance and assistance, increasing productivity.</p>
  <p>“The implementation of SAP Digital Manufacturing at our lighthouse plants marks an important milestone in our digital transformation journey,” said Kian Mossanen, Chief Information Officer, Siemens Energy. “This collaboration equips us with the tools needed to further enhance our production capabilities and foster a data-driven culture, allowing us to even better support our customers.”</p>
  <p>SAP Digital Manufacturing will empower the Siemens Energy sites to make fast and critical production decisions based on real-time manufacturing information. With a harmonized solution, the plants will be able to optimize production processes, while low-code plug-ins support shop floor operators during assembly activities.</p>
  <p>“The rollout of our solutions across the production network of Siemens Energy is aimed at supporting the company on its mission of making energy more reliable, affordable and sustainable,” said Sven Mulder, Managing Director, SAP Germany. “Clean energy is one of the most important assets of our time and this can only be achieved collaboratively using real-time data and analytics.”</p>
