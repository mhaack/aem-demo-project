  </div>
  <p>When it comes to sustainability, there are two types of businesses: reactive and resolute.</p>
  <p>In reactive businesses, sustainability is driven by external forces rather than internal strategy. Reactive businesses do what they need to do when they are told to do it – specifically, by customers and investors, according to an SAP Insights survey.</p>
  <p>Resolute businesses, which represent 12% of respondents in the survey, are taking more action on sustainability than everyone else, and their efforts are more likely to have positive effects on the business.</p>
  <p>But what really makes these businesses – which we’ve termed the Resolutes – stand apart is their strong belief that sustainability is directly tied to business competitiveness.</p>
  <p>When something affects competitiveness, it becomes strategic. And when something becomes strategic, companies approach it with more rigor and discipline. They invest in it. And they measure it. They expect to get results, and they expect those results to contribute to their bottom line.</p>
  <p>In fact, the Resolutes are more likely than everyone else to expect a quick return on their sustainability investments. They also report higher revenue growth than other respondents in the survey and say they are more profitable.</p>
  <p>How do they do it? They are more likely than everyone else to be using sustainability as a tool for process improvement and supply chain visibility. But if there’s a (not so) secret sauce to their discipline, it’s their greater satisfaction with their sustainability data.</p>
  <p>Let’s look at the Resolutes in more detail to see what makes them successful.</p>

  <h2 id="lofty-expectations-and-lower-barriers-for-roi">Lofty expectations and lower barriers for ROI.</h2>
  <p>The Resolutes are 26.4% more likely than everyone else to increase their investment in sustainability during the next three years. And with that greater commitment comes greater expectations. They are also 13.8% more likely to expect payback within the next one to three years – the same heated-up period that drives other strategic investments.</p>
  <p>The rigor that the Resolutes apply to their sustainability investments goes hand in hand with their ability to get results. They are 7.0% less likely to say that lack of funding is a barrier to sustainability and 7.3% less likely to experience problems proving ROI.</p>

  <h2 id="sustainability-has-more-positive-effects-on-the-business">Sustainability has more positive effects on the business.</h2>
  <p>With elevated expectations for ROI comes expectations for other kinds of results. And the Resolutes see their sustainability efforts contributing in specific ways to their overall business competitiveness. They are more than twice as likely to say that sustainability contributes to positive business outcomes, such as increased revenue, profitability, and growth. Sustainability also helps them improve the quality of their products and services, make their processes more efficient, and cut costs.</p>

  <h2 id="data-is-crucial">Data is crucial.</h2>
  <p>How does a company gain rigor and discipline over any investment and achieve positive business outcomes? With data. The Resolutes are more likely than other respondents to report that they are completely satisfied with their data.</p>
  <p>One plausible reason for this satisfaction: they’re trying harder. They are measuring seven of nine common sustainability areas – including energy consumption and emissions, air pollution, and resource availability – more often than everyone else. They are also more likely to be collecting their data using direct measurement rather than assumptions and estimates.</p>

  <h2 id="a-competitive-outlook-is-the-key">A competitive outlook is the key.</h2>
  <p>We found a strong connection between respondents’ views on sustainability and competitiveness, their satisfaction with data, and their growth. That is, those who see a moderate or strong positive relationship between sustainability and competitiveness (including the Resolutes) are more likely to be satisfied with their data. They also achieved greater revenue and profit growth in 2022 compared to respondents who see a weak relationship, a negative relationship, or no relationship between their sustainability efforts and their company’s competitiveness.</p>

  <p>We’ve looked at the characteristics of a Resolute company. So, what actions do you need to take to join the fold? Here are some suggestions:</p>
  <h2 id="think-of-sustainability-as-a-new-element-of-business-strategy">Think of sustainability as a new element of business strategy.</h2>
  <p>The end goal for the Resolutes isn’t just to make business processes more sustainable; it’s to make the business more competitive. Continuing to treat sustainability as tangential to business strategy will hurt businesses over the long term.</p>
  <p>Just look at IT. There was a time when computers were dismissed as expensive typewriters. Today, IT isn’t just strategic – it’s often the product or service itself. It’s time to think of sustainability in the same way.</p>
  <h2 id="bring-rigor-to-sustainability-investments">Bring rigor to sustainability investments.</h2>
  <p>The Resolutes treat sustainability just as they would any other strategic investment: they set targets for positive returns within a brief period – and they appear to be getting them.</p>
  <p>Taking a reactive approach by basing sustainability efforts on constantly shifting customer and investor demands destroys any rigor. Without discipline, companies may end up with a lot of one-off efforts and duplication – and less certainty about whether sustainability investments help the bottom line.</p>

        <h1 id="how-the-most-resilient-companies-are-different">How the Most Resilient Companies Are Different</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We think of resilient companies as being good at responding to risks. But what about <em>taking</em> risks?</p>
  <p>Turns out they’re pretty good at that, too.</p>
  <p>The most resilient companies in a survey by SAP Insights are more likely to see intelligent technologies such as AI and blockchain – considered risky by pretty much everybody – supplying their biggest opportunities for growth.</p>
  <p>These companies are also experimenting much more with process change – another risky proposition, considering that resistance to change is woven into our DNA.</p>
  <p>Why do they do it? Because risks are less risky for these companies.</p>
  <p>If you were a toddler about to jump into a pool for the first time and someone who had never dropped you awaited you there with arms outstretched, you would be a lot more likely to take that jump than you would with swim fins alone. Resilient companies are the same way. They have a foundation of strength and reliability that makes taking risks (including innovation) easier and (usually) more rewarding.</p>
  <p>The top 25% of companies in the survey (let’s call them “the Resilients”) are better at responding to problems – such as market dips, labor shortages, and disrupted operations – that can occur at any time. They are also better prepared for what might happen in the future. Furthermore, they are more likely to have access to the data they need to be confident in their decisions. (See “Our resilience formula.”)</p>
  <p>These strengths don’t just reduce risks and improve the prospects for innovation: the Resilients also tend to expect more revenue growth than other respondents.</p>

  <p>We told you that the Resilients are the top 25% most resilient companies from our survey. But if you really must see our work, here’s the formula:</p>
  <p>We calculated a resiliency score for each respondent based on their answers to our questions about current resilience, future resilience, and data accessibility capabilities. For each question, we graded the responses on a scale of 0–5 (with 0 equal to “no capability”) and calculated an average.</p>
  <p>We added the scores for current resilience and future resilience, then multiplied the sum by the data accessibility score to get an overall resiliency score. We chose to multiply the data accessibility score because when people have access to the right data it amplifies their decision-making ability.</p>

  <h2 id="the-resilients-have-a-foundation-of-strength--and-it-pays">The Resilients have a foundation of strength – and it pays</h2>
  <p>First, let’s understand the three characteristics that give the Resilients their strength.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resilience now.</strong> They are more than twice as likely as other respondents to say they are “very effective” in nine capabilities needed to respond to problems such as disruptions to operations that can occur at any time (see Figure 1a).</li>
    <li><strong>Resilience later.</strong> The Resilients are nearly twice as likely to say they “strongly agree” that they’re ready to respond to challenges that could affect them in the future, such as staying current with technology and responding to changes in customer demand or preferences (see Figure 1b).</li>
    <li><strong>A talent for data.</strong> Finally, the Resilients are twice as likely to “strongly agree” that they have access to the data needed to make decisions: for example, to find and analyze potential risks, plan for the future, and make operational improvements. Their talent for using data suggests they know resiliency isn’t just about knowing how to suffer and survive. It’s about knowing when disruptions will occur, and responding in ways that will make them less vulnerable next time (see Figure 1c).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Resilience pays.</strong> Now we can see how their strength pays off. The Resilients are more likely than the rest of the respondents to say their companies increased revenues in 2022. Though we can’t draw a causal connection, it’s probably no accident that being more resilient today and tomorrow, and having better access to data for decision-making, correlates with more success.</p>

  <h2 id="resilience-makes-risk-taking-easier">Resilience makes risk-taking easier</h2>
  <p>From their position of strength, the Resilients can afford to take more risks than the rest of the respondents. For example, their attitude toward technology and their pursuit of process change shows a greater potential for innovation.</p>
  <p><strong>Resilients are better at leaving the past behind.</strong> Think coming up with new products and services is the hardest part of innovation? Perhaps even tougher is leaving successful products or business models behind in pursuit of new ones. Although all respondents named this as one of their top innovation barriers, the Resilients have an easier time saying goodbye than other respondents.</p>

  <p><strong>They’re more ambitious about process change.</strong> Process innovation can be every bit as important to growth as new products and services. And the Resilients tend to be doing more than everyone else. Most often, they said they were working on five improvements, while everyone else most often said they were working on three (See Figure 5a). As a result, they are also significantly more likely to be targeting a wide range of outcomes from process improvement: everything from increased automation to sourcing more ideas from customers and partners (See Figure 5b).</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-join-the-resilients">How to join the Resilients</h2>
  <p><strong>Perfection is not required.</strong> A big first step you can take to joining the Resilient club is to excel at one thing. Respondents who say their companies are highly skilled at any single capability in the categories of current resilience, future resilience, or data access tend to rate themselves better across all the other capabilities compared to those who say they aren’t excellent at any. One possible reason: scenario planning processes followed in one area can be adapted across functions with incremental adjustments.</p>
  <p>The Resilients are far ahead of the rest of the respondents in their ability to deal with problems in the moment and anticipate those in the future. But they are far from perfect. The Resilients gave themselves the highest ratings on at least four out of nine current preparedness capabilities and six out of 11 future preparedness capabilities. Beyond that minimum, having more highly rated capabilities didn’t significantly improve respondents’ resiliency scores. The entry fee to the Resilient club may not be as high as you imagine.</p>

  <p><strong>But investing in data is essential.</strong> Remember that one of the characteristics of the Resilients is their high degree of access to data. You can win as many black belts in Six Sigma (or its derivatives) as you want. But all that expertise and effort will be muted at best and wasted at worst if you lack the data to know how your current processes are working. Without that insight, it’s more difficult to know which processes most need fixing to make your company more resilient.</p>

  <p>How does a business get better at something?</p>
  <p>If the goal is specific, such as designing new products, you might carve out a group of experts who can focus without distractions.<br><br>If the ambition is broad, such as making the business environmentally sustainable, the opposite is true. Improvement comes from spreading skills, resources, and responsibility as widely as possible across the company.</p>

  <p>Does Your Business Have a Talent for Sustainability?</p>
  <p>Survey respondents say that sustainability is important to their strategy – and their future. That will require making sustainability a talent that is second nature to everyone in the company.</p>

  <p>Here’s why businesses need to become talented in sustainability: besides the obvious world-saving implications, more than 60% of respondents to an SAP Insights survey of 6,669 business leaders in 40 countries say that sustainability has a moderate or strong effect on long-term competitiveness and profitability.</p>
  <p>Saying that sustainability is tied to the success or failure of a company is a pretty good argument for getting better at it. For that to happen, top management needs to make sustainability part of how the business defines success so that employees understand why they need to incorporate it into how they think and what they do.</p>

  <p>Sustainability has to become second nature – a talent everyone practices without needing reminders. For example, serving customers and spending the company’s money wisely are ingrained in us all; if they aren’t, the company is in big trouble.</p>
  <p>The good news is that according to the survey, companies are making progress on becoming talented in sustainability. Here’s why: despite economic uncertainty, businesses are investing more – and more consistently – in sustainability compared to a year ago.</p>
  <p>Almost 90% say sustainability informs their business decisions. They’re also building sustainability into their business processes.</p>

  <h2 id="companies-are-making-progress">Companies are making progress.</h2>
  <p>However, as with any broad-based business talent, money, will, and strategic importance are not enough to guarantee success. Being good at sustainability requires an environmental impact strategy, which many respondents say they lack.</p>
  <p>It also needs a variety of leaders to be accountable for success, which respondents report is still nascent in their companies. And sustainability depends on high-quality, accurate data that they don’t yet have.</p>
  <p>So becoming good at sustainability isn’t going to be easy. No surprise there. But the survey findings show how companies are improving.</p>

  <p>87% of respondents say that sustainability measurement and reporting on environmental issues inform their companies’ strategic and operational decisions to a strong or moderate degree – that's a 15% increase from last year.</p>
  <h2 id="companies-are-feeling-more-heat-from-customers">Companies are feeling more heat from customers.</h2>
  <p>Customer demand as a motivation for business sustainability efforts increased sevenfold year over year. It now ranks equally with other top motivators, including revenue and profit growth, chances to develop new or improved offerings, and stronger societal approval for the business.</p>
  <h2 id="sustainability-is-more-important-to-financial-results">Sustainability is more important to financial results.</h2>
  <p>There’s no better way to make a practice second nature than to <a href="/research/bridging-the-gap-between-sustainability-and-financial-metrics">connect it with making more money</a>. In fact, more respondents this year see the environment having a role in their financial results.</p>

  <p>59% believe environmental issues are, or will soon be, material to business results – a 67% increase over last year.</p>
  <p>We can’t say for sure, but we think that as sustainability becomes part of important processes, such as developing new products and services, the financial result will become more apparent.</p>
  <h2 id="investment-in-sustainability-has-hit-overdrive">Investment in sustainability has hit overdrive.</h2>
  <p>Sustainability might as well be the hottest stock on the market with so many companies piling on so quickly. Despite persistent supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and inflation, the percentage of businesses investing in the environment for the first time has quintupled since 2021. More importantly, most businesses that have already invested aren’t letting up.</p>

  </p>
  <p>The survey found that the number of businesses assigning accountability for sustainability to more than one leader increased 26% from last year. Meanwhile, 19% fewer businesses than last year left sustainability in the hands of one leader.</p>
  <h2 id="sustainability-efforts-show-signs-of-growing-pains">Sustainability efforts show signs of growing pains.</h2>
  <p>What happens when you try to do anything of consequence that requires participation from across the company? You start needing more of everything: more money, more expertise, a greater need to prove ROI.</p>
  <p>None of these are good problems to have, but they do signal that businesses are thinking about sustainability as a company-wide project.</p>
  <p>The good news?</p>
  <p>Some barriers appear to be falling. Respondents this year were less likely to flag measuring results on the environment, embedding sustainability into processes, and <a href="/resources/profitable-purpose-the-future-of-business-sustainability">aligning actions with the overall business strategy</a> as issues. These changes suggest that companies are progressing beyond the earliest stages.</p>
  <h2 id="respondents-yearn-for-a-company-wide-environmental-impact-strategy">Respondents yearn for a company-wide environmental impact strategy.</h2>
  <p>The absence of a company-wide strategy for understanding and managing environmental effects both inside and outside the business is now one of the top barriers preventing action.</p>
  <p>We suspect that at the heart of this problem is a lack of quality data and difficulty in measuring all the different ways that sustainability affects the business.</p>
  <p>Another issue, we believe, is that companies are struggling with how to incorporate sustainability into the larger business strategy.</p>
  <p>To become good at sustainability, companies need a business strategy with sustainability at its core.</p>
  <h2 id="sustainability-data-is-getting-better-but-its-not-good-enough">Sustainability data is getting better, but it’s not good enough.</h2>
  <p>Improving sustainability requires measurement, which of course means data. Respondents in 2022 are more likely to be satisfied with their environmental sustainability data than they were last year. But there’s still a long way to go.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Only 23% of businesses are completely satisfied. The rest point to gaps in the sources, quality, and scope of their data as their top dissatisfactions.</p>
  <h2 id="sustainability-features-in-long-term-success">Sustainability features in long-term success.</h2>
  <p>For any business to have a future, it needs to adapt to changing conditions over time. As respondents <a href="/blogs/future-of-sustainable-operations">tie sustainability more tightly to operations across the company</a>, it’s natural that they would also see it becoming more important to profits and to activities that fall under the umbrella of competitiveness, such as delivering value and maintaining competitive differentiation. The survey findings illustrate the point:</p>

  <p>When we asked more than 11,000 senior executives from around the world about their priorities for revenue growth, operational efficiency, and risk management, they said they see a direct link between innovation and increasing revenues.</p>
  <p>They are exploiting that link by investing in new or more sustainable products and services along with improving customer experiences. Improving cost control and making operations more sustainable are their top strategies for bolstering operations. To battle risk, they are strengthening their supply chains, avoiding damage to their reputations, and protecting against cybersecurity attacks.</p>
  <p>These findings show how companies can remain competitive: by transforming business processes to support innovation and flexibility. Learn more about our findings.</p>

  <p>Though cavepeople wouldn’t recognize much of what goes on in the world today, they would understand our need to learn at work and improve our skills. Without constantly honing their abilities to hunt and gather in collaborative teams, they would have starved, and we wouldn’t be here.</p>
  <p>Until recently, much of the training and development offered by corporations would have perplexed early <em>Homo sapiens</em>, with a focus on teaching specific skills for static roles rather than the more human-centered skills that have held us together for eons.</p>
  <p>Corporate training departments are now rediscovering their hunter-gatherer roots. For example, the abilities to communicate effectively, empathize, and reframe challenges are coming back to the fore.</p>
  <p>For Learning and Development (L&#x26;D) pros, the mission is shifting to nurturing talent that does what machines, automation, and AI cannot.</p>
  <p>But before you can plan for the future, you need a clear view of the present. Chief human resources officers (CHROs) and chief learning officers need to get a handle on the forces – some visible, some hidden – that exist today, and that will play a large role in shaping the future.</p>
  <p>One thing is clear: The future of corporate learning is tightly tied to the future of work. As easily quantifiable, repetitive work is becoming more automated, training and learning are shifting to cover more human-centered abilities that bots can’t easily duplicate.</p>
  <p>But humans aren’t ready for the shift. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/mind-the-skills-gap">A vast majority</a> of employers say they have a skills gap in their workforces. This is especially true for the skills that can’t be automated, with collaboration, leadership, proactive thinking, and adaptability leading the list, <a href="https://www.talentlms.com/blog/reskilling-upskilling-training-statistics/">say</a> both employers and employees.</p>

  <p>This isn’t just about saying goodbye to single-focus careers crowned with a gold watch at retirement. Rather, the offerings from many L&#x26;D programs are too focused on skills that are highly perishable under the heat of automation. And they don’t adequately account for the big shifts happening in the way work is done.</p>
  <p>A case in point: Increases in remote and gig work have accelerated because of improved network technologies and the threat of COVID-19. Fewer in-person interactions, however, weaken social bonds among employees. That threatens L&#x26;D professionals’ ability to teach employees the human-centered skills that are becoming more essential. Further, companies that rely on contractors may feel less motivation to train and develop them because they are not “full employees.”</p>
  <p>Some companies are also questioning whether the current entry pass to the corporate job market – the university degree – is necessary, especially as the cost of education <a href="https://www.insider.com/cost-of-college-countries-around-the-world-2018-6">rises</a> in many countries. If people choose to forgo higher education because of costs, CHROs and L&#x26;D leaders will need to create programs that prepare workers without degrees to succeed in the corporate world. Otherwise, companies will face increasing talent shortages and miss out on valuable hires.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, technology is no longer just an assistant to learning; it’s also the teacher. Advances in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) compress years of real-world experiences into targeted, immersive virtual programs that let employees test their skills without the real-world consequences of failure. AI lets leaders insert learning into live work processes, prompting employees with content at the moment it’s needed rather than in the classroom. L&#x26;D leaders will have to balance the right mixture of in-person and virtual learning experiences.</p>
  <p>Not addressing these issues will worsen longstanding problems for L&#x26;D leaders. With ROI difficult to <a href="https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/2020/02/5-faqs-about-measuring-the-roi-of-training-and-development#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20ROI%20of,between%204%25%20and%20353%25">measure,</a> executives often fear that traditional training programs deliver <a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-on-corporate-training-and-what-they-mean-for-your-companys-future">minimal results.</a> At the same time, L&#x26;D budgets are shrinking and learners lack time for training – and often, <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/amp/learning-solutions/images/wlr21/pdf/LinkedIn-Learning_Workplace-Learning-Report-2021-EN-1.pdf">clarity and support</a> from their managers on learning goals.</p>

  <p>Today we have instant virtual access to nearly all information, which changes how skills are taught. Why memorize when you can Google? We have less need for rote learning of facts or knowing how to multiply big numbers in our heads.</p>
  <p>Machines – computers and smartphones, chiefly – extend the reach and portability of unlimited information, enabling us to bring learning into many different situations and contexts. Technology supports pinging employees with learning content that is contextual and timely. It also enhances mobility: Employees can take courses at home, on the bus to work, or on a beach.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, as AI and robots become more capable, they’ll continue to change the work that people do. Our careers will no longer be defined or bound by what we know. Unlimited information bursts from every laptop and smartphone. L&#x26;D leaders will need to focus even more on teaching employees how to adapt to the constant expansion of specialized machine intelligence.</p>

  <h2 id="megadriver-2-the-network-has-become-a-dominant-organizing-principle">Megadriver 2: The network has become a dominant organizing principle</h2>
  <p>Tremendous gains in the ability to link computers and people together at ever-decreasing cost have made it easy for employees to create connections with their peers both inside and outside the company. This has increased learning opportunities since the more connections that employees have, the more information they can access and the more they can learn from others.</p>
  <p>Improved remote working technologies such as the ubiquitous Zoom have accelerated the shift to virtual networks, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. As <a href="/resources/remote-work-new-normal">remote work becomes normalized</a>, employees will increasingly depend on digital learning content.</p>
  <p>Rather than rely on employees to find that content themselves, L&#x26;D leaders are taking on the role of learning emcee to match employees with the resources that best fit their needs. The challenge will be keeping on top of everything out there, because good learning content can be anywhere now – LinkedIn seminars, DIY videos on YouTube, and online learning platforms such as Coursera.</p>
  <p>The two megadrivers form a shared foundation for the four drivers that will play a direct role in the future of corporate learning.</p>

  <h2 id="driver-1-work-is-becoming-more-human-centered-less-repetitive">Driver 1: Work is becoming more human-centered, less repetitive</h2>
  <p>Automation has already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/automation-labor-market-wage-inequality-middle-class-jobs-study-2021-6">eliminated</a> entire classes of jobs. The doomsday scenario is of an entirely machine-driven economy with humans left out. But humans are already proving their resilience. Work is shifting to tasks that require human-centered skills, including collaboration, complex reasoning, empathy, <a href="/resources/human-factors-build-resilience">resilience</a>, and creativity.</p>
  <p>Not all skills that make us human are innate, and even those that are need further development. Nurturing those skills isn’t the same as teaching people technical skills. By creating workspaces that encourage experimentation and interaction, organizations can shore up the human capabilities that are crucial for innovation – and that companies need to keep thriving.</p>
  <h3 id="the-future-of-work-is-happening-concurrently">The future of work is happening concurrently</h3>
  <p>Experts identify four effects that automation and AI could have on the future of work. However, these effects are not mutually exclusive. Rather than a zero-sum game in which one outcome becomes dominant, each is developing concurrently (see Figure 1).</p>

  <p><em>Figure 1</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large-scale job losses<br>One predicted outcome is major job loss from automation and advancing use of AI. This would result in an overall erosion of work – whether it’s complete job loss or simply a decrease in human participation, control, and discretion. Workers’ fear of being replaced by machines is already widespread and, in some roles, justified. The World Economic Forum, for one, has sounded the alarm that more than 1 billion people will need reskilling by 2030 due to job replacement.</li>
    <li>Augmented work<br>Another school of thought says jobs will be augmented or supported by AI rather than replaced outright. While automation will expand in every job, full automation will be low because AI will not be able to replicate all job skills. However, people will still need frequent training to work with these new augmentation and support tools.</li>
    <li>Large-scale job gains<br>There are also those who see the advances in technology creating far more jobs than those lost to automation. However, employees won’t be able to simply hop right into these new jobs; they’ll need new skills. Some companies are trying to get ahead of these changes; Amazon is creating a program to upskill 100,000 U.S. employees for in-demand technical and non-technical jobs by 2025. Meanwhile, many workers understand the imperative to acquire new skills but often don’t know where to begin, especially if employers don’t clarify what skills they want.</li>
    <li>Business as usual<br>Finally, there are some who think the potential of AI and automation as job destroyers is overblown. They question the impact on jobs overall, especially on those that require complex interactions both internally and with customers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="how-the-four-effects-are-playing-out">How the four effects are playing out</h3>
  <p>Today we’re seeing evidence of all four effects at work. Automation continues, and it’s displacing workers in jobs that require rote, repetitive tasks. At the same time, however, the type and volume of work that is being <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/03/ai-should-augment-human-intelligence-not-replace-it">augmented</a> rather than replaced outright is also growing.</p>
  <p>For example, <a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/customer-service-is-the-profit-center-of-the-future.html-future/">call center employees</a> are seeing more of their rote tasks, such as initial customer contact, taken over by machines. But the core skills required for the role, such as empathy and complex problem-solving, are not being replaced. Rather, they are being augmented, with software to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2019/06/13/using-ai-to-augment-customer-service-agents/?sh=15b0775e14a8">help</a> employees find information and prompt them with suggestions for action and learning. Meanwhile, although many jobs in manufacturing have been lost to machines, others have endured and have been augmented by them.</p>
  <p>Automation is also replacing some desk-based jobs while creating new ones that require both technical and human skills. However, there is often significant overlap between these new roles and what used to be called entry-level or lower-skilled roles. This trend calls into question the conventional wisdom that a university degree should be the minimum bar of entry to a corporate career (see Driver 2).</p>
  <p>There is a subtle shift even in roles that still seem like business as usual, such as middle and executive management. Machine augmentation and technology virtualization employed at the lower levels of the organization are changing how employees are supervised. There’s less need for direct monitoring – often, technology can do that – and more need for coaching and mentoring. Increasingly, the most respected and successful managers and executives are those who practice human-centered skills and coach their employees to develop them.</p>
  <p>In both desk-based and deskless jobs, there is increasing demand for employees who excel at uniquely human skills. This means that however work evolves, L&#x26;D leaders will be adding a heavy emphasis on <a href="https://www.teachthought.com/the-future-of-learning/13-likely-realities-the-future-learning/?9">new primary skills</a> for employees, including <a href="https://trainingmag.com/why-emotional-intelligence-is-a-critical-skill-for-the-future-workforce/">emotional intelligence</a>, creativity, critical thinking, empathy, and <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/future-workforce/transforming-learning">inclusivity</a>.</p>
  <p>Increasingly, the most respected and successful managers and executives are those who practice human-centered skills and coach their employees to develop them.</p>

  <h2 id="driver-2-corporate-learning-is-reaching-an-expanded-pool-of-people">Driver 2: Corporate learning is reaching an expanded pool of people</h2>
  <p>In the industrial economy, the overriding mindset was to improve efficiency and increase the pace and scale of production. Jobs were highly structured so that people could be swapped in and out with minimal cost and disruption. That approach viewed education and training – including university degrees – as systems for filling specific roles that changed little over time.</p>
  <p>As work becomes more human-centered, that industrial-age view of education is getting flipped. Not only does the evolving nature of work require people to continually acquire new knowledge and skills, there’s <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-employers-must-stop-requiring-college-degrees-for-middle-skill-jobs">evidence</a> that the skills used in many jobs that require a university degree overlap heavily with jobs that don’t. In other words, there’s a paper barrier between lower- and higher-paying jobs that shouldn’t be there and that shuts out talented workers who didn’t go to university. In the United States, the higher education filter is “self-harm for the economy, racially and ethically,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/technology/work-skills-upward-mobility.html">says</a> Byron Auguste, chief executive of Opportunity@Work.</p>
  <p>In other words, there’s a paper barrier between lower- and higher-paying jobs that shouldn’t be there and that shuts out talented workers who didn’t go to university.</p>
  <h3 id="university-degrees-may-not-be-required">University degrees may not be required</h3>
  <p>Continuing to make university degrees the bar for corporate employment all but assures future talent shortages. Instead, focus is shifting to direct training for people in the skills they need to do their jobs. European governments and companies have long provided <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-09-27/what-europe-can-teach-the-us-about-apprenticeships">robust</a> technical education in lieu of requiring university degrees. These programs have usually focused on trades such as plumbing or mechanical repair, but their scope is changing. Tech companies, for example, are creating courses designed for non-university-bound people to fill IT roles. Former IBM CEO Ginni Rometty coined a term for these employees: “new collar.”</p>
  <p>Free learning models created by the tech giants do good for the community while giving people who otherwise would not get through the door an entrée to a promising career. For instance, Google’s new <a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/google-plan-disrupt-college-degree-university-higher-education-certificate-project-management-data-analyst.html">Career Certificates</a> let job seekers find employment quickly after completing a six-month course. Microsoft has an <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/06/30/microsoft-launches-initiative-to-help-25-million-people-worldwide-">initiative</a> to help people worldwide acquire digital skills and low-cost certifications. And if, after taking its courses, you don’t get a job within six months, <a href="https://perell.com/podcast/austen-allred/">Lambda School</a> will refund your tuition. As the new collar trend picks up steam, companies around the world could look to apprenticeships, certifications, and two-year degrees to find more employees.</p>
  <h3 id="connecting-with-a-new-pool-of-workers">Connecting with a new pool of workers</h3>
  <p>As higher education requirements loosen, companies will gain access to a vast pool of potential employees who they previously would have overlooked. Some organizations, especially larger ones with more discretionary L&#x26;D budget, have programs for new and entry-level hires that also target underserved communities. In organizations where money is scarcer, L&#x26;D executives nevertheless are facing pressure to create similar programs that stay within budget constraints.</p>
  <p>The good news is that unlimited information and ubiquitous networks make this work easier. As the <a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/is-your-business-ready-for-the-new-collar-worker.htmlr-worker/">new collar concept</a> takes hold, for example, online certification programs can be created at low cost. At the same time, these programs have the potential to reach anyone with a computer connection.</p>

  <h2 id="driver-3-ubiquitous-contextual-and-experiential-learning-is-feasible">Driver 3: Ubiquitous contextual and experiential learning is feasible</h2>
  <p>The reach of computer networks continues to expand, and the costs to produce and integrate experiential learning continue to plummet. Together, these trends make powerful new models for learning possible. Technologies such as AI-supported AR, VR, and high-fidelity simulation are already pushing this type of learning forward.</p>
  <p>More specifically, the confluence of several trends is making ubiquitous contextual and experiential learning feasible.</p>
  <h3 id="learning-is-becoming-more-contextual">Learning is becoming more contextual</h3>
  <p>Most skills or behaviors learned in a classroom are forgotten soon after unless they are reinforced. To address this issue, learning is increasingly happening when it’s most needed. By embedding learning into the specific context of a work process, such as giving call center operators <a href="https://techmonitor.ai/technology/ai-and-automation/ai-in-call-centre">real-time advice</a> during difficult conversations with customers, the learning <a href="https://rapidlearninginstitute.com/blog/context-dependent-learning/">sticks</a> more easily and can be reinforced over time.</p>
  <p>AI will play an important role in targeting these sorts of helpful interruptions. The technology can learn when and how best to connect employees with content, minimizing the <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/where-companies-go-wrong-with-learning-and-development">likelihood</a> that people will forget what they’ve learned by the time they need to apply it.</p>
  <p>But timing isn’t everything. The environment where learning happens also matters a lot. Classrooms take learning out of the work environment; immersive experiences put it back in. In a growing number of cases, VR and AR simulations deliver convincing alternatives to real-world situations.</p>
  <p>Classic examples are airline pilot and military training, in which elaborate immersive environments are realistic enough to the brain and body to elicit the same reactions that would occur in the real world. However, due to the enormous cost and complexity of these environments, they have only been justified in areas where they help avoid costly or even disastrous real-world mistakes.</p>
  <h3 id="employees-prefer-the-metaverse-to-the-whiteboard">Employees prefer the metaverse to the whiteboard</h3>
  <p>With the exponential drop in network and information costs, technologies such as VR, AR, and gaming software are now becoming vital tools for immersive experiential learning at scale. For example, Walmart <a href="https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2021/03/23/case-study-walmart-embraces-immersive-learning/">uses</a> a VR-based platform at nearly all of its 4,700 store locations to simulate important experiences for new store employees, including the most stressful day of the year: Black Friday. Employees who take the VR training say they prefer it to classroom learning, and their retention of training concepts is higher. It also helps Walmart save money by compressing into short sessions what would otherwise take weeks or even years of real-world experience in stores to duplicate.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, gamification of learning through the <a href="https://www.thehrdirector.com/features/learning-development/gamification-fill-corporate-learning-gap-created-covid-19/">development</a> of “serious” games is rapidly expanding, drawing on the broader entertainment-based gaming industry. For example, PepsiCo <a href="https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2021/02/16/case-study-pepsico-leverages-minecraft-for-lean-six-sigma-training/">uses</a> the virtual world of Minecraft, a video game platform, for Lean Six Sigma training. Black Belt PepsiCo trainer Marco Rodriguez Tapia worked with his then 11-year-old son Alexander to create a world in Minecraft that simulates a PepsiCo plant. Trainees could practice problem-solving and complete productivity challenges while building simulated pallets using virtual blocks. As at Walmart, PepsiCo found training in a virtual environment to be more engaging for learners than a traditional classroom.</p>
  <p>However, not all learning can happen virtually, for an obvious reason: Not every work experience can be duplicated convincingly – yet. But the twin drivers of dirt-cheap processing and exponential increases in computing power will keep the sophistication of virtual contextual learning growing at a brisk clip, with ubiquitous demand for better gaming experiences turbocharging development and adoption.</p>

  <h2 id="driver-4-different-aspects-of-life-are-blending-under-one-digital-roof">Driver 4: Different aspects of life are blending under one “digital roof”</h2>
  <p>The walls separating family life, play, work, and learning are breaking down. No longer separated into distinct physical spaces, these activities are blending together under a single digital roof.</p>
  <p>Network-based changes to the work environment, including the rise of remote and gig work, are driving a shift from top-down to network-oriented and peer-based learning models.</p>
  <p>The near ubiquity of low- or no-cost platforms such as LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok under the digital roof is creating explosive growth in user-generated learning content. A bottom-up, collaborative learning <a href="https://360learning.com/blog/training-needs-analysis/">approach</a>, in which everyone at a company can play a role in course creation, provides a decentralized and democratized <a href="https://360learning.com/blog/changing-corporate-training/">way</a> to develop and distribute learning content. The digital roof gives us the Netflix of learning – personalized, entertaining, on-demand.</p>
  <p>The challenge for L&#x26;D executives is tracking what employees are doing and ensuring that the content is relevant and correct. One way to reduce the noise is proactively identifying content that serves both the needs of employees and the learning goals of the organization.</p>

  <h3 id="bonding-with-external-workers">Bonding with external workers</h3>
  <p>The digital roof enables the gig economy, increases in contract work, and the shift to remote work. But as we live more of our lives under that digital roof, the personal bonds between us become weaker.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22651953/americans-gig-independent-workers-benefits-vacation-health-care-inequality">explosion</a> in temporary contingent workers who do not receive corporate benefits raises questions about how businesses will train and <a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/oth/g-benefits-cultivate-your-external-talent/index.html">develop</a> these workers. Organizations have been split as to whether to include contractors in internal training and development initiatives. This leaves external workers, at times, without access to the same opportunities to develop their skills. And the absence of common learning experiences can widen the cultural divide between external workers and the employees they work with daily.</p>
  <p>However, the distinctions between external workers and internal employees are beginning to fall away, given that increases in decentralized employment will likely continue. Providing experiences that gig workers value – everything from learning experiences to better communications – will encourage successful external workers to come back for multiple gigs or perhaps pursue full-time employment.</p>

  <p>In a decentralized employment future, both internal and external workers will <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends/2021/workforce-trends-2020.html">increasingly</a> be expected to take ownership of their development. New tools are appearing under the digital roof to help.</p>
  <p>For example, coaching and leadership development have usually been available only at the upper echelons of an organization, due to the time- and labor-intensive nature of this type of training. Now apps like <a href="https://www.betterup.com/demo-request?utm_camp=7012J000001FLrA&#x26;utm_term=betterup&#x26;utm_campaign=Brand+%5BSearch%5D&#x26;utm_source=adwords&#x26;utm_medium=ppc&#x26;hsa_acc=2392577503&#x26;hsa_cam=13352651720&#x26;hsa_grp=123575564872&#x26;hsa_ad=534903171071&#x26;hsa_src=g&#x26;hsa_tgt=kwd-390370419962&#x26;hsa_kw=betterup&#x26;hsa_mt=p&#x26;hsa_net=adwords&#x26;hsa_ver=3&#x26;gclid=Cj0KCQjwt-6LBhDlARIsAIPRQcLaEw1kLP3AYONzAZNahsKiOP4LuSFbu4BaSjMi5-SuBcaWrEsa_2EaAkWSEALw_wcB">BetterUp</a> can help democratize those opportunities by matching individuals with <a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/apprentice-opportunity-using-old-model-to-recruit-fresh-talent.htmlh-talent/">mentors or coaches</a> in a highly personalized and contextually relevant way.</p>
  <p>Of course, much still depends on the quality of the human coach. But the digital roof opens the possibility of broadening leadership development to cover all levels of the organization and all job categories. People with leadership potential can be spotted earlier in their careers and developed at a lower cost. For L&#x26;D departments, this means better ROI on program investments.</p>
  <h3 id="learning-for-now-and-the-future">Learning for now and the future</h3>
  <p>The drivers of the future of corporate learning reveal an ironic and challenging shift: Even as machines replace employees or augment their roles, the most important element of change is in what humans can do. L&#x26;D professionals help employees maximize the skills they need to prepare for future evolutions of their jobs.</p>
  <p>But merely offering courses on collaboration or conflict resolution won’t cut it. Improving employees’ skills requires a more subtle approach. By putting learning cues into the right context, people will learn to maximize their unique abilities more quickly and retain the knowledge they need to do their jobs more effectively.</p>
  <p>Not all employees are ready for these changes. Our education systems are still set up to prepare students for lifetime careers in a particular specialty. With the rise of remote and gig work and with skills going out of date faster than ever, careers have become moving targets.</p>
  <p>As work becomes more decentralized, L&#x26;D professionals have an opportunity to zig where others zag. Many companies are struggling with how (and whether) to develop an increasingly dispersed and contract-based workforce. There is no doubt that as the work-from-home and gig economies expand, more companies will leave training and development to individuals. Companies that integrate training for external workers with their in-house people will see better ROI and attract more and better employees.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, technology isn’t simply erasing jobs. AI and machine learning are creating new roles and helping employees improve their productivity through augmentation. And as the primacy of the university degree as a hiring qualification continues to erode, a wider pool of candidates is coming into focus, potentially expanding access to desk-based jobs for people at the bottom of the economic ladder while helping companies address emerging talent shortages.</p>
  <p>The challenges that L&#x26;D professionals have always faced are not going away. Executives will be skeptical about new forms of learning if ROI is difficult to measure. Learning and development budgets are likely to continue <a href="https://transformationleader.de/corporate-learning-zahlen-und-statistiken/">shrinking</a>, leaving L&#x26;D functions with even more limited resources. And learners aren’t likely to have more time.</p>
  <p>But taken together, the drivers we’ve discussed are changing the mission of L&#x26;D professionals and making their work more essential. Now more than ever, L&#x26;D can be the thread that ties dispersed workforces together and preserves a sense of shared experience and community in companies. L&#x26;D leaders have an opportunity to change the negative perception of L&#x26;D that may exist in the executive suite while helping those on the front lines who are feeling disconnected and those in the community who are locked out entirely.</p>
  <p>We’re in the midst of a once-in-generation change in the ways people work. L&#x26;D has the opportunity to help make it a change for the better.</p>

  <p><strong>Environmental sustainability is, undeniably, a debt that business owes to society.</strong></p>
  <p>But it can also be a path to increased profitability and competitiveness. Think of it as first-mover advantage: companies that act bigger and faster on sustainability are performing better. Meanwhile, time is running out on a fast-follower strategy.</p>
  <p>Our survey respondents illuminate the way forward for companies looking to scale their sustainability efforts – and their performance. Learn more by <a href="/research/environmental-sustainability-affects-competitiveness">reading our findings</a>.</p>

        <p>How Environmental Sustainability Affects Competitiveness</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Call it balance sheet blindness: Companies tallying up their profits and losses tend not to calculate what damage to the Earth is costing them or society.</strong></p>
  <p>In many cases, they assume they don’t need to worry about it until some point in the future.</p>
  <p>But in a recent SAP Insights global survey of business professionals who are knowledgeable about their organization’s sustainability goals, actions, and reporting methods, respondents tell us that most of their companies are taking at least some steps toward greater environmental sustainability – and that the more effort companies put toward that goal, the more successful they expect their performance to be. In fact, we found a significant minority of respondents who say that environmental sustainability is already financially material<sup>*</sup> to their businesses and another group that believes it will become imminent in the near future.</p>
  <p>The Material Now group, or the <em>Nows</em>, make up 17% of our survey respondents. Leaders at these companies not only see clearly that the fortunes of their businesses are inevitably linked to those of the planet; they’re finding ways to make that link pay off. They are transforming their companies <em>and</em> achieving better business results than the companies represented by the remaining 83% of our respondents.</p>
  <p>Even among this 83%, however, we found some respondents who have taken off their blinders: 22% think sustainability will be material to their businesses within five years. This group, which we call the <em>Imminents</em>, says their companies are more likely to be taking action on sustainability – and to see business performance gains – than the remaining 61% of respondents, whom we refer to as the <em>Laters</em>. (See Figure 1.)</p>
  <p>Our survey data does not <em>prove</em> cause and effect between materiality and business success. However, across all respondents, there is a strong correlation between the two. And this strong correlation suggests that when business leaders look at value creation through the lens of sustainability, they find opportunities to grow and improve performance.</p>

  <h3 id="the-nows-imminents-and-laters-each-act-differently-when-it-comes-to-environmental-sustainability">The Nows, Imminents, and Laters each act differently when it comes to environmental sustainability.</h3>
  <p>The sooner that respondents believe sustainability will be material to their companies’ operations, the more likely they expect their companies to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>See higher revenue for the current fiscal year</li>
    <li>Consider sustainability a high investment priority</li>
    <li>Collect data about sustainability for a longer period</li>
    <li>Use sustainability data to inform more decisions</li>
    <li>Be more satisfied with the quality of sustainability data</li>
    <li>Distribute responsibility for action on sustainability more broadly within the organization</li>
    <li>Have a greater understanding of the positive correlations between sustainability and profitability as well as sustainability and competitiveness</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Nows – the 17% of respondents who believe environmental issues are already materially affecting their companies’ finances and operations – stand out because they are significantly ahead of even the Imminents in each of the areas listed above. They also have more committed leadership. Our survey shows that the Nows’ plans to incorporate sustainability into business operations are driven from the top. The Now leaders see the need for change and drive it forward, while other respondents are doing less and moving more slowly.</p>

  <p>The Now respondents say their companies also have more data than the Imminents and the Laters about the environmental effects of their businesses, and they use it better. They see fewer barriers to action. They invest more, both in money and in people, to support sustainability. And, crucially, they consider sustainability an essential part of their business strategy.</p>
  <p>In addition, the Nows are more optimistic about their companies’ strategy: They are 11% more likely than the Imminents and Laters to expect that environmental sustainability will increase long-term revenues and profits.</p>
  <p>That’s not to say what the Now companies are doing is easy. Our survey found that pursuing sustainability involves a complex system of business drivers so intertwined that difficult trade-offs could result. But even this could work to the Nows’ advantage, allowing them to widen the competitive gap between themselves and companies that are postponing those decisions.</p>
  <p>The complexity of acting on sustainability is lost on no one. But the correlation that we see between action and business success should be both a signal and a call to action for companies that are unsure about or resistant to making sustainability part of their business strategy and operations. Financial materiality for sustainability is already here: The question is no longer when to act, but how.</p>
  <h3 id="motivations-to-act">Motivations to act</h3>
  <p>Some major companies have already made <a href="/resources/sustainability-strategy-profits-follow-purpose">sustainability</a> not just a pledge but a strategy. U.S. automaker General Motors has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/business/general-motors-electric-cars.html">committed</a> to manufacturing only electric cars, vans, and SUVs by 2035. Meanwhile, German automaker Volkswagen has already made big changes to try to win market share early in the shift to electric. It will transform the bulk of its fleet – more than 30 models – to electric power within the next four years.</p>
  <p>Such strategic bets aren’t limited to the auto industry. In 2020, investment giant BlackRock made sustainability its new standard for investing its US$2.7 trillion portfolio.</p>
  <p>The big marquee names are no accident. Our survey found that the Now respondents are more likely to be from large (revenues of $750 million or more) companies. Some reasons may be that the Nows are aware that their companies have extensive effects on the environment and that larger companies have greater economies of scale and the discretionary budget to measure and mitigate those effects.</p>

  <h2 id="a-different-mindset">A different mindset</h2>
  <p>Across the board, the Now respondents think about sustainability differently from Imminents and Laters. The most notable differences lie in their companies’ motivations for pursuing sustainability, their methods for doing so, and what they expect the results to be. Notably, their approach seems to hinge on the actions (or lack thereof) of company leaders.</p>
  <p>To illustrate: We asked respondents to choose up to five factors (from a list of 12) that motivate their companies to take environmental action. From that short list, we asked them to rank each factor in order of importance.</p>
  <p>Among the Nows, the most frequently chosen number one motivator for their companies to take environmental action is CEO and board commitment, followed by government regulations, the company’s stated purpose, commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and revenue and profit growth opportunities. These are primarily philosophical, future-oriented drivers that suggest the Now respondents’ companies are being proactive about environmental consequences and consciously connecting them to business outcomes.</p>
  <p>Both the Imminents and the Laters say their companies are more influenced by traditional business priorities than the Now organizations. For example, the Laters are more likely than the Nows to be motivated by factors such as revenue and profit growth opportunities, whereas the Imminents are more likely than the Nows to be motivated by customer demand and opportunities to develop new offerings. (See Figure 2.)</p>
  <p>While the Nows say their companies have decided there are strategic benefits to moving quickly, the data doesn’t tell us why – or why the Imminents and Laters are slower to act. It may be that the latter two groups think that their companies are deliberately taking a “fast follower” approach, letting others shoulder the risk of experimenting with new solutions.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Imminents and Laters, the Nows say their leaders have assigned accountability for actions that improve the environment to 21% more roles across the organization.</p>
  <p>Forty-eight percent of the Nows and Imminents say their companies are aware of environmental actions taken by their business partners and suppliers, compared to just 39% of the Laters. This is presumably because the Nows and Imminents want their companies’ own commitments to that goal to be reflected throughout their supply chains.</p>
  <p>A company’s investments are the clearest indicator of its strategies and goals. The Nows are more likely than the Imminents and Laters to say that their companies are directing investments toward improving the environment, and Nows are more likely to be planning to increase those investments.</p>
  <p>Taken together, the most frequently cited top priority investment for all respondents we surveyed is mitigating climate change, cited by 17%.</p>
  <p>Interestingly, the next three highest priorities – use of recycled, reclaimed, or renewable materials; reducing solid and hazardous waste through recycling and reuse; and improving resource availability through products designed for reuse, repair, and remanufacture – are key components of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability/what-is-circular-economy.html">circular economy</a>. That together they are a priority for 40% of respondents suggests a high interest in circular business methods.</p>
  <p>However, the Nows say their companies consider every one of these circular-model investments a higher priority than the Imminents and the Laters do. The gap between the percentages of each group prioritizing each category suggests their companies’ relative commitment. (See Figure 3.)</p>
  <p>In addition, 44% of the Nows say their companies intend to increase spending on sustainability investments over the next three years. The Imminents are close at 41%, but the Laters are far behind, with just 30% saying their companies plan to increase their spending.</p>
  <p>Indeed, 19% of the Laters say their companies intend to <em>decrease</em> their investment in sustainability or have no plans to invest in it, compared to 13% of the Imminents and just 9% of the Nows.</p>

  <h2 id="data-drives-sustainability-decisions">Data drives sustainability decisions</h2>
  <h3 id="we-think-that-the-now-companies-are-more-likely-to-prioritize-environmental-sustainability-because-their-leaders-are-better-systems-thinkers">We think that the Now companies are more likely to prioritize environmental sustainability because their leaders are better systems thinkers.</h3>
  <p>They understand that individual issues such as climate change are not independent but are part of dynamic, complex systems that constantly interact with each other. Systems thinkers know that outcomes are determined by the interconnected elements of the larger system that their companies are part of, and they prioritize long-term value creation over short-term problem solving.</p>
  <p>For the Now respondents’ companies, the environment is another important piece of an interconnected system. This can be seen in the fact that they’ve been collecting more data about their business and its environmental impact for a longer period of time. This data gives them the visibility to anticipate better business outcomes, which implies that they recognize the value of sustainability data in driving strategic and operational decisions.</p>
  <p>Companies with more data tend to have a more holistic view of their business, which gives them more granular insights into the trade-offs they can make to deliver better overall outcomes. Data about sustainability is part of this broader picture; the Now companies’ wide array of data helps them see the well-being of the planet as not only intertwined with but inherent to the well-being of their businesses.</p>
  <p>The consumer products industry offers an example of how a data-supported approach to sustainability might play out. Many consumer products are packaged the same way, whether they’re sold in Stockholm or Shanghai. However, as governments begin to regulate single-use packaging for environmental reasons, a packaging design may generate different costs and benefits depending on where it’s used.</p>
  <p>With good data, a company can explore the financial effects of creating unique packaging for individual markets to attract more customers, pursue zero waste aspirations, or lower the costs of following local environmental regulations. The company would even be able to predict the most cost-efficient timeframe for developing new packaging rather than letting regulations force the issue.</p>
  <p>However, even the most comprehensive data sets aren’t perfect. Among all respondents, 79% report being dissatisfied with the quality of the data they collect about environmental sustainability. The pain isn’t evenly distributed; the Nows report the least dissatisfaction, followed by the Imminents and the Laters. (See Figure 4.)</p>

  </p>
  <p><em>Figure 4: Who's not happy with data now?</em></p>
  <p>Although all groups share common complaints about data quality, the Now respondents’ companies are less likely to experience them. The Nows are also less likely than the Imminents or the Laters to lack confidence that the data is complete and covers the required scope, to want data to be collected more frequently, to need faster access, and to want more transparency in the calculations or assumptions used to make estimates. Though these barriers are all about data, they are as rooted in business processes as they are in technology. (See Figure 5.)</p>
  <p>There are many possible reasons why the Nows say they are more satisfied with data quality around environmental sustainability. One may be that they say they have more data: 44% say they’ve been collecting relevant data for more than five years, compared to 34% of the Laters and just 20% of the Imminents. This gives the Nows a larger and deeper database from which to derive insights they trust and can act on to achieve more useful and predictable results.</p>
  <p>However, given the extent of dissatisfaction with data quality, it’s not surprising that <em>all</em> respondents say that the most significant barriers to acting on environmental issues are data-dependent uncertainties.</p>

  <p>They all say that it’s not clear how their companies should embed sustainability into processes and systems. Nor is there clarity about how to align their efforts with business strategy or confirm ROI.</p>
  <p>However, the Nows say their companies see fewer barriers to action. In fact, the Nows are far more likely than either the Imminents or the Laters to say that they have no specific barriers.</p>
  <p>The Imminent and Later respondents say that their companies are hampered by an absence of leadership at the top. For example, they’re significantly more likely than the Nows to say that environmental sustainability lacks support from senior management, that it’s not a business priority, that there’s organizational resistance to acting, or that they don’t know where to start. (See Figure 6.)</p>
  <p>We didn’t uncover a definitive reason why the Nows find it easier to overcome the obstacles to acting sustainably. It’s possible that because the Nows have more enthusiastic leadership, more widespread accountability, and higher motivation to act, they’re less daunted by any individual barriers.</p>

  <h3 id="in-examining-what-differentiates-the-nows-from-the-rest-three-things-stand-out">In examining what differentiates the Nows from the rest, three things stand out:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data matters.</strong> The Nows are more likely than the Imminents or Laters to apply their environmental sustainability data to a strong degree to their operational and strategic decisions. (See Figure 7.)</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability is not a drag</strong>. The Nows are also much more likely to believe that taking action to improve the environment will increase their competitiveness as well as increase long-term profit. (See Figure 8.)</li>
    <li><strong>Leaders are leading</strong>. Financial statements alone are not telling the Nows to act – their leaders are. The leadership of the Now companies understand that a healthy environment contributes to the performance of the business and have decided to embrace sustainability for benefit.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>
  <p><em>Figure 7: Does sustainability guide your strategy?</em></p>
  <p>Of course, believing in something isn’t enough to make it true. When respondents believe environmental factors already affect their company’s performance, or will do so sooner rather than later, they are more likely to use environmental data to inform decision-making. This suggests that the Nows are taking a broader, more long-term view that has led them to address sustainability, even though they may not see immediate results.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the Laters face a classic dilemma: If they have perfectly good revenue streams from doing things that don’t account for the environment, they probably see barriers to change as being too high. For example, shifting from single-use to reusable containers will require massive infrastructure changes for manufacturers and retailers. The handful of innovators in this area have yet to deliver solutions at the necessary scale.</p>
  <p>But in light of inescapable and increasingly urgent research demonstrating the damage wrought by environmental issues such as climate change and resource scarcity, we were frankly surprised that the Laters constitute such a large majority: 61% of respondents. They are saying they don’t believe environmental sustainability will be material to their financial results for five years or more.</p>

  </p>
  <p><em>Figure 8: Sustainability sustains competitiveness and profits</em></p>
  <p>The data clearly shows that all respondents see sustainability as a major strategic and operational challenge. It may be that the Laters have decided to wait until meaningful carbon taxes, supply chain regulations, and other legal requirements affect their bottom line, which could be years into the future.</p>
  <p>But after years in which public interest, political will, and business response weren’t unified, we’ve reached a moment when they are. Companies that once only aspired to make incremental annual cuts to their carbon emissions are now committing to science-based targets and cutting emissions by half, in less than a decade. Many are going much further by putting sustainability at the core of their business strategy. It’s a big leap, one that requires believing that sustainability is crucial to future competitiveness.</p>
  <p>Though the balance sheet may not always say it yet, sustainability is already material to companies. And viewing it that way won’t just help save the planet, it will also improve business performance – sooner than many business leaders think.</p>

      <div>How much should you care about an especially demanding minority of your market?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If they’re in the group we’ve dubbed the Passionates, you should care a lot. Because if you don’t show that your values align with theirs, they won’t buy from you, work for you, or even respect you.</p>
  <p>Passionates care about multiple important global issues, and they care about all of them with equal intensity. Everything matters to them: themselves, other people, society as a whole, the planet. And while they currently make up only 20% of the general population, they’re likely to become more dominant over time. That makes them an increasingly influential market force to reckon with.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-a-passionate">What is a Passionate?</h2>
  <p>We asked 10,000 adult residents of the United States and Canada to tell us how strongly they care about 17 critical global issues ranging from healthcare access, climate change, and income inequality to data privacy, sexual harassment, and the influence of social media on society.</p>

  <p>Respondents first chose the five issues they care about most. Then, on a scale of 1 to 4, we asked them to rate how intensely they experienced 12 specific emotions (with 4 representing the strongest concern) when thinking about these issues. We presented six positive emotions (admiration, enthusiasm, inspiration, optimism, pride, and relief) and six negative emotions (alienation, anger, disgust, fear, frustration, and sadness).</p>

  <p><em>Figure 1: Intensity of emotional response to top 5 global issues</em></p>
  <p>Given the importance of the issues, we were not surprised to find that all respondents care about each one to some extent. The five issues respondents cited most often included healthcare access, climate change, mental health, poverty and hunger, and education. However, the results also revealed one group of people who seem incapable of being nonchalant about any of the issues. Indeed, this distinct group cares 37% more strongly, on average, about every single issue we asked about.</p>
  <p>For example, the Passionates care 35% more strongly than all respondents about healthcare access, 33% more strongly about climate change, and 39% more strongly about mental health (Figure 1).</p>
  <p>Like everyone, this group cares more about some issues than others. However, nothing is unimportant to them; they care deeply even about the issues they consider a lower priority, and they do so with greater intensity and commitment than other people do.</p>
  <p>Therefore, it makes sense to name this distinct group the Passionates.</p>

  <h2 id="what-characterizes-passionates">What characterizes Passionates?</h2>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Passionates made up one in five, or 20%, of our survey respondents.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Like the general population, half the Passionates are male, and half are female. They are slightly more likely to live in the United States than in Canada, but they are otherwise not concentrated in any particular geographic region. Their household income distribution also mirrors that of the general population, which suggests that income is no more significant than any other factor in making someone feel strongly about global issues.</p>
  <p>We also found Passionates among every generation, although the younger someone is, the more likely they are to be a Passionate (see Figure 2).</p>

  <p><em>Figure 2: Percentage of Passionates among different generations</em></p>
  <p>To understand why this matters, consider that for many of the issues we covered in the survey, the more strongly respondents feel, the more closely they align with traditionally liberal political views. Despite popular wisdom that people inevitably become more conservative with age, research consistently shows that individuals’ political attitudes remain “remarkably stable” throughout their lives, according to a study in <strong>The Journal of Politics.</strong> We expect, then, that as the remaining <a href="/resources/generation-z-behavior-explained">Gen Zers</a> enter adulthood (the youngest are halfway through grammar school), the influence of Passionates on the market will grow accordingly – and it will not wane as each generation ages.</p>
  <p>We found Passionates among every generation, although the younger someone is, the more likely they are to be a Passionate.</p>
  <p>Passionates care significantly more than other people about certain issues. They feel:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>19% more strongly about business leaders promoting a positive environment on social media</strong></li>
    <li><strong>18% more strongly about sustainable sourcing</strong></li>
    <li><strong>16% more strongly about poverty and hunger</strong></li>
    <li><strong>13% more strongly about data privacy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>12% more strongly about access to quality education</strong></li>
    <li><strong>9% more strongly about the importance of workplace diversity</strong></li>
    <li><strong>9% more strongly about access to healthcare</strong></li>
    <li><strong>9% more strongly about the importance of individual rights</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>They are also 7% more likely to say that the drawbacks of social media outweigh its benefits.</p>
  <p>Another way in which Passionates stand out is their sunny outlook: they’re 7% more optimistic than the general public. Further research is needed to determine the impact of COVID-19, but at the time of the survey (January 2020, before the pandemic spread to North America), 74% of Passionates said they felt positive about the future, compared to 67% of other respondents.</p>
  <p>This finding seems counterintuitive; one might assume at first that being acutely concerned about the importance and urgency of every global issue would make people feel anxious or even desperate about the need to change things. However, it’s possible that feeling strongly about an issue gives Passionates a greater belief that they’re capable of shaping the world as they envision it.</p>
  <p>What we do know with certainty is that Passionates believe in taking action to make the world a better place – and they expect business leaders to do the same.</p>

  <h2 id="what-do-passionates-want-from-business-leaders">What do Passionates want from business leaders?</h2>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>They expect you to act, and if they don't approve of your efforts, their judgment is swift and unsparing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Passionates share the general population’s belief that governments should take the greatest responsibility for solving global problems, but that communities, individuals, and businesses also play a role. Where they differ is that unlike most people, Passionates won’t let your company off the hook.</p>
  <p>They want business leaders to care about the issues they care about, and to go beyond just releasing a strongly worded statement. They expect you to act, and if they don’t approve of your efforts, their judgment is swift and unsparing.</p>
  <p>It’s so important to Passionates that a company is making a difference in the world that they’re significantly more likely to use that as a criterion when deciding whether to buy from, work for, or even respect a company:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>90% consider it in a buying decision (vs. 77% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>92% consider it in an employment decision (vs. 82% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>93% consider it when choosing whether to respect a company (vs. 84% of everyone else)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not believe this is a coincidence. If anything, it suggests that Passionates are looking to act on their beliefs.</p>
  <h2 id="what-makes-passionates-want-to-buy-from-you">What makes Passionates want to buy from you?</h2>
  <p>Passionates consider the same traditional factors when making a purchase that everyone else does; they just don’t consider them quite as important.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>84% say price is important (vs. 88% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>84% say quality is important (vs. 89% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>83% say product/service details are important (vs. 86% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>83% say a positive buying experience is important (vs. 84% of everyone else)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>What really stands out to Passionates, compared to everyone else, are the intrinsic characteristics of your company’s leaders. For example, they care more than other respondents that your leaders are authentic (75% to 62%), empathetic (71% to 53%), and that leaders’ public positions on issues align with their own (64% to 51%).</p>
  <p>Passionates are also far more sensitive than the general population to aspects of how you run your business and think about your products, such as organizational transparency (75% to 62%) and whether your product is aesthetically pleasing (73% to 62%) (Figure 3).</p>

  <p>What really stands out to Passionates, compared to everyone else, are the intrinsic characteristics of your company’s leaders.</p>
  <h2 id="what-makes-passionates-want-to-work-for-you">What makes Passionates want to work for you?</h2>
  <p>Like everyone, Passionates care about pay; 82% say salary is an important consideration in choosing an employer. But it matters less to them than it does to the general public (85%). So does a positive work experience (85% to 87%).</p>
  <p>When deciding who to work for, Passionates are more likely than others to watch for indications that an organization is ethical and committed to more than just making a profit.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>82% care about leaders’ authenticity (vs. 79% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>82% value organizational transparency (vs. 78% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>82% factor in leaders’ openness to new ideas (vs. 78% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>81% consider leaders’ ability to effect change (vs. 77% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>81% look for leaders’ empathy (vs. 72% of everyone else)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It’s telling that Passionates believe these factors are as important as or only slightly less important than salary.</p>
  <p>Interestingly, the survey also suggests that Passionates consider how their choice of employer might reflect on them: 71% of Passionates say they consider online reviews showing what other people think of the company when deciding where to work, compared to just 52% of other people (Figure 4).</p>

  <h2 id="what-makes-passionates-respect-your-company">What makes Passionates respect your company?</h2>
  <p>Passionates respect a company for the same utilitarian reasons other people do, but as with the factors that influence their buying decisions, these matter to them less than how a company and its leaders behave compared to the general population:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>85% cite the quality of the company’s products and services (vs. 88% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>84% cite the features and performance of those products and services (vs. 87% of everyone else)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>84% cite price (vs. 86% of everyone else)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Leaders’ ethical behavior, authenticity, passion and trustworthiness, and organizational transparency matter more or less equally to everyone in determining whether a company is worthy of respect. However, Passionates diverge from other respondents in notable ways when it comes to the following factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Leaders’ openness to new ideas (83% to 78%)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Leaders’ ability to effect change (82% to 79%)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Corporate actions in the community (82% to 78%)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Leaders’ empathy (82% to 74%)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, when deciding whether to respect a company, 78% of Passionates think it is important to feel as if they belong to a community connected to it. A similar percentage consider the company’s partner ecosystem and the aesthetics of the company’s products or services in their decisions. These factors were important to only two-thirds of other respondents (Figure 5).</p>

  <h2 id="why-should-i-care-about-the-passionates">Why should I care about the Passionates?</h2>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Passionates may only account for one in five of your current and prospective employees and customers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Not only is this a significant minority now, but their proportion of the population is likely to continue to grow.</p>
  <p>Millennials, who were born between 1980 and 1994, are assuming leadership roles, and they are making or authorizing significant purchasing decisions. Gen Z is right behind them; the oldest members of that generational cohort (born in the mid-1990s) are finishing college, stepping onto career paths, and launching their adult lives, while slightly younger Gen Zers are in secondary and post-secondary school, taking their first jobs, and starting to flex their spending power.</p>
  <p>Because we only surveyed adults, we can’t predict whether the youngest Gen Zers (who, again, are in grammar school) or the generation that follows them (just beginning school) will be even more passionate than preceding generations. But if we extrapolate from current trends, we think it’s clear that Passionates will influence the market for years to come.</p>
  <p>As Passionates become increasingly prevalent in the population and insistent on realizing their passions, you can’t afford to ignore them. In fact, your company needs to clear a much higher bar just to induce them to consider working for, buying from, or interacting with you at all. And to do that, you need above all to cultivate the intrinsic characteristics of your company that they consider essential:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Determine how Passionates feel about a key issue, align your organization’s position with theirs, and take some clear and irrefutable action to show it, such as redesigning a product to be more environmentally friendly or seeking out and showcasing clients who support their values.</li>
    <li>Demonstrate the authenticity, empathy, and transparency they seek as you pursue goals like recruiting new employees and introducing new marketing campaigns.</li>
    <li>Create a way for them to connect by engaging with you, such as launching a forum where consumers can interact with other customers or by encouraging employees to volunteer with their co-workers in the local community.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We expect Passionates to become an increasingly large and influential part of your workforce and customer base. Showing them that you share their passions is essential to your future success – and now is the time to consider how you intend to do that.</p>
  <p>Passionates will influence the market for years to come.</p>

  <p>Running a business well is no longer enough for a leader to be successful.</p>
  <p>Price, product quality, and a positive experience for customers and employees – the traditional factors that influence whether people buy from, work for, and respect a company – have become merely the price of admission.</p>
  <p>A groundswell of voices, including customers, employees, and entire communities, are demanding that business leaders take responsibility for society’s well-being, not just the bottom line.</p>
  <p>This powerful, growing coalition wants leaders who stand up for them by working on important global issues and mobilizing others to action, even in areas that are not always related to their business, such as health, climate, and equality. They are staking their money and careers on such leaders, who embrace the idea that playing an active role in society’s well-being is not just nice to do but central to business success.</p>
  <p>The desire for leaders to use their power and influence to improve society is clear from our survey of 10,000 North American consumers: 61% told us a leader’s position on an issue affects their buying behavior, 73% said it affects their employment decisions, and 77% said it affects their decisions about which companies they respect.</p>

  <p>Within this coalition is a subset of people that you can’t afford to ignore. They are the vanguard of a deep shift in how individuals interact with and think about businesses. We call them the Passionates. This group, accounting for one-fifth of everyone surveyed, reported the most intense feelings about a range of global issues. Your most important stakeholders want you to look beyond the bottom line and start changing the world for them – and with them.</p>
  <p>Passionates won’t buy from you, work for you, or even respect you unless you take a strong position – and action – on issues that go far beyond managing the business. Indeed, 73% of Passionates say a leader’s position on societal issues affects their buying behavior, compared to 57% for all others. Eighty-one percent count it as part of their decision about whom to work for versus 71% for all others. And while 75% of all respondents say a strong position on global issues affects their respect for a company, Passionates take this to another level: 82% include it as motivating factor.</p>
  <p>Most importantly, Passionates represent your most highly prized customers and employees today and in the future. Although we found Passionates in every generation, more than half are Millennials, the largest generation on the planet, whose influence as consumers and employees is becoming impossible to ignore (see the next section Who are the Passionates?).</p>

  <h2 id="who-are-the-passionates">Who are the Passionates?</h2>
  <p>Surveys ask what people think. We also asked what they feel. That revealed an important group of individuals that feels intensely about a range of issues, including universal healthcare access, climate change, poverty, and mental health.</p>
  <p>This group, the Passionates, make up 20% of our respondent base. Passionates run across all generations but are a predominately young group. The generation with the highest percentage of Passionates is Gen Z, with 31% of their respondents being Passionates, followed closely by Millennials at 28%. A much smaller percentage of Gen Xers and Baby Boomers are Passionates: 18% and 14%, respectively. Passionate Millennials are the most important of these groups, because they are becoming your preeminent customers and leaders. Gen Zers, who are also passionate, have begun to graduate college. “The students of today will be working for you tomorrow. Millennials are now old enough to have leadership roles in your organization,” says Dr. David Caruso, a management psychologist and research affiliate with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.</p>
  <p>"Gen Z and Millennials are feelings-oriented generations and they want you to attend to the feelings of others,” he adds. “To simply dismiss them as narcissistic or self-focused is a big mistake. They’re passionate not just about themselves but also about others and the planet.</p>
  <p>When making a purchase, Passionates put more importance than all other respondents on leaders’ intrinsic characteristics, such as authenticity, empathy, and alignment with their positions on issues. Similarly, when deciding who to work for, Passionates prioritize ethical behavior, trust, transparency, and authenticity. Other survey respondents care more about traditional factors, such as how much they will get paid and whether the products they buy have the right product features, performance, and aesthetics.</p>
  <p>Passionates care less about their own compensation than everyone else. Indeed, they will take a pay cut for a job that makes an impact on the world. More than three-fourths (78%) would like the CEO to take a pay cut, too. The continuing global and potentially catastrophic pandemic only amplifies this new truth that has been emerging over the last decade: leaders looking to make an impression on customers and employees would do well to make an impression on the world. “This shift has been coming for a long time and the current pandemic has only accelerated the need for it,” says Louise Roper, CEO of leadership consultancy Volans.</p>
  <p>“There is a pull and push happening at same time,” says Rajeev Peshawaria, CEO of Stewardship Asia Centre, a business leadership and strategy consultant, and the author of Open Source Leadership. “The pull is that everyone is naked and exposed so you’d better do the right thing, otherwise you will be found out. The push is that your customers and employees want you to do the right thing. They want leaders who take a stand. And the power has shifted to them.”</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Passionates want leaders who look out for their fellow humans.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It’s no longer enough to focus on shareholder returns while marginalizing or ignoring global issues, such as healthcare access, climate change, poverty, and mental health (the top concerns of all our survey respondents) that business leaders may deem out of scope and out of their control. Leaders who don’t find ways to address broad economic, social, and environmental concerns while growing profitable businesses will find themselves sidelined.</p>
  <p>The good news: These goals are not mutually exclusive. By shifting how they think about the purpose of their business and who it should help, leaders can identify actions that will boost the bottom line while bettering the world.</p>
  <p>Making this transition can be difficult, because it is risky. Stakeholders within and outside of the company who disagree with any stand a leader takes may push back – hard. Leaders who were taught to guide their companies from quarter to quarter, measuring their success in terms of short-term revenues and share prices, will need to learn how to take a longer, broader view and be willing to advocate against skeptics for their vision.</p>
  <p>The stakes could not be higher. Unprecedented, parallel threats, including rolling pandemics, intensifying natural disasters, and political unrest, require bold leaders who have an expanded view of their role, understand the deep interconnections in the global economy, and can work in more collaborative ways than ever before.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>But true leadership is not about what you can get from the world. It’s about what you can give to it. Real leadership comes from a burning desire to make things better.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There’s no time for delay. Sixty-two percent of Passionates believe that business leaders should always take positions and speak out about global issues, regardless of the relevance it has to their business, as do 43% of the other respondents. That means a large majority of your customers, employees, and the public are watching.</p>
  <p>“We used to think about leadership as an act of taking rather than giving. You rise up the corporate ladder to take over as CEO,” says Peshawaria. “But true leadership is not about what you can get from the world. It’s about what you can give to it. Real leadership comes from a burning desire to make things better.”</p>

    <div>
      <div>Even before 2020, leaders sensed the need to make big changes in how they ran their companies.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In August 2019, the CEOs of nearly 200 multinational corporations signed a statement publicly pledging to lead their companies not simply for the benefit of their shareholders but for the good of their customers, their employees, their growing supplier ecosystems, and their communities.</p>
  <p>The pledge gained a fair amount of attention. But our survey respondents expect more.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>They know in their bones what the COVID-19 pandemic made painfully clear: everything is connected, and everyone is suffering.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>While respondents believe that governments have the primary responsibility for addressing the world’s problems, they think businesses should be equal partners with individuals and communities in doing their part. (See the next section, The 5 new truths about leadership.)</p>
  <h2 id="the-5-new-truths-about-leadership">The 5 new truths about leadership</h2>
  <p>All survey respondents agree on one thing: The assumptions that many leaders made before this current era of globally connected issues, such as healthcare, climate, and equality, are no longer valid.</p>
  <div class="table">
    <div>
      <div>Old assumptions</div>
      <div>New truths</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Taking action or public positions on issues that do not directly affect the business is a waste of corporate leaders’ time and effort and can even detract from performance.</div>
      <div>90% of respondents want leaders to speak out and act on global issues. And that action will pay dividends. 79% of respondents say it influences their buying decisions, 84% their employment decisions, and 86% their decision on which companies to respect.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Consumers only care about buying a good product, at the right price, and having a good experience in the process.</div>
      <div>Consumers still care about traditional buying criteria, but these won’t differentiate you from competitors anymore. They now see other values as intrinsic to their buying decisions. 85% consider factors such as a leaders’ empathy, trustworthiness, and authenticity; their ability to affect change; their openness to new ideas; whether leaders are ethical; and whether they run a transparent organization before making a purchase.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Leaders don’t need to explain the reasons for their decisions, even to employees.</div>
      <div>When leaders are open about their reasoning, employees are more likely to want to work for them. 89% of respondents said that leaders’ transparency, trust, and authenticity affected their employment decisions.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Returns to shareholders justify paying CEOs extravagantly.</div>
      <div>Many people feel that pay inequity is out of control. 72% of respondents support limiting CEO salaries to a fixed percentage of employees’ average pay. Leaders are accountable for creating a work environment that recognizes employees have lives beyond their jobs: 68% of respondents say the demands of the workplace are preventing them from having a balanced life.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Work–life balance is an individual’s responsibility. Employees must figure out how to manage their lives.</div>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>To make this shift in how they think about their businesses, leaders must begin to work on a different plane, expanding their perspective to include the larger ecosystem in which their organization runs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For the last 50 years, business leaders have been persuaded that their companies exist in isolation – the most prominent influence on that attitude being Nobel Prize–winning economist Milton Friedman and his 1970 article asserting the primacy of serving shareholders. Over time, leaders have returned to the idea that their companies have some duty to society, in the form of corporate social responsibility initiatives. But these efforts, Peshawaria observes, have always been treated as offshoots rather than central to the business model.</p>
  <p>Our survey respondents care most about issues like healthcare access, climate change, and mental health, which cannot be addressed or resolved in a silo. Passionates’ feelings about these issues run even deeper than those of other respondents.</p>
  <p>Leaders need to think, and act, more broadly. To focus not just on what traditional stakeholders think and want but to consider people once thought to be beyond a company’s reach and responsibility.</p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>Embracing empathy for all matters more now than ever, says Caruso. “Some leaders will say that’s not my job. It takes too much time. And I get that,” he says. “But they need to take their head out of the sand because to succeed today they need to lead in a very different way and need to develop a new set of skills.”</p>
  <p>Given that keeping a business profitable is already more than a full-time job, attending to society’s big and complex problems on top of it may feel overwhelming. But when community well-being and global issues become intrinsic to the job, it won’t be another ball to juggle. It will be central to the mission.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Our research suggests several actions leaders can take to appeal to stakeholders who expect more from a company than a well-priced, good-quality product or service and a positive customer experience.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3 id="embrace-transparency">Embrace transparency.</h3>
  <p>It’s not a question of if, but when, your customers, suppliers, and the world at large find out what your company is doing behind the scenes. More than 60% of Passionates say trust and transparency matter when making a purchase, more than 75% consider it when making an employment decision, and more than 80% cite it as influencing whether they respect a firm. “In the past, business leaders who wanted to succeed maximized control and were opaque in their dealings,” says Peshawaria. “But today, they need to minimize control and maximize transparency. That’s the new mandate, and those leaders who are slow to understand this will not survive.” Patagonia, for example, details how its products are made, where it gets its materials, and the working conditions of those involved in production.</p>
  <h3 id="give-employees-a-role-in-developing-the-qualities-of-the-organization">Give employees a role in developing the qualities of the organization.</h3>
  <p>Seventy-nine percent of survey respondents say that a leaders’ openness to new ideas increases their workplace engagement. Leaders can create processes for collecting and acting on employees’ input about the organization’s vision and values. Involving employees in the process will increase their participation in the pursuit of these broader goals.</p>
  <p>The Passionates are tired of proclamations. They want to see companies make tangible changes.</p>

  </p>
  <h3 id="create-a-shared-purpose">Create a shared purpose.</h3>
  <p>A shared purpose isn’t simply an articulated mandate from the leader. It is a vision co-created with stakeholders considering for themselves what the purpose should be, according to Mark Bonchek, CEO of Shift Thinking, a consultancy. The vision should be a natural expression of what the organization stands for and connect how it makes money with how it contributes to the world. South African medical insurer Discovery, for example, used a shared-value approach to develop and then articulate a broad vision: increase people’s life expectancy by changing their behavior. Once an organization has defined its purpose leaders can share what it means to their stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, political leaders, others) and enable them to contribute, says Bonchek.</p>
  <h3 id="demonstrate-that-you-can-influence-the-world-not-just-change-your-organization">Demonstrate that you can influence the world, not just change your organization.</h3>
  <p>The Passionates are tired of proclamations. They want to see companies make tangible changes. More than 60% of the Passionates think that businesses need to play a role in improving educational systems, for example. Hewlett Packard Enterprise president and CEO Antonio Neri made education a focus in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. HP teamed up with the Global Business Coalition for Education to provide equipment to students whose schools were closed in Houston, Chicago, and Dallas.</p>
  <h3 id="address-workplace-fears-of-automation">Address workplace fears of automation.</h3>
  <p>Automation has been affecting workers for decades, but now we’re entering a new realm of concern: 75% of respondents have negative feelings about automation within the workplace. Respondents don’t just fear being replaced by technology; they also worry about it becoming their colleague.</p>
  <p>Indeed, 75% of respondents say they don’t want AI-enhanced robots telling them what to do. What’s more, we can no longer see automation as a niche problem, confined to a particular business function or a few roles: 60% of respondents now believe that the near-future holds mass unemployment due to emergence of AIs.</p>
  <p>Leaders will be expected to ensure that the people who use, or are affected by, new technologies understand how they will be hired, managed, and rewarded. “The fact is that we are experiencing a tectonic shift,” says Peshawaria. “Those that get it are upping their empathy and compassion quotient. There’s an opportunity to deal with this the right way and soften the fall.”</p>
  <h3 id="address-worklife-balance-for-employees">Address work–life balance for employees.</h3>
  <p>The idea that employees are hired to do a job and it’s up to them to figure out how to manage their lives is outdated. When people overwhelmingly say they have difficulty balancing their professional and personal lives (69% in our survey), it isn’t because they aren’t trying hard enough. Eventually, you’ll lose your burnt-out workers to someone who helps them with their struggle. This is an area where a new type of leader can really shine. Indra Nooyi, former CEO of PepsiCo, was passionate about addressing work–life balance; the company set up on-site childcare for employees at the headquarters and “near-site” for employees elsewhere. “This is a challenge we need to take on urgently,” she said at the time. “We need to come together, as corporations and as a society to support workers who are caring for young children, aging parents, or both.”</p>
  <p>It’s not a question of if, but when, your customers, suppliers, and the world at large find out what your company is doing behind the scenes.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Continuing on the same, old leadership path may seem easier but, ultimately, it’s untenable.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Taking this new road won’t be easy.</p>
  <p>“Leadership is about creating a better future, and naturally any attempt at doing so creates a whole lot of resistance,” Peshawaria says. “When you start living a set of values, you’re not going to make everyone happy. But the greatest leaders don’t give up.”</p>
  <p>The alternative is eventual destruction. “Those that don’t change will experience a decline because they lack this new set of hard skills necessary for the future – the skills needed to accurately tune in to the emotional climate and successfully manage emotions,” says Caruso. “Things will happen. Employees may leave. Customers may defect.” Whether that happens swiftly or slowly will depend on the situation. But it’s clear that it will happen.</p>
  <p>“There is an emotional storm coming your way,” says Caruso. “The students of today are looking for action on social justice and climate change, for example. There is going to be a wave of [activism] that you will no longer be able to ignore. All of this is a wonderful thing. This is a world where more people give a damn about others.”</p>

        <h1 id="capturing-circular-economy-value-in-waste-management">​Capturing Circular Economy Value in Waste Management</h1>
        <p>Rethinking the worth of everything – from underused and excess assets to waste products – can lead to sustainable innovations.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We (or at least many of us) sure do love our beer. Globally, <a href="https://www.kirinholdings.co.jp/english/news/2019/1224_01.html">189 billion liters</a> (roughly 50 billion gallons) of suds are swilled every year. The problem is that beer comes with a by-product: spent grains that are left over after the brewing process. Some are sold to farmers for animal feed, but most are trashed. That’s a lot of landfill.</p>
  <p>But brewers are now finding new ways to both avoid this waste and put it to good use while making some money. One example is Scottish independent brewery BrewDog, which is now using its spent grains to <a href="https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/08/24/BrewDog-s-global-craft-beer-business-goes-carbon-negative">generate</a> energy for its brewery. It has also made <a href="https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/08/24/BrewDog-s-global-craft-beer-business-goes-carbon-negative">dog treats</a> from the spent grain that would otherwise be thrown away and will soon release Bad Beer Vodka, a spirit made – as the name implies – from the company’s subpar beer.</p>
  <p>Given the current climate crisis, literally nothing should go to waste. Environmental concerns dictate that we must use the resources we have to their utmost capacity and with minimal leftovers.</p>
  <p>Rethinking how we use and conserve resources is not just an environmental issue; it’s also tied to financial stability and business continuity, as we have learned all too well from COVID-19.</p>
  <p>During this period of economic uncertainty, businesses need to wring the most value from everything they do. That means not just finding better, more efficient ways to do what they already do but also discovering untapped resources and capabilities that are hiding in plain sight, such as the spent grains in a brewery. Identifying these “new” resources and ways of doing things doesn’t have to be a random accident; it can be a highly disciplined and repeatable practice. Called “capacity capture,” it is an emerging way of doing business that will help companies manage these challenges, become more efficient, minimize waste, improve competitiveness, and find new revenue streams.</p>

  <p>Reframing waste as a potential asset is part of adapting to expectations across the board, says Andrew Winston of Winston Eco-Strategy. Waste is beginning to look just… wrong. “I think increasingly your investors, your communities, your employees are just less and less impressed with a company that doesn’t operate more efficiently and use its resources better,” Winston says.</p>
  <p><a href="/research/capacity-capture-a-new-approach-to-discovering-business-value">Capacity capture</a> – the utilization of assets and resources that were considered waste or weren’t used completely – is a key element of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability/what-is-circular-economy.html">circular economy</a>, a model in which one enterprise’s waste becomes another’s inputs for production. But even companies that recognize the necessity of this change have difficulty understanding how to implement capacity capture. That’s because capacity capture is a philosophy and a new approach to business. It takes creativity and a willingness to take risks and challenge assumptions. Businesses will need to reconsider fundamental assumptions about what they are and how they work.</p>
  <p>Capacity capture is about finding ways to reframe underused resources as assets with real value – whether it’s for your company or someone else’s.</p>
  <p>Apart from the fact that the environment is in real trouble – the planet is literally on fire, that birds are dropping from the sky, and we’re eating plastic with every meal – disposing of waste is getting too expensive. “I see a growing interest for a company to convert waste into resources,” says Rémy Le Moigne, managing director of Paris-based consultancy Gate C. “For a lot of companies, especially, for example, chemical companies, the cost to get rid of spent chemicals is sometimes very high, and they’re looking for solutions to reduce this cost, and one of the possible solutions is to convert waste into resources.”</p>

  <h2 id="capacity-capture-questions-assumptions">Capacity capture questions assumptions</h2>
  <p>The new trifecta of price, quality, and now values is driving consumers’ brand loyalty and purchasing decisions. Values have become less of an afterthought and more of a crucial ​​distinction.</p>
  <p>Winston believes there’s just been more awareness of waste in recent years. “Companies increasingly have to prove their value to society, their role in society, that they’re taking care of resources effectively,” he says.</p>
  <p>But the pandemic, along with other challenges facing companies today like the environment and increasing costs, has offered an opportunity to embark on a new way of thinking. Companies need to look for ideas that may not make sense in the context of how things have been done before. That includes ingrained assumptions about how the value of assets impact capacity.</p>
  <p>Capacity capture is about stretching organizational thinking by exploring untapped resources across three categories: Physical assets are the tangible objects and places that an organization holds. Digital assets include network infrastructure, data, and software. And human assets refer to people – their behaviors, roles, and skills.</p>
  <p>The capacity capture mindset looks at each of these assets with fresh eyes to find ways that value can be realized. This approach examines each untapped resource – no matter which category it falls in – to consider whether it is unwanted, excess, or underused.</p>
  <p>Prospective resources can be evaluated by considering how they could be reused by another part of an organization, either by themselves or combined with other resources; how a resource can be used as much as possible; and when and how selling, recycling, and donating make sense.</p>
  <p>Capacity capture looks at the value of assets in these categories and finds ways they can be exploited. For example, in some countries, fast food chain McDonald’s utilizes its used <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/business/neutral-fuels-dubai/index.html">cooking</a> oil as biofuel for delivery trucks, and one restaurant donated some as a replacement for liquid plastic for 3D printing.</p>

  <h2 id="three-types-of-untapped-resources-questions-for-exploration">Three types of untapped resources: Questions for exploration</h2>
  <p><strong>The capacity capture approach focuses on three asset categories – physical, digital, and human – and asks whether they are unwanted, excess, or underused.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Unwanted assets</strong> are created or accumulated as a by-product of another process. <strong>Excess assets</strong> are produced or gathered intentionally; they become surplus either because there are too many of them or because the process that created them is no longer in use. <strong>Underused assets</strong> are created intentionally; they’re in use but not to their full potential.</p>
  <p>The following examples look at different assets through the capacity capture lens:</p>
  <h3 id="physical-assets-tangible-objects-such-as-facilities-heavy-equipment-and-office-supplies">1. Physical assets (tangible objects, such as facilities, heavy equipment, and office supplies)</h3>
  <p><strong>Unwanted:</strong> What is created unintentionally as a side effect and then discarded?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> UK's Wensleydale Creamery works with a nearby bioenergy plant to convert whey waste into home heating energy.</p>
  <p><strong>Excess:</strong> What is produced intentionally but becomes surplus?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> Several European utility companies are working with Nissan and Mitsubishi to develop a means for electric car owners to sell energy stored in their vehicles’ batteries.</p>
  <p><strong>Underused:</strong> What kinds of existing assets are not used to their full potential?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> Coca-Cola transports vaccines using empty spaces in its refrigeration trucks.</p>
  <h3 id="digital-assets-network-infrastructure-software-data-and-metadata-and-bandwidth">2. Digital assets (network infrastructure, software, data and metadata, and bandwidth)</h3>
  <p><strong>Unwanted:</strong> What is collected incidentally and rarely used or analyzed?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> UnitedHealth Group spinoff Optum repurposes aggregated data and provides pharmaceutical companies an analysis of how their products are being used.</p>
  <p><strong>Excess:</strong> What is developed or gathered intentionally but rarely used?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> LED bulbs can be programmed to transmit data through visible light communication or Li-Fi networks.</p>
  <p><strong>Underused:</strong> What kinds of existing storage and channels are not used to their full potential?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> Amazon rented out excess computing infrastructure capacity, creating Amazon Web Services.</p>
  <h3 id="human-assets-people-and-their-behaviors-roles-and-skills">3. Human assets (people and their behaviors, roles, and skills)</h3>
  <p><strong>Unwanted</strong>: Where are people or their behaviors seen as undesirable?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> Mobile phones at business events were once considered rude. Now companies encourage employees to promote brands on their smartphone social media accounts.</p>
  <p><strong>Excess:</strong> Where do you gather people or encourage behaviors but then not use them fully?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> A company that <a href="/resources/how-to-keep-baby-boomers-an-essential-talent-resource">invites retired employees</a> to use their experience and institutional knowledge as coaches.</p>
  <p><strong>Underused:</strong> How can you tap into unrecognized skills and capabilities?</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em> The Hilton Worldwide hotel chain keeps records of employee skills, giving the company fast access to people with certain knowledge (such as language fluency) when needed.</p>
  <p>Even some assets that have been conventionally thought of as valuable are being challenged. For example, with the rising population of remote workers, the value of real estate is being questioned. Companies like Shopify and REI Co-op are going mostly remote; REI is even selling its recently built <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/12/rei-seattle-headquarters-commercial-real-estate/">headquarters</a>. Now companies must ask if such assets are really driving the value of business and if they can do business better without them.</p>
  <h2 id="technology-makes-it-easier">Technology makes it easier</h2>
  <p>A capacity capture approach involves identifying an asset or activity and then figuring out how it might be valuable to somebody, somewhere. That could mean, for example, looking to other industries for opportunities. The car company Renault is investigating repurposing batteries that can no longer supply the huge energy demands of its electric cars for less demanding uses, such as <a href="https://easyelectriclife.groupe.renault.com/en/outlook/technology/the-circular-economy-of-the-electric-vehicle-battery/">storage</a> for wind or solar power.</p>
  <p>But finding the right match or use for an untapped asset, particularly outside a company’s own industry, is not an easy task. The main hurdles, says Le Moigne, are usually the risk and investment required. Companies generally prefer to direct investment capital to new production. “When you start such a project, you don’t know what the result will be,” he says. “Companies are not sure they will find a solution, and they’re not sure how expensive the solution will be.”</p>
  <p>But that’s changing.</p>
  <p>Technology platforms increasingly make finding new partnerships and assessing market potential quicker, less risky, and less expensive. Cloud service providers make it straightforward to spin up the back end of a new business venture, for example. Drop-shipping and warehousing services ease access to logistics services. Intermediaries like <a href="https://materialconnexion.com/">Material ConneXion</a> make available a collection of raw and manufactured materials to companies that could use them, while online networks like Upwork and LinkedIn provide a parallel service for peoples’ talents. Together, these and other communication channels and transactional networks connect supply with previously inaccessible demand across industries and physical distance. They lower the bar for trying out a new business model or working with partners in other industries, making the capacity capture opportunities easier to explore.</p>
  <p>Another example is one of Le Moigne’s clients, <a href="https://sourcing.inex-circular.com/">iNex</a>, a startup in Paris that acts as a matchmaker for companies with industrial waste and companies that could use it. “In the past, the waste was valuable, but finding a company that needed it and wanted it was terribly difficult and expensive,” says Le Moigne.</p>

  </p>
  <h2 id="the-case-for-a-chief-capacity-officer">The case for a chief capacity officer</h2>
  <p>The essential work of capacity capture may never happen unless companies make it someone’s job. A chief capacity officer would be in charge of uncovering where value is being lost or is untapped. The role would be to look outside a company’s core competencies, to look at different ways to use fallow assets, and to try to find those with the most potential.</p>
  <p>But this position and its team would need people who can think in truly unexpected and unconventional ways, who can come up with ideas that are, on the surface, almost ridiculous. They would need to be able to look outside a company’s core competencies to spot those unwanted, excess, and underused resources and explore potential for value outside the usual channels. Not everyone has the ability to think like this, so assembling the right team may require counterintuitive choices.</p>
  <p>In fact, a company that develops the expertise in capacity capture can take its capability further by turning the activities into a line of business, helping other companies create their capacity capture mindsets and projects.</p>
  <h2 id="how-to-encourage-the-capacity-capture-mindset">How to encourage the capacity capture mindset</h2>
  <p>During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies and manufacturers that suddenly found their production lines and employees idle came up with ways to contribute to the overwhelming need for PPE. Distilleries made hand sanitizer, clothing factories made medical gowns, and camping outfitters made masks. Other pivots in response to the new normal include office workers, event planners, and entertainers doing business online. Restaurants and shops expanded outdoors into parks and streets. Some of these changes have been temporary, but others have revealed entirely new audiences and ways of working.</p>
  <p>How can we build this way of thinking into everyday business strategy and planning? Here are three moves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Continuously identify untapped resources.</strong> Use the physical, digital, and human categories to stretch your team’s thinking. Keep an ongoing resources list and invite many people to contribute from all parts of your organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Regularly explore potential opportunities.</strong> As part of your strategic planning, ask a diverse group to explore the untapped resources list and generate possibilities for capturing value both inside and outside your organization (see “<a href="#prompts-for-capacity-capture-idea-generation">Prompts for capacity capture idea generation</a>”).</li>
    <li><strong>Reach for the unexpected.</strong> As you analyze the list of resources, suspend disbelief and convention. Look for the seemingly ridiculous ideas – true innovation often feels uncomfortable at first.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This mindset can lead to opportunities when you look hard enough – beermaker BrewDog and its canine treats is one example. Retailer Ikea is another. Its stores are globally consistent – big and flat – and the company has committed to creating as much energy as it uses. So far it has installed 900,000 solar panels on its stores’ roofs. The British Wensleydale Creamery converts its waste from cheesemaking into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/15/wensleydale-cheese-waste-heat-4000-homes-biogas">biogas for home heating</a>. And the grandparent of circular economic activity, the industrial park in <a href="http://www.symbiosis.dk/en/">Kalundborg, Denmark</a>, famously hosts 13 companies that exchange materials like sludge, steam, and fly ash in a cyclical harvest of waste into inputs and energy.</p>

    </picture>
  </p>
  <h2 id="prompts-for-capacity-capture-idea-generation">Prompts for capacity capture idea generation</h2>
  <p><strong>Consider unwanted, excess, and underused materials as assets in the following categories. For each identified resource, ask the following questions to generate potential value:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reuse:</strong> How could it benefit another part of your organization?</li>
    <li><strong>Extend and combine:</strong> What other things could you do with this resource, alone or combined with another resource?</li>
    <li><strong>Spin off:</strong> What could you do with this resource if you removed it from its current context to stand alone?</li>
    <li><strong>Maximize:</strong> How could you create and use even more of this resource?</li>
    <li><strong>Sell:</strong> Under what circumstances might someone else value this resource enough to buy it from your organization?</li>
    <li><strong>Recycle:</strong> How could another organization use this resource when you’re done with it?</li>
    <li><strong>Donate:</strong> Could you create non-monetary value and save the cost of disposal by giving this resource away?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="thinking-flexibly-for-the-future">Thinking flexibly for the future</h2>
  <p>Like Renault, companies that are nimble and successful at capacity capture often are doing it outside their given industry. In fact, the very idea of industries is becoming less relevant. The competitive companies of the future will be operating in several industries, cross-pollinating ideas and innovations. When Renault sells its old batteries outside the automotive industry, is it still a vehicle manufacturer? Or a renewable energy and utility company? Or all of the above?</p>
  <p>The challenges facing companies today – including climate change, shrinking resources, and of course, the pandemic – have also offered an opportunity to embark on a new way of thinking. Flexible exploration of resources and business models is proving critical to connecting with new markets and sustaining organizations through disruptive change. What are your organization’s equivalents of spent grains, flat roof space, or used batteries? Capacity capture offers a way to broaden your thinking about what’s possible, reduce your organization’s footprint, and uncover the value that’s hiding in plain sight.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>The future of the customer experience will be an expression of our deepest instinctive human behaviors – at warp speed and exponential scale – egged on by advances in technology.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The first signal of this shift in the customer experience is in convenience. Humans have continually sought convenience, not only for its own sake but also as a proxy for our inherent desire to create more meaning in our lives. Eliminating tiresome errands gives us more time to do things we consider meaningful, such as being with our families.</p>
  <p>Technology has always powered our quest for convenience. But things are different now because people are no longer companies’ only customers. Artificial intelligence (AI) and the technologies that support it, such as Big Data, cloud, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and machine learning, are becoming researchers, collaborators, augmented assistants, and even proxies for humans in the customer experience.</p>
  <p>These technologies are already causing a huge disruption in the customer experience as humans shift the purchase of mundane items to the background to be managed by machine learning algorithms.</p>
  <p>Any customer experience that does not carry meaning or emotional value risks being relegated to the background to be handled by AIs. Driven only by their interpretation of their human proxies’ best interest, these AIs will test companies’ ability to emotionally connect with customers.</p>
  <p>Beyond the search for meaning, other human instincts, such as creativity, cooperation, and curiosity are finding freer expression through technology.<sup>1</sup></p>
  <p>How will companies survive in a world where customers precisely specify the terms of the relationship – and then completely delegate it to AI? Where they value morality and meaning more than brand names and product features? Where customers multiply their market power through digital tribes or other connected groups?</p>
  <p>As part of a broader series examining life and business in the 21st century, SAP Insights research center worked with more than a dozen industry experts to answer these and other questions, uncovering five trends that will determine the digital customer experience over the next decade:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make way for meaning</li>
    <li>Embracing AI intermediaries</li>
    <li>Customers become contributors</li>
    <li>From markets to mobs</li>
    <li>Values define value</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this report, we examine each of these trends and offer recommendations for how companies should respond now.</p>

  <h2 id="make-way-for-meaning">Make way for meaning</h2>
  <h3 id="increasingly-customers-are-choosing-experiences-that-have-meaning-and-delegating-the-rest-to-ai">Increasingly, customers are choosing experiences that have meaning and delegating the rest to AI.</h3>
  <p>Businesses must shift their emphasis from the routine to the sublime.</p>
  <p>Call it the revolution of meaning. Almost everything – from Facebook to yoga classes to self-help books – is training an exploding global middle class, with 160 million new members each year,<sup>2</sup> to seek more meaning from their daily lives, something that humans yearn for instinctively.<sup>3</sup></p>
  <p>Companies must still fulfill the old customer expectations – quality products and services delivered with efficiency and good customer service – but they must now also focus on what customers wish their lives to be.</p>
  <p>Any portion of the customer experience that does not deliver an emotionally fulfilling sense of value will move to the background (see “<a href="#embracing-ai-intermediaries">Embracing AI intermediaries</a>”), where set-it-and-forget-it algorithms will take over.</p>
  <p>Technologies such as machine learning, cloud computing, and IoT sensors are driving anything perceived as humdrum or repetitive into an automated background customer experience. But the good news is that those same technologies also open new possibilities for companies to make different parts of the experience more meaningful than it is today.</p>
  <h3 id="though-there-are-as-many-definitions-of-meaningful-experiences-as-there-are-people-for-companies-these-experiences-fit-into-four-broad-categories">Though there are as many definitions of meaningful experiences as there are people, for companies, these experiences fit into four broad categories:</h3>
  <p><strong>Entertainment.</strong></p>
  <p>In malls in California, Florida, Nevada, and the United Kingdom this year, shoppers donned virtual reality (VR) headsets and wandered through a custom-made, haptic-technology-enabled space designed to give them the sensation of being in a <em>Star Wars</em> movie. The experience got great reviews.<sup>4</sup> The lines separating consumer brands, retailers, and entertainment will continue to blur, as evidenced by the success of movies and YouTube features that are basically extensions of commercials or video games.<sup>5</sup></p>
  <p><strong>Connection.</strong><br>In small towns, people used to go to the butcher or general store not just to stock up on essentials but also to fill up on gossip about their neighbors. Big-box retailers made those connective experiences inefficient. But as machine learning and online retailing grab the reins of efficiency away, retailers could counter by creating new ways for people to connect with other people and with their communities. Using technologies such as VR, augmented reality (AR), and AI, high-end retailers could become 21st-century nightclubs, for example, while the state fair or sports arena could become a new mall.</p>
  <p><strong>Learning.</strong><br>Businesses must take advantage of our fascination with understanding how things work to create or extend a meaningful relationship with customers. Improving customers’ mastery of a product makes it more meaningful to them. For cellphone makers now competing on the quality of their cameras, that means offering photography classes both in stores and at home through technologies like VR and AR, for example.</p>
  <p><strong>Aspiration.</strong><br>The alignment of selling with a core human aspiration could explain why the number of mindfulness and fitness centers in malls has doubled in the last five years.<sup>6</sup> It also explains why health and fitness tracking apps have become popular, as customers seek ways to monitor progress and share their aspirations with a larger community.</p>
  <h3 id="what-can-your-business-do">What can your business do?</h3>
  <p><strong>If meaning isn’t there, create it.</strong><br>Businesses that don’t already offer a meaningful element to the experience will be pushed to the background by customers or efficiency-seeking AIs acting on their behalf. If an element of meaning is there, businesses need to double down on increasing it to protect themselves from competitors. They can use emerging technologies to expand the boundaries of the experience or go completely beyond those boundaries to take their products or services into another space where meaningful experiences already exist.</p>
  <p><strong>Curate, don’t control.</strong><br>In a world where customers can shout out whatever they want to a voice-activated AI assistant, owning the entire customer experience is impossible. Curation is the next best thing. It helps customers cut through the noise and shows off a business’ ability to pull the best stuff together, let’s say, as a subscription package, even if some of the curation must be done by others (such as a niche brand with highly specific expertise in a certain area).</p>
  <p><strong>Remove the distractions.</strong><br>Once the core meaning proposition has been identified, automate away everything that distracts customers from the most meaningful elements of the experience.</p>
  <p><strong>Provide a platform to create meaning.</strong><br>Companies can produce technology platforms that enable meaning for relatively little cost. In the fitness realm, for example, companies are providing platforms for developers to create apps that let users feel connected through data such as personal bests, crowdsourced routes, and “king of the hill” competitions.</p>

  <h2 id="embracing-ai-intermediaries">Embracing AI intermediaries</h2>
  <h3 id="ai-engines-are-the-new-intermediaries-between-companies-and-customers-in-the-buying-decision">AI engines are the new intermediaries between companies and customers in the buying decision.</h3>
  <p>The complexities of modern life are driving our brains into cognitive overload. To cope, customers are pulling AI engines close, relying on their recommendations while pushing traditional brand interactions into the background.</p>
  <p>We happily accept the shows Netflix suggests, the music Spotify plays, the cleaning regime Roomba chooses, and the results Google displays. We have become so trusting of the choices these machine learning systems make that 35% of Amazon purchases and 75% of Netflix selections are driven by machine learning recommendations, according to McKinsey.<sup>7</sup></p>
  <p>Why? Because customers are increasingly distinguishing between aspects of the customer experience that are routine and those that have meaning (see “<a href="#make-way-for-meaning">Make way for meaning</a>”). As AI’s accuracy and utility continue to increase, customers will offload the thinking for decisions that they deem unimportant to AI engines. Companies that fall into the “unimportant” category will be pushed farther from their customers and will be forced to engage customers through AI assistants acting as gatekeepers.</p>
  <h3 id="ai-intermediaries-are-pushing-businesses-into-the-background-in-several-ways">AI intermediaries are pushing businesses into the background in several ways:</h3>
  <p><strong>More work will be done in the background.</strong></p>
  <p>With AI systems capable of gathering, indexing, and analyzing mountains of data, customers feel increasingly comfortable that AI bots can interpret their personal preferences and make choices on their behalf. Background research conducted by AI engines will soon expand to background shopping completed by AI assistants.</p>
  <p><strong>What’s love got to do with it?</strong><br>Emotional marketing appeals can create loyal humans, but not loyal AI engines. As customers turn over routine buying decisions to AI assistants, businesses will need new strategies for winning over their automated audience.</p>
  <p><strong>Task boundaries will disappear.</strong><br>Mundane chores are often grouped into discrete bundles, such as cleaning the house or paying the bills. These boundaries will disappear as AI-enabled machines take on many different chores at once. Companies that can’t adapt to AI task masters will lose customers.</p>

  <h3 id="how-can-your-business-adapt">How can your business adapt?</h3>
  <p><strong>Become your industry’s AI intermediary.</strong><br>Build a specialist AI engine that brings unique knowledge to customers. Co-opt AI capabilities to make that specialized knowledge and skills available to customers directly and through generalist AI assistants.</p>
  <p><strong>AI-enable products.</strong><br>As customer touch points are pushed into the background, products will play a more central role as brand ambassadors. Use Big Data, IoT sensors, and machine learning to improve the experience for customers by increasing delight, reducing cognitive load, and eliminating unnecessary actions. Find ways to create a human connection to customers through products.</p>
  <p><strong>Optimize AI shelf placement.</strong><br>General AI-based systems will be the next digital “shelf space” for optimizing product placement. While it is very early days for AI engine optimization, expand the focus of existing search engine optimization teams to establish leadership early on. Fact-based, information-driven product and service descriptions will drive success through AI intermediaries.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhance human-to-human touchpoints.</strong><br>Use AI-based tools to mediate customer interactions by looking for ways to augment frontline employees with customer insights and communication suggestions. For instance, analytics and machine learning can be used to feed employees deep insights into individual customers, improving the personalization of customer interactions.</p>

  <h2 id="customers-become-contributors">Customers become contributors</h2>
  <h3 id="businesses-are-creating-open-platforms-where-customers-can-participate-in-all-aspects-of-the-experience-both-actively-and-passively">Businesses are creating open platforms where customers can participate in all aspects of the experience, both actively and passively.</h3>
  <p>Customers are no longer content to be merely recipients of goods and services; they have become embedded in the business model itself.</p>
  <p>Customers’ participation can be active, in which they contribute to design, production, marketing, and ways of using products and services. Their participation can also be passive, with them agreeing to let companies use their data to formulate and deliver products and services for them.</p>
  <p>Either way, businesses can’t survive without creating data platforms that encourage both active and passive customer participation in the development of products, services, and the overall experience. Unlike classic data repositories that serve only companies, these open platforms provide value both to customers and the business.</p>
  <p>For example, rather than making customers wait for the next release of a food tracking or recipe app, companies have created open platforms where users can add new foods, food products, and recipes for others to search for and use. The food and recipe companies improve customer loyalty and create exponential scalability for their platform with little additional investment.</p>
  <p>All this data gives the food companies invaluable information about how and where to expand their businesses. The platform becomes the basis of the business itself and provides abundant customer insights to apply toward future strategic direction.</p>
  <p>Other companies, from farming equipment suppliers to jet engine makers, are also creating platforms that track customers’ usage and invite participation. As these platforms become smarter and as more features are added, participation becomes easier, creating a virtuous cycle. In return for giving businesses their creativity and expertise, customers expect to receive better products and services, naturally, but they also enjoy the status, recognition, and feelings of belonging and meaning that come with contributing to something they care about.</p>
  <h3 id="here-are-four-ways-customers-increasingly-expect-to-contribute">Here are four ways customers increasingly expect to contribute:</h3>
  <p><strong>As users.</strong><br>The most successful companies are now making customer data part of the experience itself, giving customers direct, instant value from it. Fitness trackers, for instance, used to be the experience. Now they are input devices that feed data platforms so that customers can enjoy much richer experiences than they could from just the device, such as personal bests, crowdsourced competitions, meet-ups, and route sharing.</p>
  <p><strong>As creators.</strong><br>Companies are providing digital platforms to unleash customer creativity. Rather than making customers wait for the next release of their video game, for example, producers are releasing open platforms where gamers can create new levels and modules for the whole community to use. Others allow customers to suggest new product designs.</p>
  <p><strong>As producers.</strong><br>Customers are actively contributing to the making of products. For instance, renewable energy systems let customers who generate excess electricity sell it to the grid, while online meal providers deliver the ingredients and instructions for customers to make their meals themselves at home (Nothing delivers meaning more than a home-cooked meal with the family, right?).</p>
  <p><strong>As sustainers.</strong><br>Customers increasingly prefer companies that let them be active, visible participants in the “three R’s” (reduce, reuse, recycle) and recommerce programs.<sup>8</sup> Products that can be easily repurposed, resold, or dismantled and recycled bring satisfaction to those concerned about climate change, especially as the three R’s become an increasingly moral issue for more customers (see “<a href="#values-define-value">Values define value</a>”).</p>
  <h3 id="what-are-your-businesss-next-steps">What are your business’s next steps?</h3>
  <p><strong>Create value from passive participation.</strong><br>Customers are often fine with turning over their data in return for something of value, especially if they don’t have to do anything. For example, after obtaining customer permission to access banking and credit card data, financial companies use machine learning algorithms, analytics, and massive data repositories to create useful investment reports without customers having to lift a finger.</p>
  <p><strong>Shift from delivering end products to delivering open platforms.</strong><br>Think of customers as full partners, able to participate at any point in the value chain. Leave a portion of the product for them to tinker with, such as open online video games, or even to fulfill, such as meal services where customers make the meals themselves. Make a long-term commitment to shared ownership of the business through collaboration with customers, other businesses, and curation.</p>
  <p><strong>Master the quid pro quo.</strong><br>Be clear about the value customers receive for their contributions to the value chain. Creative expression, community connection, recognition, and personalized experiences, in addition to the value in the product itself, are all examples of what customers could receive.</p>

  <h2 id="from-markets-to-mobs">From markets to mobs</h2>
  <h3 id="markets-of-individual-customers-enabled-by-platforms-and-algorithms-can-now-instantly-become-an-outspoken-tribe-for-collective-and-cooperative-action">Markets of individual customers, enabled by platforms and algorithms, can now instantly become an outspoken tribe for collective and cooperative action.</h3>
  <p>Technology is making it ever easier for customers to discover one another and to organize into infinite numbers of demanding, sometimes mutinous, digital tribes.</p>
  <p>These tribes often form at a moment’s notice and grow exponentially at near-zero cost. We see it in the way individual stories go viral and in how companies can face, almost overnight, mobs that take action in ways that cannot easily be managed.</p>
  <p>Creating and sharing social objects is at the heart of this revolution in digital tribes.<sup>9</sup> Digital tribes were initially based on shared interests and formed around online watering holes such as newsgroups and their digitally powered artifacts, posts. These days, digital social objects take all sorts of forms, such as tweets, photos, peer reviews, and status updates—just about anything that draws mass interest and participation and that can be shared easily.</p>
  <p>For example, over 140,000 global communities have formed on Reddit, covering the serious to the utterly obscure. A 71,000-member group shares pictures of those little knobs on the bottom of animals’ paws (a.k.a., jelly bean toes).</p>
  <p>The ease with which groups like this can form, communicate, and act means that these social tribes aren’t always just for fun. Some are formed explicitly to cause change or disrupt companies. TV watchers, for example, have successfully brought back shows from the dead, lobbied to kill off those they don’t like, and demanded that some be rewritten.</p>
  <p>To be successful, businesses must become adept at creating social objects that matter to digital groups and, by extension, become the centerpiece of the group’s functioning. It’s a fine balance: businesses must avoid earning a group’s ire and becoming the object of their scorn.</p>
  <h3 id="customers-are-banding-together-to-affect-companies-in-four-ways">Customers are banding together to affect companies in four ways:</h3>
  <p><strong>Use products as social objects.</strong><br>Several online gaming companies have spawned participative tribes by turning their games into social objects. Gamers can share strategies, create new versions of the games, and play them together. Music services turn favorite playlists into social objects that are easily shared with others looking for that killer party mix.</p>
  <p><strong>Make informed decisions.</strong><br>Today’s review sites are often used by people to praise or decry a company based on their experiences. Others use those reviews to determine which product to buy. Increasingly, AI-enabled digital tribes will form to share opinions, tips, best practices, and personal stories around shared interests.</p>
  <p><strong>Pool resources.</strong><br>Data platforms enable customers to group together to purchase items at a discounted price. Coupon-based platforms secure discounted prices for minimum quantities set by the supplier. Crowdfunding sites let customers draw attention to a charitable cause or provide backing to develop new products; in return for their upfront cash, funders typically receive the new product when it launches.</p>
  <p><strong>Trigger AI bots to work collectively.</strong><br>Tasked by customers to secure the best price, AI bots could collaborate to collectively barter and purchase goods in the future. AI bots will learn how to seek out and enlist other AI bots to help serve the best interests of all their customers.</p>

  <h3 id="heres-what-your-company-can-do-next">Here’s what your company can do next:</h3>
  <p><strong>Make social sharing natural.</strong><br>Use Big Data and IoT sensors to design social objects into your products, digital platforms, and online presences that people want to create and share. Shift from creating and controlling all relevant corporate content to cultivating your company’s tribes to share content that benefits the company as part of their social connections.</p>
  <p><strong>Become the center of your tribe’s orbit.</strong><br>Your product is an opportunity to be the purpose for a tribe, providing meaningful ways for people to connect. For example, many fitness device makers use apps to create tribes around the devices and to scale connection through digital platforms.</p>
  <p><strong>Help tribes find meaning.</strong><br>Help digital tribes understand what they want to be, champion their values, and facilitate how they get there. Several apparel companies, for example, have tapped into their tribes’ desires to make a difference in the world, where buying a product also gives to communities in need.</p>

  <h3 id="digital-transparency-is-turning-customer-decisions-that-were-once-seen-as-personal-or-aesthetic-choices-into-moral-choices">Digital transparency is turning customer decisions that were once seen as personal or aesthetic choices into moral choices.</h3>
  <p>Customers used to make decisions based on attributes such as quality and value. Increasingly, they now make decisions based on whether businesses think and act like them.</p>
  <p>Think of it as the rise of the moral purchase decision.</p>
  <p>Social media and digital platforms enable companies to quickly and transparently monitor what’s important to customers. New fashion trends, for example, spread across the world in hours, not days or weeks. Social media also enables customers to easily connect with others anywhere in the world who share their beliefs and ideologies.</p>
  <p>Technology platforms have created a global consciousness about global issues, including climate change, violence, and human rights. Meanwhile, social media and digital technology are creating ever greater transparency into companies’ operations, allowing customers to easily learn about their values. Customers then decide on brands and products that reflect their own values.</p>
  <h3 id="expanding-digital-transparency-lets-customers-evaluate-the-values-of-businesses-across-three-major-categories">Expanding digital transparency lets customers evaluate the values of businesses across three major categories:</h3>
  <p><strong>Aesthetic values</strong> influence the pleasure and displeasure we get from things such as music, fashion, and design. Social platforms spread people’s aesthetic choices further and faster, causing aesthetic-based trends to shift faster than ever.</p>
  <p><strong>Personal values</strong> determine feelings about health, lifestyle, and relationships. Customers expect businesses to tailor products to their personal values as increased customization and personalization become possible.</p>
  <p><strong>Moral values</strong>, such as honesty, fairness, and compassion, define what individuals believe to be right and wrong. Brand alignment with moral values is taking greater precedence in customer decisions.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Social platforms are creating a greater awareness of human challenges around the globe, such as access to food and water, climate change, and risk of violence. That awareness gives moral values increased weight in customer decisions. For instance, what was once an aesthetic choice about shoe style is increasingly a choice to stop forced labor and make a difference.</p>
  <p>Transparency is pushing businesses to take positions. Customers are realizing that, through their spending power, they can influence businesses (see “<a href="#from-markets-to-mobs">From markets to mobs</a>”) to visibly support the values they care about. Two-thirds of consumers say that they will support companies that they believe make a positive difference in society.<sup>10</sup> And a growing number of consumers are punishing companies whose values they disagree with.<sup>11</sup> Clearly the stakes for companies are high and growing.</p>
  <h3 id="to-align-your-business-with-moral-purchase-decisions">To align your business with moral purchase decisions:</h3>
  <p><strong>Understand the market’s moral values.</strong><br>Companies must integrate a deep understanding of their target market’s moral values into product design and provide ways for customers to share those values by making statements. Surface and express values in every part of the experience, from packaging or materials indicating product origin to digital scorecards capturing the company’s commitment to key causes.</p>
  <p><strong>Reflect moral values across the business.</strong><br>Customers know if businesses are being authentic. Tap emerging technologies to provide transparency into material sources, labor conditions, environmental impact, and good stewardship within local communities. For instance, blockchain can help ensure compliance across supplier networks.</p>
  <p><strong>Take a stand together.</strong><br>Stake out visible, public positions on issues that employees and customers care about. Develop programs that encourage partnership around a shared mission and use digital platforms to scale impact. For example, utility smart meters show a commitment to helping customers save energy together. “Buy one, give one” programs embed the partnership directly into the transaction.</p>
  <p><strong>Make your customers the heroes.</strong><br>Communicate success in a way that highlights the impact made by customers, with your business in a supporting role. Develop platforms that allow customers to see their impact directly. For example, IoT sensors can monitor product usage so that customers can share their accomplishments on social media.</p>

  <p><strong>The rooftop of a big-box store is:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>A flat expanse of hundreds of square feet exposed to the weather</li>
    <li>A great, if not perfect, way to protect what’s inside from that weather</li>
    <li>A power source for the building, and maybe for the neighbors, too</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If you’re the Ingka Group, which owns IKEA, the answer is “all of the above.” As part of its commitment to use only renewable energy by 2020, the Ingka Group installed 900,000 solar modules on the roofs of IKEA stores and warehouses around the world, turning what would otherwise be vacant space into a literal powerhouse. These solar installations generated 155 GWh of electricity in 2018, enough to supply nearly 5% of IKEA’s global energy needs. In fact, according to Karol Gobczyński, the Ingka Group’s head of climate and energy, some locations are generating enough solar power to sell some back to the local electrical grid.</p>
  <p>What holds companies back from coming up with breakthroughs like this in a systematic, repeatable way?</p>
  <p>A failure of perspective.</p>
  <p>Methodologies like Six Sigma and technologies like sharing platforms and AI-driven analytics are powerful tools to uncover new opportunities, but they are held back by outdated thinking. If they weren’t, digital transformations wouldn’t fail up to 80% of the time, and they’d meet or exceed expectations more than just 5% of the time. To be truly transformative – in other words, to get more than just incremental returns on investment – companies need to combine technology with a new way of thinking about what value is and where to find it.</p>
  <p>Massive value is lying fallow in excess resources, like unused real estate, over-purchased software, and employees who aren’t being used to their full potential (people themselves are never excess). It’s concealed in underused resources, like vehicles that are on the road only a few hours a day, computing cycles that whir away pointlessly at night, and employees with untapped skills. It’s hiding in things that, according to current wisdom, have no value whatsoever, like production waste, “<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3070475/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-data-exhaust.html">data exhaust</a>,” and people who move on to other employers.</p>
  <p>But waiting for the hidden value in these resources to reveal itself practically guarantees that it will remain unseen. Companies need to adopt a new mindset for systematically seeking out resources so they can extract more value from existing investments and encourage the development of potential new products, services, and business models. In other words, they need a capacity capture mindset.</p>

  <h2 id="broadening-the-search-for-value">Broadening the search for value</h2>
  <p>The traditional business approach assumes that resources are too specialized to be reused or deployed in new ways. The capacity capture mindset, on the other hand, starts with the assumption that resources are ubiquitous and infinite, because anything can be a resource, and any resource has capacity for value beyond its primary or original purpose.</p>
  <p>Capacity capture is about actively identifying resources that are underused, wasted, or discarded and coming up with ways to recapture, use, sell, or otherwise monetize them. Consider how much money real estate companies invest in building and maintaining parking lots in office parks, even though the parking spaces sit empty for 12 or more hours a day. In Europe, a technology platform that lets long-haul truck drivers reserve those spots overnight has created a new income stream for the office parks. At the same time, it gives drivers safer places to sleep than highway shoulders and on-ramps, which protects the drivers, their cargo, and everyone else on the road.</p>
  <p>Capacity capture allows organizations to discover new areas of innovation that end up delivering bigger benefits than just resource efficiency. Imagine a factory that actively looks for ways to generate more heat during production because it can make more money by selling or repurposing that heat than it can save by minimizing it. In the Danish town of Kalundborg, for example, <a href="https://we-economy.net/case-stories/kalundborg-symbiosis.html">13 different companies in the local industrial park</a> use an elaborate system of pipelines to exchange materials and energy. Sludge, steam, and fly ash that are waste for some become valuable input for others, lowering the cost of energy and raw materials for everyone while reducing the amount and expense of waste disposal.</p>
  <p>Using the capacity capture mindset, companies can also find ways to make their products more effective by capturing and using what would otherwise be considered waste. For example, MIT and Stanford scientists have invented a way to expand the capacity of rechargeable batteries by warming them while they’re first charging. A battery manufacturer could theoretically do this by capturing waste heat from the manufacturing process and then selling these higher-capacity batteries at a premium. Kohler, the tile company, is already doing something along these lines by <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-kohler-turned-production-waste-new-tile-line">repurposing waste</a> from its tile manufacturing process, including broken tiles, cast iron slag, and leftover glazes, and using them to create a new line of designer tile.</p>
  <p>The capacity capture mindset also encourages a deeper examination of experience as a resource. Just look at the Dutch city of Rotterdam, home to Europe’s largest industrial port and, like most of the Netherlands, below sea level. Rotterdam has tapped its underused wealth of institutional expertise in preventing and managing flooding to launch a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/15/world/europe/climate-change-rotterdam.html">consulting business</a>. In guiding other coastal cities on how to cope with rising sea waters and worsening storms in the face of climate change, the city collects extra funding for the city budget, which in turn supports further innovations in flood-resistant urban renewal.</p>
  <h2 id="defining-the-search-grid-body">Defining the search grid body</h2>
  <p>The first step to capturing capacity is to understand what capacity is and where it might be found.</p>
  <h3 id="types-of-assets">Types of assets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical assets</strong> are tangible objects of any kind, from facilities and heavy equipment to lighting and office supplies.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital assets</strong> include network infrastructure, software, data and metadata, and bandwidth.</li>
    <li><strong>Human assets</strong> are people and their behaviors.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="areas-of-untapped-capacity">Areas of untapped capacity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unwanted assets</strong> are assets that are created or accumulated unintentionally or incidentally as a side effect or byproduct of another process.</li>
    <li><strong>Excess assets</strong> are produced or gathered intentionally but become surplus either because there are too many of them or because the process that produced or gathered them is no longer in use.</li>
    <li><strong>Underused assets</strong> are created intentionally and are in use but not to their full potential.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following framework gives examples of these asset types and capacities and the questions a company might ask itself to discover them:</p>
  <div class="table">
    <div>
      <div>Asset Type</div>
      <div>Unwanted</div>
      <div>Excess</div>
      <div>Underused</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Physical</div>
      <div>What is created unintentionally as a side effect and then discarded? Examples include trash, offcuts, steam, and heat.</div>
      <div>What is produced intentionally but becomes surplus? Examples include products, energy, and materials.</div>
      <div>What kinds of existing assets go unused? Examples include space, vehicles, and equipment.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Digital</div>
      <div>What is collected incidentally and rarely used or analyzed? Examples include sensor readings, metadata, and data exhaust.</div>
      <div>What is developed or gathered intentionally but rarely used? Examples include software functionality, infrastructure, and legacy data.</div>
      <div>What kinds of existing storage and channels go unused? Examples include computing cycles, bandwidth, and repositories.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Human</div>
      <div>Where are people or their behaviors seen as undesirable? Examples include former employees and prohibited behaviors.</div>
      <div>Where do you gather people or encourage behaviors but then not use them fully? Examples include job roles, training, and passion.</div>
      <div>How can you tap into unrecognized skills and capabilities? Examples include surveying employees for unused skills, matching personal goals with needed capabilities, and partnering employees with others.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The boundaries between these different types of assets can be porous. For example, some physical assets also have characteristics of digital assets, as with autonomous vehicles. Some digital assets, such as servers and storage media, may be thought of as physical assets. What’s more, physical and digital assets often enhance human assets, a convergence that will accelerate as technologies evolve.</p>
  <p>As a result, many assets will overlap several categories, and the process of considering where they might fit can generate further possibilities.</p>

  <h2 id="categories-of-capacity-capture-in-action">Categories of capacity capture in action</h2>
  <p>Each square of the capacity capture grid represents myriad possibilities for finding or creating more value. The following examples describe just a few opportunities that companies in a range of industries have uncovered.</p>
  <h3 id="physical-assets">Physical assets</h3>
  <p><strong>Unwanted.</strong> The UK’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/15/wensleydale-cheese-waste-heat-4000-homes-biogas">Wensleydale Creamery</a> works with a nearby bioenergy plant to turn the waste whey from its world-famous cheese into enough renewable biogas to heat 4,000 homes in the Yorkshire Dales. The bioenergy plant, which also processes leftovers from a nearby ice cream factory, pumps the natural gas from food waste back into the gas grid. What remains becomes fertilizer for local farmland.</p>
  <p><strong>Excess.</strong> Several European utility companies are working with automakers Nissan and Mitsubishi to develop services that let people sell the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-electric-vehicles-charging-grid-analy/european-power-firms-aim-to-harness-electric-car-batteries-idUSKCN1PF0IT">energy stored in their electric vehicle</a> (EV) batteries back to the grid. Today, the return on the extra juice is limited, but as batteries continue their Moore’s Law-like improvement in cost and power, people who charge their EV batteries during off-peak times and sell power back to the grid during peak times could end up charging their cars for free – or even making a profit.</p>
  <p><strong>Underused.</strong> As early as 2012, Coca-Cola began partnering with pharmaceutical companies to deliver vaccines in developing countries using the existing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/skollworldforum/2013/04/08/soda-pop-and-vaccines-leveraging-consumer-supply-chains-to-promote-public-health-and-economic-uplift/">refrigerated trucks and supply chain know-how</a> that have made its products available around the world. By fitting medical perishables into the empty space in trucks that deliver soft drinks, the company reduced vaccine delivery times and increased the number of people getting vaccinated while boosting its brand reputation.</p>
  <h3 id="digital-assets">Digital assets</h3>
  <p><strong>Unwanted.</strong> Companies of all types are offering data they collect that is incidental to their primary business models to other organizations who mine it for value. For example, health insurer UnitedHealth Group provides aggregated data from its claim forms to drug companies seeking insight into how their products are being used. This secondary income stream has been so successful that the resulting spinoff, Optum, has been more <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/secret-weapon-unitedhealths-optum-business-laying-waste-old-notions-about-how-payers-make-money">profitable and faster-growing</a> than UnitedHealth itself.</p>
  <p><strong>Excess.</strong> As more streetlights are fitted with LED bulbs to reduce costs and save energy, it turns out that they can do more than their centuries-old roles of guiding travelers and making pedestrians safer. Visible light communication, or <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3214670/how-wi-fi-could-get-a-boost-from-li-fi.html">Li-Fi</a>, transmits data by switching individual LED bulbs on and off at nanosecond speeds, much faster than the human eye can detect, so that the lights can still do their primary jobs while transmitting data at rates <a href="https://www.lifi-centre.com/about-li-fi/applications/">1,000 times faster</a> than traditional Wi-Fi over short distances.</p>
  <p><strong>Underused.</strong> Amazon famously created a significant new business model, Amazon Web Services, by renting out unused capacity on its flexible computing infrastructure. It’s now captured that capacity for a second time by creating a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html">marketplace</a> where it charges a 12% service fee to customers who are reselling their reserved but unused cloud instances.</p>
  <h3 id="human-assets">Human assets</h3>
  <p>When we talk about unwanted or excess human assets, we’re talking about roles, skills, and behaviors, not the people themselves. All people are valuable; indeed, they’re the only constant resource companies have, and digital and physical resources have no value without them. People can change their value throughout their lives through ongoing learning and development. It’s time to jettison the idea that someone stops being valuable when the workplace changes and instead quantify their value based on what they’re capable of doing and what they’re willing to do to keep pace with change.</p>
  <p><strong>Unwanted.</strong> Just a few years ago, employees could be disciplined or even fired for using their smartphone at a corporate event. At best, it was considered rude, and at worst, it was viewed as a potential breach of company security. Today, organizations actively encourage employees to brandish their phones to promote conference panels and other events on social media in real time.</p>
  <p><strong>Excess.</strong> Many companies make decisions about whether to lay off high-salary employees to cut costs by looking at their roles in isolation, without considering how those employees enhance the value of the people they work for and with. Finding a way to capture and quantify the value of an employee’s contribution to the organization will encourage companies to consider whether letting someone go will cost the company more than it saves. Similarly, companies can reduce retirement-driven brain drain by inviting retiring employees to become “business angels” who coach new teams. They could even partner with similar companies in a consortium that captures the untapped value of people who just missed being hired by sharing these candidates with and recommending them to each other.</p>
  <p><strong>Underused.</strong> The Hilton Worldwide hotel chain keeps a record of every employee’s specific skills, such as language ability and local connections, even if those skills aren’t immediately relevant or used in the employee’s current role. That gives the company fast access to internal people when they are most needed. For example, if the company plans to open a hotel in a new location it can easily search for an employee who is a native speaker of the language and has connections in that market.</p>

  <h2 id="identifying-capacity">Identifying capacity</h2>
  <p>Capacity capture begins with a deliberate focus on expanding your thinking about where you might find value beyond increasing efficiency and reducing waste, as well as suspending any disbelief about what constitutes a resource or how resources can or should be used. As you use the above grid to identify possible resources, ask other people in your organization, in every department and at every level, to do the same. Insight can come from anyone, and the people who are closest to the resources are the ones most likely to recognize the value in them.</p>
  <p>Once you’ve developed a list of potential resources, don’t get bogged down in trying to evaluate them all at once or even in groups. Focus on each one with the presumption that it’s inherently valuable and that your job is to determine its value.</p>
  <p>As you assess each potential resource, consider how you might extract the value:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reuse.</strong> How could it benefit another part of your organization? Extend and combine. What other things could you do with this resource, alone or combined with another resource?</li>
    <li><strong>Spin off.</strong> What could you do with this resource if you removed it from its current context to stand alone?</li>
    <li><strong>Maximize.</strong> How could you create and use even more of this resource?</li>
    <li><strong>Sell.</strong> Under what circumstances might someone else value this resource enough to buy it from your organization?</li>
    <li><strong>Recycle.</strong> How could another organization use this resource when you’re done with it?</li>
    <li><strong>Donate.</strong> Could you create nonmonetary value, and save the cost of disposal, by giving this resource away?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It isn’t as odd as it may seem to take this approach to human assets as well as physical or digital assets. Your company already knows how to reuse people’s skills by shifting them to other departments and maximize them by providing more training. It could just as easily spin off a group of especially unconventional thinkers into a skunkworks or “donate them” by encouraging them to share their skills with volunteer organizations.</p>
  <p>This process is intended to generate ideas through rapid iteration and participation from a variety of people across the organization. There are no wrong answers, only creative possibilities.</p>
  <p>As with other transformations, it makes sense to begin experimenting with capacity capture in one small, distinct area as a proof of concept. Setting up new business models – especially outside of a company’s existing industry – used to be a huge hurdle, but emerging technologies and technology-enabled platforms (think Airbnb, Lyft, and Spotify) make it more affordable to experiment and test the market. A small-scale, iterative approach that keeps the cost of entry low lets you continually spin up new opportunities instead of passing on something promising because you lack the visibility and depth of understanding about its potential.</p>

  <h2 id="capacity-capture-as-strategic-imperative">Capacity capture as strategic imperative</h2>
  <p>It’s critical to note that while technology enables capacity capture, the concept isn’t technology driven. Rather, it’s a mindset of looking for opportunities, like selling data gathered through tracking or creating platforms that connect customers with each other, and then choosing tools based on the opportunities that arise.</p>
  <p>Another key aspect of the capacity capture mindset is that you aren’t trapped (or protected) by your existing business model or industry. If your explorations uncover a newfound opportunity that you don’t want to ignore but also don’t want to make your primary focus, you may decide to pursue it through a joint venture with an existing partner, a company you wouldn’t ordinarily have a reason to do business with, or even a competitor.</p>
  <p>As business shifts to a capacity mindset, it could make sense to carve out a top management role – maybe even a chief capacity officer position – with ultimate responsibility for identifying capacity throughout the organization and driving innovative projects to capture it for business benefit.</p>
  <p>This role would require a knowledge of where end-to-end processes are and what they need, credibility with colleagues across functions, and the ability to think creatively. A business leader with established ideas about the <em>right</em> way to run an organization may not be as good a fit for the role as someone with talent and enthusiasm for spotting unused or overlooked resources in their own, and other, departments.</p>
  <p>A company fortunate to have multiple people with the necessary skills may decide to create a capacity capture team. An organization that develops expertise in capacity capture may even develop or spin off a consultancy that helps other businesses shift their own thinking around resources, as the city of Rotterdam did with its water containment knowledge. That is itself an opportunity to capture underused human capacity.</p>
  <p>Researchers at the Global Footprint network say the human race now consumes renewable resources at <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-just-used-up-all-of-earth-s-resources-for-the-year-and-it-s-only-july">almost twice the rate</a> the earth can replenish them. Capacity capture provides an alternative to working within the limitations of what we perceive as our available resources. It lets us question our perceptions – and therefore our limitations – about what we have to work with in the first place.</p>
