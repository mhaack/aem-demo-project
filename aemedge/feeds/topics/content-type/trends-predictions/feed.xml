  <p>By SAP Insights</p>
  <p>We're back and at it again – doling out predictions for the year ahead like the all-seeing business psychics that we are.</p>
  <p>Okay, fine. Busted. We immersed ourselves in the deluge of trend reports for 2024 from all the sources we could find and extracted the stuff you really need to know.</p>
  <p>Because isn’t the world just something else right now? Never a dull moment and all that and, as much as we would all love a few dull moments at the moment, 2024 doesn’t seem to be the year that will happen.</p>
  <p>Read on and prepare yourself.</p>
  <h2 id="trend-1-everything-ai">TREND 1: Everything AI</h2>
  <p><strong>It’s 9 a.m. Do you know what your developers are doing?</strong> Here’s a hint: They’re using generative AI (GenAI) for programming. Considering the cohort we’re talking about, this is unsurprising. Historically, this group has always jumped on new tech. Now, whether they have permission to do so is another matter. Most companies don’t have AI policies yet. Will they stop developers from using GenAI? Unlikely. (<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/">O’Reilly</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Why use off-the-rack when you can go couture?</strong> Last year was like the kiddie wading pool version of GenAI. Everyone jumped in, splashed around, yelled at the top of their lungs with glee, and kinda made a mess. This is the year to jump in the deep end, and that means considering industry-specific AI models that are trained on data that’s more relevant and useful to the business than just pictures of cats and dogs. Domain-specific large language models (LLMs) are trained specifically on, say, types of medical or legal data. One size definitely does not fit all. (<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/xe/en/insights/focus/tech-trends.html">Deloitte Tech Trends 2024</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Trust you, trust AI.</strong> Introducing AI tools to the workplace can be a touchy subject. But it turns out that when engaged workers trust the companies they work for, that equals more openness to AI in all its wondrous manifestations. What employees everywhere want is to use AI, but not be managed by it. Last year, we saw GenAI take off at a breakneck speed – and with very few guardrails. In 2024? Expect guardrails in company policies about the when, how, and why of using GenAI, including broader laws and higher expectations. (<a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/ebooks-guides/2024-ex-trends-report/">Qualtrics: 2024 Employee Experience Trends</a>; <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/">O’Reilly</a>)</p>

        <h3 id="no-more-irresponsible-use-of-ai">No more irresponsible use of AI</h3>
        <p>Narrow the gap between aspiration and action when it comes to responsible AI.</p>

  </div>
  <p>INSIGHTS’S ADVICE:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hey! Let’s be careful out there.</strong> You need GenAI guidelines before employees get a bit <em>too</em> creative in using it – like maybe don’t use it for legal briefs – but also be realistic. Some workers (developers) will be more inclined to experiment and there are ways to encourage that safely.</li>
    <li><strong>BYOAI.</strong> Create proprietary LLMs trained on your own data for competitiveness and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Quell the fear.</strong> Many employees think AI is out for their jobs. But in many cases AI will be an assistant rather than a replacement. That’s why communications, management, and strategy come first – without clarity there won’t be trust. And without trust, GenAI won’t result in a sufficient return on investment (ROI).</li>

  <h2 id="trend-2-cxcs-reboot">TREND 2: CX/CS reboot</h2>
  <p><strong>Botched bots.</strong> Customer service (CS) has been cut, cut, and cut again. The big human replacement hope was bots, which are fine if you’re too lazy to read the FAQ. But the novelty of your chatbot named Brian wore off a while ago. As a result, what’s also been cut back is customer trust. Let 2024 be the year when companies refocus their customer experience (CX). As chatbots improve, humans will become a premium offering. That could mean more humans available for the higher-value work of helping special and spendy clients. (<a href="https://www.mintel.com/consumer-market-news/global-consumer-trends/">Mintel: 2024 Global Consumer Trends</a>)</p>
  <p><strong><em>Not</em> everything as a service?</strong> You get a subscription, they get a subscription, everyone gets a subscription! Why? Because there’s no other choice! Subscription fatigue is real, and growth is slowing for software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, with a 50% decrease in growth year-over-year. Lack of customization, costs, auto-renewals, belt tightening, and low ROI are all reasons why consumers and companies alike are rethinking whatever-as-a-service. There’s still something to be said for the simplicity of a one-time buy. (<a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/song/accenture-life-trends">Accenture: Life Trends 2024</a>; <a href="https://www.maxio.com/blog/maxio-institute-h1-2023-press-release">Maxio</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Inside knowledge</strong>. For those not going the human route this year, companies will roll out GenAI for personalized CS and marketing. How personalized? Companies will lean on GenAI for speed and for getting to know their customers beyond “What can I do for you today?” At the same time, marketers are reading the writing on the wall (think regulations and negative consumer sentiment) and will suddenly become big defenders of privacy.

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Give humans the luxury treatment.</strong> Bot CS will continue to grow but people respond better to other people, and that can be developed into a valuable offering. A well-trained human agent is the luxury offering of our time.</li>
    <li><strong>Audit for airware.</strong> Remember shelfware? That shrink-wrapped software you bought but your people never used? Unused cloud-based software subscriptions can be even tougher to trace. Audit your subscriptions and ax what’s costing too much and what isn’t efficient.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid the same mistakes.</strong> Only use GenAI for CS if you’ve put in place clear goals and strategies to avoid replicating all that’s wrong with the CX.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="trend-3-manufacturing">TREND 3: Manufacturing</h2>
  <p><strong>Coming soon: A factory near you.</strong> Reshoring has long been the trend that never quite happened. Well, it’s happening now. As we write, there’s a factory construction boom going on in Europe, the United States, and the not-China parts of Asia such as Japan, Korea, and India. It’s thanks in part to government investment encouraging domestic production of, among other things, semiconductors (cough, cough, China). Manufacturers are also taking the opportunity to smartify and greenify their new factories. (<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/manufacturing/manufacturing-industry-outlook.html">Deloitte: 2024 Manufacturing Industry Outlook</a>; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chipmakers-plans-factories-europe-2023-02-16/">Reuters</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Cobot anyone?</strong> Manufacturing is still suffering through a skills shortage and trying to do something about it by offering (more, better) benefits and other incentives. Most say they need significantly more people and yet are consistently losing them – that’s some problematic math there. But, hey, why worry about people when bots are inelegantly lurching to a warehouse (job) near you? Will the Digits and Optimus Gen 2s get all snuggly and work together rather than with humans? Is it still cobotting if the collaborator is also a bot?

  <p><strong>Making the industrial metaverse happen.</strong> Okay, we know. The industrial metaverse got a lot of attention at first and then … what? Not much. But apparently manufacturers have been experimenting with it in the background. And now we can add the spatial Web – aka Web 3 – to manufacturers’ goals. Web 3 is focused on interactions in digital spaces (think virtual reality) and factories are signing up for virtual interactive applications. Think of it this way: Web 3 is how manufacturers get into the industrial metaverse. Once Web 3 is further developed, the industrial metaverse can finally take off.

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Factory shopping</strong>. Is manufacturing coming to an industrial area near you? Maybe sign up for a presale to quickly reshore your own production.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t go botlistic … yet.</strong> Manufacturing’s hiring woes aren’t over quite yet, and don’t expect bots to do the heavy lifting of replacing lost workers. They are getting better, but the frenzied pace of adoption of software bots such as GenAI should not be confused with hardware bots, which are improving only incrementally.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t write off the metaverse (again).</strong> Just cause Zuck keeps whiffing on the killer app doesn’t mean you will. Mixed reality apps are quietly making a lot of progress in areas such as maintenance and research and development. Now’s the time to investigate the use of spatial technologies.</li>

  <h2 id="trend-4-supply-chains">TREND 4: Supply chains</h2>
  <p><strong>Going micro.</strong> One way of avoiding the peaks and troughs of recent supply chain upheavals is by focusing on micro-fulfillment – smaller, compact warehouses located closer to customers. Add to that smaller amounts of customized products, also produced close(-ish), and backups at the Panama Canal become a distant memory. (<a href="https://www.maersk.com/insights/digitalisation/2023/11/24/supply-chain-visibility-trends">Maersk</a>; <a href="https://qz.com/the-shift-of-manufacturing-out-of-china-is-shaking-up-s-1851064053">Quartz</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>AI meets supply chain meets regulation</strong>. GenAI is coming for the world’s supply chains. With more regulations related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) hitting in 2024, AI will be directing supply chain planning because of its ability to analyze tons of data and make predictions better than humans. That will be crucial toward finding out what’s going on in the chains at deeper levels. But it will only work for those with good data. (<a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2023/12/supply-chain-trends-2024.html">KPMG: Supply Chain Trends 2024</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Designing for disaster.</strong> Sure, you can reshore production to stave off international instability. But what about when your factory is flattened by a domestic tornado? Or ships can’t travel their usual routes? The Panama Canal and the Rhine and Mississippi rivers all had low water levels due to drought last year, and shipping felt the impacts. No wonder weather risks are top of mind for supply chain professionals. To prepare for long-term weather upheavals, designs must adapt, such as building ships that can navigate shallower waters and buildings that can stand up to 200 mph winds. (<a href="https://think.ing.com/articles/extreme-weather-makes-major-trade-routes-less-reliable">ING</a>; <a href="https://commercial.allianz.com/news-and-insights/expert-risk-articles/allianz-risk-barometer-2024-natural-catastrophes.html">Allianz</a>)</p>
  <p>INSIGHTS’S ADVICE:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use regulations to sell supply chain transparency.</strong> Supply chain pros have long struggled to prove a business case for spending money on supply chain transparency. ESG regulations will change all that and AI will help. But make sure to invest in data gathering and cleaning. It will be crucial for AI accuracy and regulatory compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Mini making.</strong> Breaking manufacturing down into smaller chunks (think modular construction) is your power hedge against supply chain problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Talk about the weather.</strong> It’s no longer just a lame conversation starter. The weather can put you out of business. Check your infrastructure and that of your supply chain partners. Is it likely to survive disasters?</li>

  <p><strong>Head in both clouds.</strong> Companies have gotten the best out of the public cloud – such as efficiency and a lesser burden on IT – and are now turning to the private cloud, with its better security and customization. They’re balancing their hybrid cloud usage so that each plays to its own strengths. Upping the strength quotient are cloud and/or hybrid industry-specific platforms that can be customized. (<a href="https://www.rackspace.com/solve/2024-it-outlook-report">Solve/Rackspace Technology: 2024 IT Outlook Report</a>; <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-16-gartner-identifies-the-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2024">Gartner: Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2024</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Smart shady.</strong> After smart glasses failing repeatedly and spectacularly (remember the unfortunate nickname for wearers of Google Glasses?), will 2024 be the year when smart glasses finally become cool rather than cringe? New more comfortable and useful versions – better functionality, less weight on the wearer’s nose, classic styling so you can make like a Beach Boy and surf (the Web) – mean that initial hesitancy (or outright derision) might be overcome and that means a big boost to the spatial Web. Privacy? Do we still care about privacy? (<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends.html">Deloitte: Tech Trends 2024</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Get your data in court.</strong> Data breaches are the target of more – and often well-publicized – lawsuits, and more courts around the world are letting those cases go ahead. Another area of litigious growth is companies taking legal action against data scrapers, copyright infringers, hackers, and the like. Add AI to the legal mix for increased volume and messiness. Expect a ballooning of legal skirmishes as laws scramble to catch up and plaintiffs find new legal avenues to pursue. (<a href="https://www.freshfields.us/insights/campaigns/data-trends-2024/">Freshfields: Data Trends 2024</a>)</p>
  <p>INSIGHTS’S ADVICE:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Going public.</strong> Investigate public and hybrid clouds for industry-specific applications that can be tailored to specific business needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Never mind the fashion.</strong> While we’re not convinced that smart glasses will be <em>the</em> fashion choice, using them for work makes sense now that they’re more comfortable and have better features</li>
    <li><strong>Look both ways.</strong> Legal beefs over data hit businesses from both sides – coming from inside and outside the house. Legal prep is the solve.</li>

  <h2 id="trend-6-hr">TREND 6: HR</h2>
  <p><strong>Where are we working again?</strong> Many employees prefer working remotely full-time or at least part of the work week. Just over half want all-the-time remote and 46% prefer a mix of both on- and off-site work. And many who were relying on promises of permanent remote work, moved to areas with lower costs of living. But what happens when employers mandate coming back to the office? Stalemate. With the skills shortage and the competition for those at the top of their game, more companies will start offering money for relocation to make working out of an office palatable again. They’ll also need to offer other sweeteners to stem the rising trend of coffee badging: showing up, getting a coffee, chatting with co-workers, then leaving to work remotely for the rest of the day.

Finance</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Virtual you.</strong> You’ve heard of digital twins. Well, here comes virtual twins. That’s when employees make digital avatars of themselves using AI trained on specific skills and industries to do work on their behalf – and maybe even earn extra money doing it. Why worry about overworking employees when they can replicate themselves many times over? On the flip side, companies could support these twins and train them on proprietary data. The big question: Who – or what – owns the rights to their/its output?

  <p><strong>The end of jobs.</strong> Who cares about jobs when what you need are skills? Technology is changing so quickly that skill obsolescence is a real concern, and that’s motivating employers and employees to focus on continual skill improvements. Makes sense that instead of hiring for specific roles, businesses will look for skills that can be applied across their companies and will offer education to make that fluidity permanent.

  </div>
  <p>By Derek Slater</p>
  <p>The factory of the future will be more:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modular, flexible, and agile</li>
    <li>Efficient and profitable</li>
    <li>Interconnected, both internally and to business partners</li>
    <li>Sustainable, for both its environment and community</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Easy to say, but ever so complicated to do?</p>
  <p>Plenty of companies struggle with the capital investments, workforce requirements, and the data-savvy to build a factory of <em>today</em>, let alone <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>
  <p>Further, to try to decipher future developments is to wade smack into a jungle of jargon and “consultantese,” from industry 4.0 and software-defined factories to analog front ends (AFEs) and 4D printing. (Yes, 4D – that’s not a typo.)<a href=""><sup>1</sup></a></p>
  <p>Nevertheless, business as usual won't cut it. Today's environment of “permacrisis,” as SAP's Richard Howells says in <a href="/resources/supply-chain-innovation-whats-next">an expert panel discussion</a> – wars, pandemic hangover, shipping backups, extreme weather events, energy costs, unstable countries – stresses traditional factories and supply chains to the breaking point. And the planetary reverberations of manufacturing, its by-products, its resources, and energy use, are existential.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, “in manufacturing, sustainability is profitability,” SAP's Mike Lackey notes in the same discussion. Increasing efficiency and agility while decreasing waste <em>will</em> feed the bottom line. In other words, building the future factory is about making goods and making money. And not just in this quarter, but for decades to come.</p>
  <p>Delving into the concrete topics underneath the pie-in-the-sky vision and through the jargon jungle, it's clear that technical progress is happening on all fronts, at a dizzying rate. Forward-looking manufacturers can take advantage of those developments now, to profit despite permacrisis challenges, while building toward tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Here are key takeaways from our special report, with links to further details in nine in-depth articles exploring the future factory. Learn how to make smart workforce and technology investments on the way there, and how to create more value beyond the factory walls in your broader supply chain.</p>

  <h2 id="the-regenerative-factory">The regenerative factory</h2>
  <p>What might a factory look like in a decade or two? Let's start by looking at <strong>how sustainability will shape tomorrow’s factories</strong>, because sustainability equals profitability, as <a href="/resources/profitable-purpose-the-future-of-business-sustainability">SAP Insights research has confirmed</a>.</p>
  <p>The lead article of our special report, “<a href="/blogs/the-sustainable-factory-of-the-future">The Sustainable Factory of the Future</a>,” sounds a perhaps counterintuitive note: the average factory footprint may be much smaller than today’s.</p>
  <p>For decades, manufacturing has focused on repeatable efficiency at an ever-greater scale. Today’s driving force, on the other hand, is increasingly a demand for more agility: for example, the ability to shift manufacturing from one place to another based on demand, capacity, or disruptive events, as well as the need to produce more customized products, rather than identical widgets. Moving to a smaller form factor also has positive implications for sustainable – or, better, regenerative – operations.</p>
  <p>“The regenerative principle is to return things better than before,” says Stanford researcher Trond Undheim. “The larger the scale, the more steel and carbon you are using, and the more difficult it becomes to disassemble. Regeneration is all about disassembly, leaving no trace, actually leaving it better.”</p>
  <p>It’s not just about disassembly; today’s ongoing operations benefit too. The use of smaller facilities requires greater efficiency, using less space and power. It also suggests multiple, dispersed production points located closer to where the manufactured goods will be used, reducing the financial and environmental costs of delivery.</p>
  <p>Whatever the size and scale, prominent manufacturers such as Interface, Siemens, and Tesla offer strategies for future factories to address all these areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Carbon:</strong> Cut emissions faster. Spot issues and prioritize improvements by using Internet of Things (IoT) data. Store (sequester) carbon in products, as well as in the factory itself (in cement and other building materials).</li>
    <li><strong>Waste:</strong> Use analytics to find advanced ways to reduce waste. Additive manufacturing yields less scrap. Reduce raw material use; recycle waste on site; think “circularly” about products through end-of-life.</li>
    <li><strong>Power:</strong> Go beyond solar with renewable sources, low-emissivity windows that reduce heating and cooling costs, green hydrogen power, and improved battery and passive energy-harvesting technology for local power storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Capture and use rainwater; detect leaks with digital twins; treat and reuse wastewater on-site; use green and blue roofs to reduce or manage runoff.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="the-smarter-factory">The smart(er) factory</h2>
  <p>Now let’s turn to the <strong>rapid advance of industrial smarts</strong>, which is happening in both the IT arena and in shop floor operating technology (OT).</p>
  <p>Tomorrow’s factory will make those of yesterday, sit in the corner with a dunce cap.</p>
  <p>A raft of technologies are already converging, including both traditional IT elements (cloud computing, edge computing, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, 5G wireless) and new OT devices and capabilities (advanced robots, cobots, autonomous transport, additive manufacturing machines, computer vision). This convergence is what many describe as “<a href="https://www.sap.cn/products/scm/industry-4-0/industry-4-0-strategy.html">industry 4.0</a>” – technologies that make possible “<a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/what-is-a-smart-factory.html">smart factories</a>” with new levels of process automation, greater efficiency and utilization, right-time right-place inventory, and increased safety.</p>
  <p>This much, you already know. And some of the near-term possibilities are easy to envision. Already in 2024, a humanoid-style robot built by Figure.ai learned, reportedly in 10 hours of training time, how to make coffee <a href="https://twitter.com/adcock_brett/status/1743987597301399852">by watching humans do it</a>, then trying, failing, and improving. The distance between that extremely expensive prototype Keurig-butler and a robotic system that learns complex assembly line tasks through computer vision isn’t far.</p>
  <p>But you also know that other, currently unforeseen smart-factory advances will lurk further over the horizon.</p>
  <p>So how to be prepared to assimilate new technology constantly, rather than seeing each wave render current machines or whole factories obsolete? That’s one motivator behind the idea of software-defined factories, where more flexible, programmable shop floor equipment can add features, change configurations, and connect to new systems with software updates rather than hardware swaps.</p>
  <p>However, as “<a href="/resources/production-logistics-and-the-new-ot">Production Logistics and the New OT</a>” find, staying on top of changes in operational advances relies on process and personnel as much as on technology: <strong>The time for meaningful IT/OT collaboration is truly overdue</strong>.</p>
  <p>When these historically siloed teams cooperate effectively, their companies can get better end-to-end visibility of manufacturing processes, machine health, efficient staffing and inventory movement, and much more while building a flexible technical architecture that more readily absorbs change and integrates whatever’s next.</p>
  <p>Companies including Pfizer, Chobani, and Kohl's show ways to cross this long-standing divide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Involve both functions earlier</strong> in each other’s projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide training and exposure</strong> for OT people in IT processes, and vice versa.</li>
    <li><strong>Set up CIOs</strong>, most often from an IT background, as leaders and learners-in-chief – actively diving into OT technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Create leadership development programs</strong> that bring IT and OT people together.</li>
    <li><strong>Address the divide head-on with humor and empathy.</strong> Try an exercise in which each side role plays the other.</li>
    <li>Consider <strong>using cybersecurity as a natural starting point</strong> for tighter IT/OT collaboration (see the next point).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="the-secure-factory">The secure factory</h2>
  <p>About <strong>that security thing, in this highly connected factory...</strong></p>
  <p>A shop full of networked, intelligent machines needs to rethink its approach to security. Ransomware attacks knocking over manufacturing operations in the past few years have made this abundantly clear. The so-called attack surface is expanding as more OT comes online and data drives more automated processes.</p>
  <p>In “<a href="/blogs/twelve-security-issues-for-evolving-factories">12 Security Issues to Address as Your Factories Evolve</a>,” our experts list key steps, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Increase visibility.</strong> “Manufacturers will need to clarify the data flows between the IT and OT networks, as well as the assets that bridge this gap – for example, addressing the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, and building automation systems.”</li>
    <li><strong>Protect power supplies and building automation systems.</strong> IT/OT security keeps adding more potential targets to defend. Local generation and storage create new challenges for safety, security, and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider mobile vulnerabilities.</strong> The fast-changing world of autonomous shop floor tools that use new communication protocols that aren't yet well tested for security.</li>
    <li><strong>Raise your threat awareness game.</strong> “Another strong pillar of defense is maintaining knowledge of the common tactics, techniques, and procedures enacted by adversaries and forming an accurate view of your organization’s posture relative to them,” says former chief information security officer Dawn Cappelli.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="converting-the-old-factory-into-a-new-factory">Converting the old factory into a new factory</h2>
  <p>Last but not least: <strong>retrofitting to bring older factories into the game</strong>.</p>
  <p>Elon Musk could scare up €5 billion to build Tesla’s “Gigafactory Berlin” from scratch, chock-full of automation and AI. Maybe your company doesn’t have that kind of money sitting around.</p>
  <p>Does that mean you stay on the sidelines? Do you need billions for a brand-new shop to even get into this smart-factory game? Do old factories <em>really</em> have to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap?</p>
  <p>Happily, they don’t. “<a href="/resources/how-industry-4-0-factories-can-still-embrace-the-past">How Industry 4.0 Factories Can Still Embrace the Past</a><u>”</u> explains why and how modernization strategies can connect older machines and buildings to modern data-driven manufacturing operations.</p>
  <p>True, it’s not as simple as slapping sensors on everything; collecting terabytes of environmental and performance data doesn’t guarantee you’ll find the right signals needed for predictive maintenance or more efficient materials movement. However, careful analysis of likely areas of improvement, the data types needed, and cost-benefit tradeoffs can lead to targeted investment and big payoff.</p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shift-by-shift, smart sensor data can provide granular insights to increase throughput.</li>
    <li>Supply chain sensor data can improve the traceability of raw material flow, indicating if a manufacturer is spending unnecessary time sourcing and procuring raw materials.</li>
    <li>Correlating real-time environmental and machine performance data may indeed reveal risks for machine and assembly line downtime.</li>
    <li>Networking and geolocation technologies can help track the movement of materials and goods, spotting inefficiencies, low inventory levels, or misplaced palettes.</li>
    <li>Combining new data sources over time can help build an increasingly valuable digital twin of an older facility and its workflows.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The experience of companies like Spirit AeroSystems and Gary Works provides modernization guidance tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ongoing employee training and assessment is vital.</li>
    <li>IT and OT teams need clear, shared goals (notice a theme here?).</li>
    <li>Top executives have to lead the change management charge.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="the-future-manufacturing-workforce">The future manufacturing workforce</h2>
  <p>New factories require new skills. In “<a href="/resources/advanced-manufacturing-skills-workers-will-need">Advanced Manufacturing Skills Workers Will Need,”</a> experts foresee how common roles will change. For instance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Production planners</strong> will use predictive analytics to anticipate machine downtime or late-arriving materials; work out solutions, such as predictive machine maintenance or purchasing more materials in advance; and look for continuous improvement ideas to reduce waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Line leaders</strong> will spend less time creating reports and more time coaching and problem solving with their team members.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine operators</strong> will probably have more general training, oversee more machines at once, and work with AI tools for problem solving and light maintenance. They may rely on voice and gestural commands to operate the equipment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These changes put a premium on flexibility, continuous learning, and problem-solving skills for all manufacturing employees.</p>
  <p>Finding or creating the workforce for these challenges will involve a mix of strategies, as noted in “<a href="/resources/hunting-for-advanced-manufacturing-talent-four-moves">Four Steps for Hunting for Advanced Manufacturing Talent,”</a> including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rewriting job descriptions.</strong> You may find help with this from industry associations or other groups. Research Institute AIM Photonics worked with MIT to develop advanced job descriptions specific to the photonics industry.</li>
    <li><strong>Reskilling current employees.</strong> Bosch plans to spend €1 billion over five years to reskill employees in advanced tech areas ranging from AI to electric vehicle engineering, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reskilling-employees-is-a-priority-for-companies-like-bosch-2022-3"><em>Business Insider</em> reports</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Partnering with local educational institutions to expand the talent pool.</strong> In southern China, Guizhou Equipment Manufacturing Vocational College has created new courses covering digital process design, advanced machine tools, and debugging industrial robots. It provides specific retraining for workers in all career stages, including laid off and unemployed persons, as detailed in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/upskilling-employees">an Autodesk article</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refurbishing your workforce and investing in local education is also part of how the future factory provides regenerative benefits to its local community.</p>

  <h2 id="beyond-the-factory--the-future-supply-chain">Beyond the factory – the future supply chain</h2>
  <p>Inevitably, the future factory will connect more directly to more partners – that's the only way to work toward real-time, decision-making, based on demand.</p>
  <p>Your <strong>contract manufacturers (CMs)</strong> may be your closest partners. Yet typically this is an area of limited (i.e., almost zero) visibility in manufacturers’ supply chains. “<a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/contract-manufacturing-supply-chains-blind-spot.html">Contract Manufacturing: Supply Chains’ Blind Spot</a><u>”</u> explains why: it's not fundamentally a tech issue, it's a problem of trust, trust, trust!</p>
  <p>Germany's LkSG law (also known as the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act) demands more visibility into a manufacturer’s supply chain – both EU- and worldwide – to help weed out labor abuse and similar problems. But whether you're solving for compliance or something else, every disruption or change can present a chance to improve supply chain performance too. Example: during the pandemic, Haier Group, based in China, mobilized its supply chain, including CMs, to share information through a homegrown cloud application. Its CM partners reported results, including a reduction in cycle time, reduced procurement costs, and increased customer orders.</p>
  <p>How to improve visibility and collaboration with CMs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Communicate to partners that regulatory requirements are an opportunity</strong> to improve processes and profits for both OEMs and CMs.</li>
    <li><strong>You go first</strong> in sharing systems and data with your contract manufacturing partners. Show trust to earn trust and provide value to gain value.</li>
    <li><strong>Rework contracts</strong> to formally spell out how the parties will work together in a mutually beneficial way, as opposed to just defining a transactional model. For example, a <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article details a method of contracting that uses a “<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/11/3-ways-to-build-trust-with-your-suppliers">vested sourcing model</a>.”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With trust improving, improved <strong>supply chain technology</strong> should surely yield better performance – right? But somehow, often, it doesn’t.</p>
  <p>In “<a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/supply-chain-innovation-whats-next.html">Supply Chain Innovation: What’s Next?</a><u>,”</u> three experts explore why roughly eight out of 10 supply chain tech projects fail, and how to flip that ratio.</p>
  <p>Their recommendations include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Innovation benefits from <strong>a digital officer</strong> who can “paint a picture of the possible” to secure investment in pilot projects.</li>
    <li>However, they then have to let go of successful pilots and <strong>hand ownership over to the business.</strong></li>
    <li>Innovators and project leads should <strong>“show return over and over.”</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Get your innovation funding model right.</strong> Pilots are often funded from centralized technology budgets, but then quickly the model should shift to the infrastructure budget plus co-funding from business lines and factories.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared goals</strong> help get the plants to invest.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="beyond-the-factory--understand-the-value-you-create">Beyond the factory – understand the value you create</h2>
  <p>As we said at the outset – there’s a lot of detail to consider and work through. Here’s a parting idea to help clear the mind and prioritize decisions: <strong>start by reexamining how your company creates value</strong>.</p>
  <p>A factory is one link in a chain, and (ostensibly) the whole chain is designed to deliver something of great value to a customer who really needs it. Consultant Simon Wardley argues that a better understanding of how value is created in, and by, the product should yield smarter business decisions, resulting in better factory design and use.</p>
  <p>Seems obvious? Wardley contends most companies fail at this fundamental level: “My experience has been that organizations are not very strong at understanding users, they’re much poorer at understanding users’ needs, and they can be quite poor at understanding the chain of components required to meet those needs.”</p>
  <p>· He says lack of visibility beyond the next step in the value chain is one culprit.</p>
  <p>· Failure to map your competitive space is another – accounting for change over time, such as a gradual commodification of components.</p>
  <p>Test your future-factory assumptions with Wardley's insights in “<a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/landscape-view-into-value-chain-relationships.html">A Landscape View into Value Chain Relationships</a>.” You’ll gain a fresh outlook on familiar terrain.</p>

  <p>Biometrics that ethically and transparently collect and use health data are one path to quelling infection spreads.</p>
  <p>With the likelihood of more pandemics and rolling physical distancing measures, we need solutions that work in real time and across environments to monitor public health and provide crucial information to healthcare professionals, policy makers, and the public. Innovative uses of biometrics could help us control outbreaks with minimal disruptions to our lives.</p>

  <p>Wearables and ambient biometric sensors that monitor large public spaces offer a minimally intrusive way to collect personal health data in real time. Some could also help with contact tracing, prompt users to seek medical attention faster, and encourage people to make sound decisions about social distancing. Researchers are developing:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Rings that collect symptom data, which is then run through an algorithm that assesses the likelihood of infection</li>
    <li>Adhesive patches that use health indicators like sweat, coughing, temperature, and heart rate, which are uploaded to the cloud and used to monitor infection transmission</li>
    <li>Apps that match health indicators from a short recording of the user’s voice against a database of infected patients’ voices</li>
    <li>Thermometers for mass temperature scanning in public spaces and for large gatherings</li>
    <li>Adaptive and responsive spaces that can be quickly modified in health emergencies, like setting up temporary treatment centers</li>
    <li>Smart flooring that creates safe pathways and smart elevators that manage rider numbers</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="privacy-and-trust-first">Privacy and trust first</h2>
  <p>We could be entering a period of world-changing research and collaboration across health, design, and public policy. Biometrics can be key to creating new ways to safely interact with our environments and each other.</p>
  <p>But biometrics will only be accepted if our personal data is truly private and we trust how it is used. It’s likely that the increased application of biometrics will prompt concerns about anonymization and personal data collection.</p>
  <p>For biometrics to be effective, there need to be guidelines and regulations in place, including:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All biometric applications must be based on scientifically sound research.</li>
    <li>Permissions for personal data collection and use must be obtained from individuals.</li>
    <li>There must be limits on and transparency into who has access to personal data, where it will be housed and for how long, and what it will be used for</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="safer-spaces">Safer spaces</h2>
  <p>Architects and interior designers are exploring how design and technology can be used in concert to limit the spread of infections without sacrificing style or quality of life. Embedding biometrics could guide usage patterns, provide health alerts, monitor air quality and virus transmission, and ultimately inform safer building design.</p>

        <p>What if sustainability didn’t require special effort? Get ready to roll up your sleeves because we gathered some ways to make green part of your day-to-day operations.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Sustainability stops becoming an extra effort, an add-on, when you design it into your business processes. And sustainability doesn’t always have to be the only goal in mind – sometimes you can create sustainable processes just by doing them better. Three overall trends define the future of sustainable operations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Digital doppelgängers to the rescue.</strong> Data is the invisible partner that every physical process needs. It improves performance through better analysis, of course, but it also doesn’t cost much or take up much room. That makes it greener, too.</li>
    <li><strong>The exponential bandwagon gets some new players.</strong> Moore’s Law isn’t just for PCs anymore. There are other technologies surfing Gordo’s wave of exponential increases in performance and decreases in cost that boost operations and greenness.</li>
    <li><strong>There’s a new way to make stuff in town.</strong> The essential components in the manufacturing process are getting a makeover. The bill of materials is expanding to improve performance and sustainability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can learn more about how to make operations better (and greener) in the SAP Insights articles linked below.</p>

  <p><strong>Charge it, then recharge it.</strong> Renewable energy is becoming competitive. To make it transformative, we also need to reinvent a technology that most of us take for granted: the battery. Scientists, industry players, and venture capitalists are approaching battery power with solutions ranging from carbon nanotubes to electric charges harnessed from compost piles. Still, many challenges remain in the quest to produce the cheap, renewable, zero-carbon batteries that the world craves.</p>

  <p><strong>Advanced technologies are giving fashion a new look.</strong> The fashion industry has a sustainability problem. It’s on pace to generate 17.5 kilograms of waste for every citizen on Earth by 2030. Technology advances in everything, including sensors and fabrics, give the industry an opportunity to make a two-step change: less waste and more function. Among the innovations are clothes that will help us improve our performance and prevent injury on the job and those that change their appearance and function according to our requirements and desires.</p>

  <p><strong>Table stakes.</strong> None of the world’s challenges exist in isolation, but the need to put food on the table – indeed, to feed the hungry – is unique in its impact on the entire global economy. By applying technology innovations, we could shrink the environmental burden of farming, improve crop diversity so that diets are more nutritious and agriculture is more sustainable, help farmers produce more food while increasing their profits, and make food distribution safer and more efficient. If you consider that the globe’s population continues to rise, it’s a big deal.</p>

  <p><strong>Calling out carbon.</strong> Researchers are finding intriguing ways to address elements of the climate crisis caused by carbon emissions – and providing signals of where future solutions may lie. Think: Fabric that collects solar energy so that your shirt can charge your phone. Generators that turn one drop of rainwater into energy that lights up 100 small LED bulbs. Electricity generated by the friction of elevator brakes. Using AI to spot model supply chains and find ways to cut carbon emissions.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>On New Year’s Eve last year, no one was particularly sad to see the end of 2020. It may be destined to become like 1776 or 1929: one of those dates that kids learn about in school as marking a turbulent event in human history. And while it has certainly been a challenging time in both 2020 and 2021, it has also presented opportunities for learning, change, and growth. This 2021 year in review highlights examples of business sectors and models that have fundamentally transformed in the past year – both culturally and digitally – and the benefits these transformations are delivering.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="digital-transformation-took-center-stage">2021: Digital transformation took center stage</h2>
  <p>A year ago, it seemed that if there was anything to learn from 2020, it would come in the form of a cautionary tale. In the midst of a pandemic and political upheavals, it didn’t seem there was much to be optimistic about. But today, as we make our way through the final moments of 2021, a story is beginning to emerge. It has a phoenix theme – of worn-out things crumbling away to make way for rejuvenation. And it’s a bit of a cliff-hanger as well because in the opening act, two of the most important characters (technology and medicine) were asked to perform daring feats they’ve never done before.</p>
  <p>As people continue with vaccines and booster shots, we know that medicine has done its part. But technology performed as well. <a href="/resources/what-is-digital-transformation">Digital transformation</a> was a major focus for businesses as legacy processes and old-school systems could not meet the urgent demands of employees and customers. Out of necessity, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>-driven smart systems were quickly implemented to help us work, communicate, shop, and become more resilient in a locked-down world. At the end of 2021, these new technologies and tools continue to mature and digital transformation is helping to create a future where people are shaping the world to fit their needs and preferences, rather than the other way around.</p>
  <h2 id="hybrid-workplace-models-come-into-their-own">Hybrid workplace models come into their own</h2>
  <p>When almost overnight the bulk of the nation’s workforce didn’t go into the office, nobody quite knew what to expect. One thing was clear in 2020 – <a href="/blogs/hr-tech-trends">HR tech trends</a> were accelerated by about five years in just a few months. And then in 2021, the statistics started rolling in and we learned that remote workers are at least as – if not <em>more</em> – productive than they are in the office. In fact, a <a href="https://www.greatplacetowork.com/resources/blog/remote-work-productivity-study-finds-surprising-reality-2-year-study">two-year study</a> of over 800,000 employees at Fortune 500 companies determined that employee productivity was the same or better during the height of lockdown than it was in the same period in 2019.</p>

  </p>
  <p>As the year progressed and workforce technologies got better, faster, and more powerful, we began to realize that remote and on-premise were not necessarily either/or options. In 2021, we saw a meteoric rise in the “<a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/what-is-a-hybrid-workplace-model.html">hybrid workplace</a>” concept – where businesses could retain the culture, stability, and social interaction of a physical office while giving their employees the flexibility to choose remote work for some or much of the time.</p>
  <p>The smart, <a href="/resources/ai-for-hr">AI-powered HR technology</a> that first helped to manage a suddenly remote workforce, has matured in 2021 and now empowers employers and employees alike to customize goals, roles, and structures. These increasingly powerful technologies mean that hybrid teams can be driven by shared, measurable priorities rather than hands on a clock. Night owls can do their thing at midnight; early birds can get cracking at dawn – all connected to live, interactive systems that never sleep or need a break.</p>

  <h2 id="resilience-born-of-disruption-supply-chain-issues-in-2021">Resilience born of disruption: Supply chain issues in 2021</h2>
  <p>For several years, trade unrest and shifting consumer expectations had been straining supply chain operations to an uncomfortable degree. For many businesses, their global supply chains were being held together with legacy systems and outdated processes. But it took the shock of the pandemic to highlight the full extent of <a href="/resources/supply-chain-digital-transformation-cloud">supply chain issues</a> and vulnerability and to really catalyze modernization and digitalization in this sector. As we reach the end of 2021, we are beginning to see a much more strategic (and less reactive) application of the AI-powered technologies needed to run complex and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/integrated-business-planning/what-is-a-resilient-supply-chain.html">resilient supply chains</a>.</p>
  <p>In addition, the Amazon Effect isn’t showing any signs of waning, with over 90% of consumers now seeing five-day <a href="https://xdelivery.ai/2022-shipping-report/">delivery windows</a> as the absolute baseline and 62% expecting three-day delivery. These trends are particularly taxing on the <a href="/resources/last-mile-logistics">last mile delivery</a> links in supply chains, where large shipments and inventories atomize into millions of single orders, all with unique destinations and schedules. Fomented by lockdown, 2021 saw the expansion of armies of e-bike and personal car owners transformed into powerful on-demand, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/supply-chain-logistics.html">last mile delivery networks</a> – managed by user-friendly apps and smart, cloud-connected supply chain technologies.</p>
  <h2 id="shared-mobility-and-changing-attitudes-about-transportation">Shared mobility and changing attitudes about transportation</h2>
  <p>For the auto industry, 2021 was marked by shortages and backlogs that carried over from 2020 and affected manufacturers of both gasoline-powered and electric vehicles. The recent rise in remote and gig work also reduced car usage (and reliance). Furthermore, <a href="https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/76668">millennials are buying fewer cars</a> than the generation before them. No single one of these factors on its own led to a significant change in vehicle ownership preferences in 2021. But when you add them all together and throw in a handful of anxiety over climate change, you see a new consumer culture beginning to emerge around cars and how we use, share, and own them.</p>
  <p>And while North Americans still have an overall preference for private vehicle ownership, we’re seeing phenomenal growth in urban <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020bikesharesnapshot.pdf">micro-mobility usage</a> (e-scooter and e-bike sharing networks) with a strong and steady trend toward simpler and more accessible <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/carsharing-market">car-sharing</a> solutions and apps.</p>
  <h2 id="omnichannel-retail-everything-anywhere-all-the-time">Omnichannel retail: Everything, anywhere, all the time</h2>
  <p>A lot of retail sector data has been gathered in the past 18 months and it’s clear that <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/quarterly-online-sales/">online shopping</a> levels will not go back down to where they were before the pandemic. But it’s not really the volume of e-commerce that is the story for 2021 – it’s the shopping experience as a whole. In 2020, for your store to survive, it had to offer smooth online ordering and fast, flexible fulfillment and delivery options. If these choices weren’t available, you simply didn’t have any customers.</p>
  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>More than one-third of Americans have made omnichannel features such as buying online for in-store pickup part of their regular shopping routine since the pandemic, and nearly two-thirds of those individuals plan to continue.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-survival-guide-to-omnichannel-and-the-path-to-value">McKinsey</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In 2021, as consumers return to brick-and-mortar shops, they still want all the micro-fulfillment choices that they get online – only they want them to seamlessly integrate with their in-store experiences as well. For example, if a shopper tries on an item in the store, they want to be able to scan it and add it to an online cart, so they can look at it later. Finally, if they end up returning that item, they don’t want to drive all the way back to the store – they want to choose to have it picked up or to drop it off at a choice of logistics providers within blocks of their home.</p>
  <p>Shoppers have wanted this degree of flexibility for a long time. But once again, it was the pandemic that helped to accelerate many of the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/commerce-cloud.html">e-commerce technologies</a> driving the complex omnichannel demands we’ve seen emerge in 2021.</p>

  <h2 id="using-data-and-technology-for-sustainability-goal-setting">Using data and technology for sustainability goal setting</h2>
  <p>If the pandemic hadn’t served as a strong enough reminder of the volatility of the natural world, that point got driven home in 2021 by a devastating series of global climate and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/1/recapping-the-most-major-weather-events-of-2021">weather events</a>. China dealt with some of the most severe sandstorms in history. Californians battled through the worst fire season on record. Southern Europe endured snowstorms and brutal wildfires. British Columbians in Canada were beleaguered by unprecedented heat, fires, and flooding. The summit of Greenland even saw rain (instead of snow) fall for the first time in history.</p>
  <p>With a new political administration in the U.S. and growing <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2021/10/sustainable-transport-conference-calls-for-vastly-accelerated-action-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-and-build-a-green-inclusive-and-equitable-future/">commitment to decarbonization</a>, 2021 was a year of “walking the walk.” A reduced tolerance for platitudes and greenwashing has meant that companies have had to demonstrate real and measurable results from their sustainability efforts. This past year, it grew ever clearer that smart, cloud-based solutions would deliver the analytics and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability.html">sustainability insights</a> to set and achieve more robust decarbonization goals while remaining competitive and profitable.</p>
  <h2 id="rising-from-the-ashes-with-smarter-and-more-resilient-business-technologies">Rising from the ashes with smarter and more resilient business technologies</h2>
  <p>It’s impossible to mention all the industries and sectors where business models and technologies have evolved irrevocably in 2021. If so, you’d be reading 2021 year in review until the final strains of Auld Lang Syne. In the end, it goes back to the phoenix and how it’s such an apt old-fashioned metaphor for a modern technological phenomenon: <em>Disruption leads to innovation and digital transformation</em>.</p>

  <p>However, the way we currently produce and use materials is so wasteful and toxic that we’re degrading the planet beyond its ability to repair itself, with all that implies for humanity’s survival. In 2023, “Earth Overshoot Day,” the day on which humans use more natural resources than the planet can regenerate in a year, arrived on August 2. In other words, humanity now needs <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/how-many-earths-or-countries-do-we-need/">1.7 Earths</a> just to satisfy its demands.</p>
  <p>This situation is not just unsustainable; it’s permanently altering our environment. The weight of every human-made thing that exists, from the biggest ocean vessels to the smallest electronic components, now equals all living <a href="https://singularityhub.com/2020/12/24/anthropocene-human-made-materials-now-weigh-as-much-as-all-living-biomass-say-scientists/">biomass</a> combined. If current trends continue, this “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3010-5">anthropogenic mass</a>” will outweigh the natural world threefold by 2040. And the output of all this human activity has a negative environmental impact disproportionate to its size: we produce more than <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chempr.2020.12.006">350 million metric tons</a> of synthetic polymers (plastics) each year, but 76% of all plastic ever <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-817880-5.00002-5">produced</a> is lying unused in landfills, floating in the oceans, and defiling the natural environment.</p>
  <p>But there’s hope for a more sustainable future. Researchers and innovative companies are rethinking the materials that businesses use throughout their operations. They understand that we can no longer separate how materials are used from how they’re sourced and disposed of – so they’re creating better alternatives for existing needs, designing materials to do more than is currently possible, and inventing materials that are less harmful to the planet and even actively help <em>regenerate</em> natural ecosystems.</p>

  <h2 id="finding-alternatives-for-plastics-and-textiles--and-harvesting-carbon-emissions-for-new-uses">Finding alternatives for plastics and textiles – and harvesting carbon emissions for new uses</h2>
  <p>To remove conventional materials from supply chains, we need to find sustainable alternatives that perform at least as well, if not better. After all, so much plastic exists because it is lightweight, durable, relatively low-cost, and can be used in a multitude of ways.</p>
  <p>In fact, the <strong>plastics</strong> problem is a leading target for improving materials use. Many possibilities are emerging for developing durable but biodegradable bioplastics. One approach involves diverting food waste, with promising experiments involving <a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/creating-high-performance-plastic-foam-from-whey-protein/12521/">whey protein</a>, <a href="http://innovationnewsnetwork.com/citrus-peel-pef-plastics/10743/">citrus peels</a>, <a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/enhancing-food-preservation-mango-based-bioplastic/13572/">mango leaves</a>, <a href="https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/26-october-1-november-2020/bioplastic-made-from-lobster-shells-leads-wave-of-material-innovation/">lobster shells</a>, <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/making-cleaner-greener-biodegradable-plastics-from-waste-fish-parts/">fish oil</a> from salmon processing scraps, and <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/plant-based-vegan-spider-silk-provides-sustainable-alternative-to-single-use-plastics/">soybean oil</a> byproducts. Other sources of biopolymers come from beyond the plate and pantry, like <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/sustainable-future-scientists-rethink-plastics-and-devices">cellulose</a>, which makes up the cell walls of plants, and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/mycelium-fungi-green-materials-1.5954664">mycelium</a>, the root network of fungi. There’s even a company that crushes stone to extract <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90600241/manufacturing-most-innovative-companies-2021">calcium carbonate</a>, one of the most common minerals in the world, and uses it to replace up to 80% of the plastic in chip bags, candy wrappers, and other packaging so it degrades in months instead of centuries.</p>
  <p>Another material that needs to be made more sustainably is <strong>concrete</strong>. Traditionally, concrete is made by binding gravel and fine sand with a paste of cement (made of limestone and ash that have been burned together and ground up) and water. Its strength and durability make concrete the most widely used human-made material on the planet, but <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/1/204">making it</a> consumes about 10% of the water used worldwide for industrial and commercial activities and emits about 8% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. But researchers have discovered that replacing up to half of the sand, which is expensive and carbon-intensive to produce, with waste clay dug up during <a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/producing-sustainable-concrete-repurposing-excavation-waste/10977/">excavation work</a>, makes a super-concrete that’s both stronger and diverts construction material from landfills. Another new approach to concrete involves combining lime binder with fast-growing hemp plants to create a renewable, carbon-sequestering “<a href="https://sustainablebrands.com/read/product-service-design-innovation/3-advances-in-sequestering-carbon-in-the-built-environment">hempcrete</a>” that weighs eight times less than standard concrete and is ideal for non-structural uses like borders or sidewalks.</p>

  <p>There’s ample room to rethink <strong>other construction materials</strong>, too, as well as how to use them to design buildings with smaller ecological footprints. Renewable bio-based alternatives to standard building materials might include nanocellulose <a href="https://revolutionized.com/7-amazing-ways-we-use-nanocellulose/">insulation</a> that’s stronger and more effective than Styrofoam, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210504154557.htm">transparent, heat-retaining wood</a> made with citrus peel waste, and <a href="https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/top-10-construction-industry-trends-innovations-in-2021/">engineered wood products</a> that are as strong, stable, safe, and as versatile as concrete and steel. There’s also lightweight, flexible, emissions-free construction board made from cellulose extracted from <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2020/11/26/honext-recyclable-construction-material-cellulose-paper/">paper recycling waste</a> that would otherwise be discarded, and <a href="https://www.buildwithrise.com/stories/hempwood-the-sustainable-new-building-material">wood made from hemp</a> that’s been bioengineered to be as durable as oak, but to grow 100 times faster. And nanotechnology has enabled <a href="https://www.graphenglass.com/">graphene-based</a> construction materials that enhance solar protection, deflect wind, kill germs, and more, actively improving the buildings’ immediate environments.</p>
  <p>In addition to shelter, we need clothing, furniture, and bedding. But <strong>textiles and fabrics</strong> are often unsustainable. If the fashion industry continues its current practices, it will create an <a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/can-the-fashion-industry-ever-really-be-sustainable">estimated</a> 148 million tons of waste by 2030, or 38.5 pounds (17.5 kilograms) of waste for every person on the planet. We’ll need eco-friendly alternatives that create less waste during production, like fast-growing <a href="https://sourcingjournal.com/denim/denim-mills/us-national-hemp-association-fiber-kontoor-panda-biotech-agi-xinjiang-cotton-276485/">hemp</a> as a cotton substitute or artificial leather made of <a href="https://utenvironment.org/2020/11/05/mycelium-the-future-of-leather/">mycelium</a> fibers.</p>
  <p><strong>Other industries</strong> are also rethinking materials use. Take <strong>aerospace</strong>, for example. Researchers recently announced they had developed a new <a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/optimising-future-aircraft-with-the-worlds-lightest-aerogel-material/12625/">aerogel</a> that, while not made from particularly green materials itself, is so lightweight that it would significantly cut fuel consumption in the next generation of aircraft – while also reducing noise pollution from the engine, both inside and outside the cabin. Another recent development in <strong>construction</strong> involves ultra-white <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q2/the-whitest-paint-is-here-and-its-the-coolest.-literally..html">paint</a> so effective at reflecting sunlight and infrared heat that it actually makes surfaces cooler than their surroundings. The scientists who developed it speculate that giving buildings a lightweight, hyper-white coat of paint could be enough to significantly reduce the need for electricity-hungry air conditioning.</p>
  <p>We’ll also turn more <strong>waste</strong> into value by capturing carbon belched from smokestacks. By turning it into black <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/air-ink/">inks</a>, paints, and coatings, or embedding it in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/magazine/interface-carpet-carbon.html">carpet tiles</a> that also use recycled vinyl, waste vegetation, and salvaged nylon, we can create durable products that move greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere for years, if not decades.</p>
  <p>Finding more sustainable materials for our present-day needs is just the beginning. Materials scientists are going further by creating and using materials that expand on what’s possible.</p>
  <h2 id="materials-with-future-potential">Materials with future potential</h2>
  <p>As we investigate the properties of more renewable materials, we will find uses for them that aren’t possible with materials we’re familiar with today.</p>
  <p>For example, when certain common ocean bacteria eat a combination of gelatin and sand, they turn into a mass of <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/this-regenerative-building-material-is-made-from-sand-and-bacteria">living concrete</a> that can repair and reproduce itself. This material has promise for rebuilding after disasters and providing shelter quickly in challenging conditions. Scientists think they could even teach it to make oxygen and water, which would be useful in harsh environments – not just on Earth, but on other planets, should NASA realize plans to send crews to settle Mars, for example. Similarly, researchers are working on making building materials and tools by combining chitin, a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14610026/">biopolymer</a> produced by fungi and insects, with <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/martian-buildings-could-be-made-of-chitin-based-material/">other materials</a> that are readily available.</p>
  <p>Plants will also inspire new material properties. A lightweight, breathable textile made of cellulose fibers and <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/seacell-fiber/">seaweed</a> could be able to infuse nutrients through skin contact, for clothing that nourishes the person wearing it. A genetically tailored <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/kombucha-tea-inspires-new-living-material-for-biosensing-applications/">kombucha tea</a> starter that can sense pollutants and produce glow-in-the-dark enzymes could potentially be an eco-friendly biosensor indicating a package has been tampered with. Plants infused with nanoparticles that <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/ambient-plant-illumination-could-light-way-greener-buildings-0510">turn energy from photosynthesis</a> into light could replace lighting fixtures with ambient off-grid lighting that also freshens the air.</p>
  <p>In addition, researchers are creating partly organic and non-organic <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/animate-materials/animate-materials-report.pdf">animate materials</a> that are capable of sensing and adapting to their environments. Buildings made from these materials would be able to harvest light, water, heat, bacteria, greenhouse gases, and biowaste from their surroundings and inhabitants, then use those resources to maintain and repair themselves while generating useful outputs like power, oxygen, heat, and drinkable water. Equipment in industrial facilities could be made from self-repairing plastics and self-diagnostic coatings that simplify maintenance. Products could be programmed to disassemble themselves at end-of-life so their basic components can be recycled or repurposed. Even <a href="/blogs/fashion-the-future-interface-between-mind-body-and-planet">clothing</a> could be made with animate materials that respond to people’s vital signs to keep them comfortable or detect possible illness.</p>

  <h2 id="regeneration-the-next-frontier">Regeneration: The next frontier</h2>
  <p>In the search for a sustainable materials future, the ultimate outcome could be a broad shift to materials that aren’t just lower-impact, but that actively regenerate the environment and systems they are part of. That could mean designing materials that sustain themselves, restore nutrients to the environment as they break down, or actively remove <em>existing</em> waste from the environment as they’re created. Researchers in the Netherlands recently mixed microalgae with bacterial cellulose to create a “<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tnw/researchers-create-living-material-based-on-algae">living material</a>” that can be 3D printed into sturdy, biodegradable objects that sustain and regenerate themselves through photosynthesis. One potential application is artificial leaves that, given water and CO<sub>2</sub>, emit oxygen and store energy as sugars that can be harvested for fuel.</p>
  <p>Living materials like this could also be formed into artificial skin that speeds healing by flooding a wound site with oxygen before dissolving – or <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tnw/researchers-create-living-material-based-on-algae">fabric</a> that requires less water than cotton to produce, purifies the air through photosynthesis, and returns nutrients to the environment when it biodegrades.</p>
  <p>People who prefer less literal active wear may choose instead to wear textiles made from repurposed agricultural waste, and that break down at end of life to return nutrients to the environment. According to the EU’s Reflow Project, these garments could come from <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/pinatex/">pineapple leaves</a>, <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/malai-plant-base-leather/">coconut water</a>, or crustacean shells combined with <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/orange-fibre/">citrus byproducts</a> or <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/best-practices/tomtex/">coffee grounds</a>.</p>
  <p>When it comes time to package all of these products, we can feed sewage <a href="https://www.futurity.org/bioplastics-mangrove-bacteria-wastewater-2487542-2/?utm_source=rss&#x26;utm_medium=rss&#x26;utm_campaign=bioplastics-mangrove-bacteria-wastewater-2487542-2">sludge</a> and agriculture wastewater to hungry bacteria who excrete it as biopolymers that can be made into biodegradable plastics. Sourcing plastics this way could remove a sizable amount of sewage sludge from landfills – 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools’ worth is produced annually in the United States alone – and when those bioplastics dissolve or are recycled into their individual components, we can reuse, recycle, and reform those components into more sustainable materials.</p>
  <p>The future of materials isn’t just about making man-made items more durable or designing them so that they can be upcycled or retired with less harm to the environment. It’s a fundamentally different paradigm. Ultimately, the future of materials requires us to leave behind our unsustainable system of resource extraction, processing, consumption, and disposal in favor of one where our materials restore and/or repair the damage we have done to the planet.</p>
  <p>In other words, it’s not enough to travel down the wrong path more slowly. We need to take a different path – one that actually improves the quality of life for humanity and all other living things.</p>

    <div>
      <div>When a company has a truly diverse workforce and an inclusive culture, employees feel comfortable bringing their whole selves – their unique ideas, perspectives, and experiences – to work. This translates into big benefits for employers as statistics and studies show that diverse companies are more profitable than their less diverse counterparts.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Organizations are taking note and continuing to prioritize diversity. But while gains are being made, there’s still a long way to go.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-workplace-diversity">What is workplace diversity?</h2>
  <p>A <a href="/resources/diversity-in-the-workplace">diverse workplace</a> mirrors society in that it includes people of different races, genders, ages, sexual orientations, religions, and those with a range of backgrounds, experiences, education, and beliefs. Hiring a diverse mix of people is the first step to achieving workplace diversity but eliminating institutional bias so that employees feel a sense of belonging and inclusion makes a diverse workforce powerful.</p>
  <p>Workplace diversity and inclusion is critical because it is demonstrably better for business. A diverse mix of people leads to a diversity of thinking, which in turn leads to increased creativity and innovation. Inclusive companies are “1.7 times more likely to be innovative,” according to <a href="https://joshbersin.com/2015/12/why-diversity-and-inclusion-will-be-a-top-priority-for-2016/">Josh Bersin</a>, his research also shows that they get “2.3 times more cash flow per employee.”</p>
  <h2 id="diversity-in-the-workplace-examples-whos-included">Diversity in the workplace examples: Who’s included?</h2>
  <p>The goal of diversity in the workplace is better business outcomes, including increased innovation, revenue, employee engagement, and retention. This is predicated on providing equitable pay and representation for the entire workforce – no matter their gender, ethnicity, or religion – from the mailroom to the boardroom. When everyone feels included, has their opinions sought and valued, and has the opportunity to fulfill their professional potential, both companies and employees benefit.</p>
  <p>Examples of different areas of diversity to focus on in the workplace include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gender diversity:</strong> To achieve gender diversity, a company needs to work towards a representation of the people of the community in which it operates – including transgender and nonbinary individuals – across the whole company. Despite companies being firmly committed to gender diversity, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/14/gender-discrimination-comes-in-many-forms-for-todays-working-women/">42% of women</a> report having faced gender discrimination at work and <a href="https://americanprogress.org/article/discrimination-experiences-among-lgbtq-people-us-2020-survey-results/">83% of transgender individuals</a> report that discrimination has negatively affected their ability to be hired.</li>
    <li><strong>Racial and ethnic diversity:</strong> Racial diversity focuses on hiring people of different races and ethnicities at all levels. In the U.S., racial discrimination may have been illegal since the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but it’s still an active issue in the American workplace. Only <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/only-4-black-fortune-500-200024302.html?guccounter=1&#x26;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9ldWMtd29yZC1lZGl0Lm9mZmljZWFwcHMubGl2ZS5jb20v&#x26;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADGGzsa3mfbBijHC2dgtr6fML5-38KX-yLtzyTOHhkIAuuX90EN__CSVfxFpw9Lq9f63rvANibhmCoBVOENhE35LNySkoOcM9jkhIYSqS_F-ebr0WT4xn4LHE5TwSi5duJ8Lnycdw7AxV87dP6aeKGkiJliYKJQI3YRr2s9hCjtE">four Fortune 500 companies</a> have a Black CEO, for example.</li>
    <li><strong>LGBTQ+ diversity:</strong> The LGBTQ+ workforce includes a range of generations and a spectrum of sexual orientations. While “5.1% of U.S. women identify as LGBTQ+ as do 3.9% of U.S. men,” according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/how-the-lgbtq-plus-community-fares-in-the-workplace">McKinsey</a>, they are underrepresented in the workforce and they can find it more challenging to bring their whole selves to work where they often face microaggressions and discrimination.</li>

    <li><strong>Generational and age diversity:</strong> For potentially the first time ever, there are five generations in the workforce – Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Baby Boomers, and Traditionalists. While all generations can experience ageism, <a href="https://unece.org/population/news/combating-ageism-workplace-key-sustainable-future-work">data shows</a> that people “over 55 are more likely to feel discriminated against on the basis of their age than those below 30.”</li>
    <li><strong>Religious and spiritual diversity:</strong> An increasingly global economy means that employers need to consider how they can accommodate and respect a wide range of religions and beliefs in the workplace. Offering holidays based on different religious or cultural affiliations is just one way organizations are addressing religious diversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Disability diversity:</strong> While one in four adults in the U.S. has a disability – whether visible or invisible – only about <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/disabl.pdf">18% of working-age</a> Americans with disabilities are part of the workforce. Making the workforce accessible to those with disabilities so they can fully participate without barriers is key to achieving disability diversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Socioeconomic diversity:</strong> While the prevailing myth is that anyone, regardless of their beginnings, can rise to great heights, the truth is that one’s background continues to determine their access to education and job opportunities. <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/01/the-forgotten-dimension-of-diversity">Statistics show</a> that “U.S. workers from lower social-class origins are 32% less likely to become managers than are people from higher origins.”</li>

  <h2 id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei-a-definition">Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI): A definition</h2>
  <p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) go hand in hand. When you have diversity without inclusion, you may have a representative workforce, but you aren’t taking advantage of employees’ diverse perspectives and different approaches. And when you have diversity and equity without inclusion, you’re missing the opportunity for your talent to thrive and be engaged as they may not feel that they belong or are valued.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div>Being genuinely valued and respected involves more than just feeling included. It involves having the power to help set the agenda, influence what – and how – work is done, have one’s needs and interests taken into account, and have one’s contributions recognized and rewarded with further opportunities to contribute and advance.</div>

  <h3 id="diversity">Diversity</h3>
  <p>Diversity focuses on understanding that each person is unique and bringing people of all backgrounds into the workplace. When tracking diversity internally, it’s essential to break data down – rather than just looking at how many women or minorities are in an organization, for example, look at how many are in the C-suite and at what point in their career progression these groups are leaving the organization.</p>
  <h3 id="equity">Equity</h3>
  <p>Workplace equity levels the playing field to ensure all employees have the resources and opportunities they need to reach an equal outcome, whereas equality assumes the playing field is already level and treats everyone the same way. When looking at equity in the workplace, tracking all the stages of the employee life cycle is helpful or spotting areas for improvement.</p>
  <h3 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h3>
  <p>Inclusion in the workplace gives all employees a voice and room to thrive. It means that everyone feels comfortable and confident being themselves while also feeling valued, important, and heard. Gathering qualitative perception data anonymously from employees via surveys is key for evaluating if a company’s inclusion efforts are working.</p>

  <h2 id="benefits-of-workplace-diversity">5 benefits of workplace diversity</h2>
  <p>DEI is much more than nice-to-have, and the statistics bear that out. The business case for workplace diversity continues to grow as research continues to show its many tangible benefits, including increased:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Multiple studies show that diverse companies are more profitable. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">McKinsey research</a> concludes that companies in the top 25% for ethnic and cultural diversity were 36% more profitable than those in the bottom quarter, and when women are well represented in the C-suite, profits can be almost 50% higher.</li>
    <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Over and over again, research shows that more diverse organizations are more productive. For example, the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2019.0468">Academy of Management Journal</a> research concludes that “racial diversity in upper and lower management results in greater employee productivity.” In addition, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/?sh=5f8e2c4e4cbf">Forbes</a>, inclusive teams “make better business decisions up to 87% of the time, and they make those decisions twice as fast within half as many meetings.”</li>
    <li><strong>Employee recruitment and retention:</strong> Workplace diversity may be even more important for employees than employers. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/diversity-inclusion-workplace-survey/">Glassdoor reports</a> that 76% of employees and jobseekers say that diversity “is an important factor when evaluating companies and job offers.” And a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/190103/using-employee-engagement-build-diverse-workforce.aspx">Gallup poll</a> found that engaged employees are “more likely to say their company values diverse ideas.”</li>
    <li><strong>Job satisfaction and performance:</strong> A <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/the-business-of-belonging/RES161444">Forrester report</a> shows that when employees feel a sense of belonging at work, it leads to a 56% increase in job performance. That sense of belonging, feeling represented, and feeling respected creates a sense of satisfaction and improves performance – <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/belonging-at-work/">91% of employees</a> who feel they belong are engaged, compared to 20% of those who feel they don’t.</li>
    <li><strong>Innovation and creativity:</strong> Inclusive decisions are better decisions. <a href="http://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Innovation_Through_Diversity.pdf">Forbes</a> found that 85% of business leaders believe that “a diverse and inclusive workforce is crucial to encouraging different perspectives and ideas that drive innovation.” Another <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16903805/">study</a> found that people need to feel safe and supported to contribute innovative, creative ideas. And companies with higher diversity levels see <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance">19% higher innovation revenues</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="workplace-diversity-stats-a-reality-check-by-the-numbers">Workplace diversity stats: A reality check by the numbers</h2>
  <p>Despite the clear benefits of workplace diversity – and despite <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/6-hr-recruiting-stats-you-need-to-know-for-2018-and-beyond/">69% of executives</a> saying diversity is one of their top priorities – there’s still a long way to go to achieve true diversity. These numbers tell the story:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">McKinsey</a>, companies with greater than 30% female executives tend to outperform those with fewer female executives. And yet, McKinsey’s research also showed that women aren’t being promoted to mid-level management positions at the same rate as men, with 85 women promoted for every 100 men promoted.</li>
    <li><a href="https://coqual.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BBICA-Press-Release-Updated.pdf">Coqual research</a> shows that in 2019, Black professionals were “nearly four times as likely as white professionals to say they have experienced racial prejudice at work (58% versus 15%).”</li>
    <li>When all else is equal, résumés from people with “white-sounding” names got callbacks almost 50% more than those with “black-sounding” names, according to <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0418/pages/can-blind-hiring-improve-workplace-diversity.aspx">SHRM</a>.</li>
    <li>A recent study by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law found that “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/half-lgbtq-workers-faced-job-discrimination-report-finds-rcna1935">46%</a> of LGBTQ workers reported receiving unfair treatment at some point in their careers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.”</li>
    <li>Like many types of workplace discrimination, age discrimination is illegal, yet 78% of older workers <a href="https://www.aarp.org/work/working-at-50-plus/info-2019/age-discrimination-in-america.html">report</a> witnessing or experiencing age discrimination, according to <a href="https://www.aarp.org/work/working-at-50-plus/info-2019/age-discrimination-in-america.html">AARP</a> research.</li>
    <li>People with disabilities are extremely underrepresented in the workplace. The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/disabl.t01.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reports that only 20.6% of people with disabilities work in the U.S., while 68.6% of those without disabilities are part of the workforce.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Accountability, transparency, training, commitment, and action are just some of the ways companies can work towards greater diversity in the workplace.</p>

  <h2 id="potential-hybrid-workplace-inequalities">Potential hybrid workplace inequalities</h2>
  <p>As businesses transition to a <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/what-is-a-hybrid-workplace-model.html">hybrid workplace model</a>, they need to be aware of the potential barriers and inequalities that a mix of remote and in-office workers creates. The main risk is that not being seen in person could create barriers to advancement for those who work from home. And since those who work from home tend to be working mothers, minorities, and those with disabilities, this could further exacerbate existing discrimination.</p>
  <p>As an example, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/inequitable-effects-of-pandemic-on-careers/">a joint study from Qualtrics and the Boardlist</a> showed that during the pandemic women and men working remotely with children at home had very different experiences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>9% of women reported receiving a promotion; 34% of men said the same</li>
    <li>13% of women received a pay raise compared to 26% of men</li>
    <li>10% of women took on additional leadership, whereas 29% of men did</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And that’s just statistics about gender diversity. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/06/business/economy/working-from-home-diversity.html">New York Times</a>, “with fewer connections and less extensive networks than white colleagues, to begin with, Black and Hispanic workers can find themselves more isolated than ever in a world of Zoom calls and virtual forums.”</p>
  <p>But it’s not all doom and gloom when it comes to diversity in a hybrid work environment. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/09-17-21-gartner-hr-research-finds-organizations-can-increase-inclusion-by-twenty-four-percent-in-the-hybrid-work-environment">Gartner</a> research shows that “organizations that effectively manage the transition to a hybrid work environment and employ sustainable initiatives can boost inclusion by 24%.” The forced working from home precipitated by the pandemic already had organizations shifting to thinking about how to foster DEI online, and that thinking can also be honed and applied to hybrid arrangements.</p>
  <p>To boost DEI, a hybrid workplace model needs to be explicitly designed with diversity in mind. HR departments can support eliminating bias by tracking promotions, bonuses, pay raises, and more. And managers can be trained on how to recognize and avoid bias and how to create and track bias-free KPIs to ensure employees are being assessed on the same criteria.</p>
  <p>There is an opportunity to use hybrid work opportunities to shape more equitable workplaces, but it needs to be done intentionally and mindfully, and it needs to be tracked.</p>
  <h2 id="using-hr-technology-to-support-workforce-diversity">Using HR technology to support workforce diversity</h2>
  <p>Technology can be a powerful tool for combatting bias and creating diverse, equitable, and inclusive organizations, especially artificial intelligence (AI), which can help spot and reduce conscious and unconscious bias throughout the employee life cycle.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Starting with the recruitment process, <a href="/resources/ai-for-hr">AI for HR</a> can be used to proactively identify gender-biased language in job descriptions and automatically screen candidates based on their qualifications rather than names, genders, and other bias-prone information from applicant profiles. This helps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase the diversity of applicants</li>
    <li>Address unconscious bias</li>
    <li>Drive actionable insights from analytics and metrics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>On an ongoing basis, data from an organization’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html">human capital management</a> (HCM) platform can be used throughout the entire employee life cycle to track promotion rates, retention rates, employee engagement, and more.</p>
  <p>However, AI systems need to be built without human bias creeping into them. Using a broad range of data is imperative, as is eliminating bias at the point of data collection. The Amazon experience is a cautionary tale; gender bias was built into their AI hiring tool because they used biased data to build their AI model.</p>
  <p>When used intentionally, technology can imbue the HR process with a more diverse approach to everything from talent acquisition to employee development. HR technology can also drive better employee engagement and help close gender and racial wage gaps.</p>

        <h1 id="the-changing-role-of-the-cio">The Changing Role of the CIO</h1>
        <p>Major shifts in technology, customer demands, and employee expectations are substantially reshaping the scope and role of CIOs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the last few years, the CIO role has shifted significantly from being a technology provider and part of a delivery unit to operating as a strategic advisor, business partner, and enabler of new business models.</p>
  <p>The commercialization of technology, particularly mobile, means we are also influencing customer demand on an enterprise level. In the cloud era, customers expect solutions to be available all the time and seamlessly integrated on all platforms, including mobile. IT has effectively become part of the product and service itself, and CIOs have become business enablers by driving the transformation of new business models.</p>
  <p>Employee demands have also shifted dramatically, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. A new generation of employees is reforming the way we work and today’s CIOs must have a digital transformation strategy in place to adapt to a new workplace reality and retain talent.</p>
  <p>With that, CIOs and their IT departments have had to create a digital workplace footprint that not only answers to the requirements of their business but also optimizes and drives peak performance from modern employees. None of that is possible without a robust IT infrastructure and strategy. The sheer speed of innovation means that CIOs must also define a business-enabling IT strategy that is agile, scalable, and that leverages new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and robotics to deliver empowering business solutions.</p>
  <h2 id="growth-of-cio-scope-and-role">Growth of CIO scope and role</h2>
  <p>These major shifts in technology, customer demands, and employee expectations are substantially reshaping the scope and role of CIOs who now collaborate with executives across all lines of business to lead their company through the <a href="/resources/what-is-digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> and workplace revolution. In the process, their focus has shifted – from efficiency driver to growth driver, from system provider focused on managing traditional IT operations to the CIO who shapes and creates the digital transformation.</p>
  <p>At SAP, for example, the IT organization has experienced a fantastic transformation from the role of the traditional service provider to be the technology backbone, new business model enabler, and key driver of our digital transformation. IT is not only the technology provider of a company, but drives the business transformation and owns all levers of an intelligent enterprise. Companies that don’t recognize that today will lose their relevance tomorrow.</p>
  <p>In the tech industry in particular, IT departments are also often the first and best reference customer and with that CIOs directly influence product development and strategy. CIOs now speak with the experience and the invaluable voice of a customer, which solidifies their position and influence within their company’s value chain.</p>

  <h2 id="new-responsibilities-and-roles-for-cios">New responsibilities and roles for CIOs</h2>
  <p>As trusted business partners, CIOs now play a key role in many additional functions, including enhancing corporate performance through advanced technology, driving business transformation, improving results through process automation, and ensuring sustainability by driving a solid green IT strategy.</p>
  <p>Important functional areas of a business such as finance, marketing, and HR rely heavily on a superior technology infrastructure and the seamless integration of systems. For example, data and analytics insights can provide the head of sales with a 360-degree view of a customer that they may not have had before.</p>
  <p>Data and analytics drive the Intelligent Enterprise, and a data-driven mindset has become a critical component in the CIO strategy.</p>
  <h2 id="impact-of-the-cloud-and-consumers">Impact of the cloud and consumers</h2>
  <p>The move to the cloud has been an earthquake in terms of the evolution of IT. Not every company is cloud only, but nearly every company now has a cloud-first strategy in place. Whether companies run their businesses completely in the cloud or adopt a hybrid model, there are multiple significant benefits, including lower capital costs and faster access to the latest solutions.</p>
  <p>Employees gain immediate access to corporate information anywhere, anytime, and on any device, increasing their effectiveness and improving customer service. Meanwhile, the cloud gives companies much more flexibility and enables them to respond faster to market trends, shifting demand, and competitors. As a result, they can scale up and down much more easily while only paying for what they use, when they use it.</p>

  <p>For IT and the CIO, this means providing technical and process support for their organization’s cloud-based infrastructure to enable new business models. CIOs are also responsible for ensuring that customers have a great user experience, which in a cloud environment means everything must be integrated, simple, and smart to promote customer loyalty.</p>
  <p>We also see a shift of power from the CIO/technology provider to the customer who now has more choice and can switch solutions more easily. That helps underscore the importance of a customer-first mindset for technology providers in particular.</p>
  <p>In the cloud, one of the most important metrics to really measure customer successes is usage – if a customer isn’t using your (subscription) solution, the likelihood of renewal is not very high. For that, it is imperative for the CIO to provide technical solutions that enable the company to be much closer to the customer, to better understand what they’re using and what type of functionality is potentially still missing.</p>
  <h2 id="the-pandemic-changed-everything">The pandemic changed everything</h2>
  <p>Of course, the other big change that we’ve seen over the last 18 months has been the impact of the pandemic. Employees, customers, and businesses in general depended on IT and CIO capabilities to maintain their organization’s safety and business continuity.</p>
  <p>Almost overnight, employees needed to transition to a remote workplace with seamless access to everything required for performing their job, including all systems, data, and cloud solutions. And they relied on advanced collaborative technologies to maintain their teamwork and shared objectives. For CIOs this was a massive challenge and underscored the importance of having a solid disaster recovery plan.</p>
  <p>We can also see that the pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of most companies’ business processes. That meant simplifying critical processes and combining them with intelligent solutions, automating repetitive processes, and moving to the cloud. It also meant creating greater transparency about supply chains and CO2 footprints, as well as using owned and third-party data to act more proactively with the help of artificial intelligence.</p>
  <p>The pandemic also highlighted the importance of understanding our supply chains and ensuring they are <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/integrated-business-planning/what-is-a-resilient-supply-chain.html">resilient</a> and flexible. Supply shortages are a critical side effect of the pandemic and companies need to react much faster than in the past. For the CIO that means taking on much more responsibility for delivering that agility and making sure the company is running smoothly end-to-end. That puts additional pressure on the CIO, but it can also be very positive because it brings additional credibility to the role as a strategic business enabler.</p>

  <h2 id="four-skills-of-the-future-cio">Four skills of the future CIO</h2>
  <p>Looking ahead, I think there are four key skills and attributes that a successful CIO will need in the future:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Business acumen with a holistic sense of their business and customers:</strong> CIOs must go much deeper into the business and understand their customers to effectively define and drive their organization’s IT strategy. To stay on top of trends and adjust to market conditions, they must have strong data and analytics capabilities and leverage data-driven decision-making to predict and drive the business needs of tomorrow. A CIO’s ability to lead an agile organization that embraces automation and business transformation will be a key differentiator.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic thinking, adaptability, and the ability to see the bigger picture:</strong> Successful CIOs must be able to grasp the bigger picture of the organization, including the business impact of IT decisions, ROI dependencies, and team member needs and challenges. By understanding the full stack of an organization’s needs, the ideal CIO can find, apply, and adapt the right technology to maximize company-wide success. Disruptive thinking plays an important role as well. Technology has proven to be highly disruptive, challenging almost every status quo and business model. CIOs now play one of the most important roles in shaping the business by leading the technology-based future of the organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Leading with empathy, vision, and care:</strong> These CIO attributes are important to successfully lead a team through changes and an unexpected crisis. But they are also necessary to adapt to – and be prepared for – the everyday demands of the future. Change is a constant companion in the business world and drives innovation. Ensuring that employees are adapting to change and are successful is critical. Effective CIOs will have a solid people agenda in place that provides tools, programs, and career planning paths that ensure employees are moving forward within their organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication, transparency, and visibility:</strong> Communication and transparency are critical in all aspects of the CIO’s leadership and business acumen. Being heard, being seen, and being relatable earns trust from customers, peers, and employees and will pave the way for the CIO to become an important business voice. Visibility internally and externally and being a visionary voice and thought leader in their industry will not only foster appreciation, but will also profoundly impact their organization’s business success and can be a key differentiator for success in their respective industry. A successful CIO will have a well-defined internal and external communication strategy.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Sometimes people ask me what it is like to be the CIO of a large technology company. I usually compare it to being the coach of the national soccer team here in Germany. There are millions of people who are interested and capable of talking about soccer, and some may even know the answers better than the coach. The same applies a little bit to the CIO of a tech company. At SAP, my internal customers include over 40,000 developers whose core expertise is technology. It is challenging in all the best ways and keeps me on my toes.</p>

        <p>Technology, empathy, and culture are transforming customer-agent interactions into new revenue gains.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Contact centers were never more important – or more under the gun – than when COVID-19 brought the world to a grinding halt. “March of 2020 stopped us in our tracks,” recalls Jeremy Hyde, director of customer service for Sun Country Airlines. Desperate calls from panic-stricken travelers flooded the airline’s customer service center, while social distancing measures forced many of its employees to work from home without the infrastructure or support of an office setting.</p>
  <p>Sun Country Airlines’ customer service agents weren’t the only ones experiencing turbulence. Overall, contact centers had <a href="https://www.gep.com/blog/mind/impact-of-covid-19-on-contact-centers-and-measures-taken">300%</a> more calls than usual during the early stages of the pandemic. Average handle time skyrocketed from an average of 3 to 6 minutes to more than 10 minutes, creating a cadre of frustrated and angry customers. And about 90% of global contact center agents were forced to work remotely to meet stringent social distancing mandates.</p>
  <p>Nearly two years later, the acute challenges of the pandemic are subsiding, creating space for new opportunities and a reimagined corporate mandate. Forget about drastic cost-cutting measures and meeting age-old success metrics. Rather, COVID-19 has taught organizations valuable lessons about the critical need to embrace sophisticated <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/what-is-crm/crm-technology-trends.html">technologies</a>, experiment with new customer care models, and design customer experience strategies that drive growth and profitability. According to research firm <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-customer-service-and-support-predictions-for-2021-and-beyond">Gartner</a>, “40% of customer service organizations will transform into profit centers by becoming de facto leaders in digital customer engagement.”</p>

  <h2 id="ai-as-a-customer-experience-influencer">AI as a customer experience influencer</h2>
  <p>Currently driving the contact center’s transformation into a revenue generator are artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools, such as chatbots, which can simulate human-like conversations with customers through chat messages.</p>
  <p>An example is Erica, Bank of America’s virtual financial assistant. Using a combination of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/cloud-analytics/what-is-predictive-analytics.html">predictive analytics</a> and natural language processing, Erica helps the bank’s mobile app users pay bills on time, review past transactions, check account balances, and receive personalized, proactive insights and guidance. These capabilities not only help improve customers’ financial health but also provide a fast and efficient alternative to waiting lengthy periods of time to speak with a human agent or visit a brick-and-mortar branch.</p>

        <p>The more we use chatbots and digital assistants, the smarter they’ll become.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="/blogs/lets-talk-about-conversational-ai">Learn more</a></strong></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Agents also benefit from chatbots: by translating complex financial concepts into conversational language, Erica handles routine queries while freeing up agents to focus on more pressing issues. AI-enabled chatbots are expected handle <a href="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/pdf/cxtrends/cx-trends-2020-full-report.pdf">20%</a> of all customer service requests by 2022.</p>
  <p>Another innovative use of AI in customer care is sentiment analysis – a market that is expected to reach US$6 billion by 2023, according to a Market Research Future <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/sentiment-analytics-market-4304">report</a>. And for good reason: by using algorithms to evaluate customer conversations, sentiment analytics tools can detect phrases or tones that may indicate a customer’s increasing frustration during an interaction. By analyzing sentiments associated with certain phrases, organizations can make changes to contact center scripts to avoid unnecessary friction. Conversely, sentiment analytics can flag wording in an interaction, such as a mention of a company’s favorable return policy, that may signal an opportune time to upsell or cross-sell products and services.</p>

  <p>To support safer on-site experiences by social distancing, video banking at automated teller machines (ATMs) is also gaining traction as a viable alternative to in-person customer care. At Tampa Bay Federal Credit Union (FCU), for example, interactive ATMs allow customers to interact with a live agent without having to go inside a branch and wait to speak with a teller. This way, Tampa Bay FCU can continue to build strong relationships with its clients while facilitating faster transactions and extended banking hours.</p>
  <p>“I don’t think video banking is applicable for every instance of customer service, but when there’s an advantage to having a visual connection, it can be very successful,” says Colin Taylor, CEO of The Taylor Reach Group, a customer service consultancy.</p>

  <h2 id="the-importance-of-a-human-touch">The importance of a human touch</h2>
  <p>But technology is only part of the customer care equation. Organizations also must strike the right balance between supporting agents with digital solutions and addressing more complex and personal issues with human empathy and understanding.</p>
  <p>“All good customer interaction and experiences are really centered around what the human can provide to the process,” says Taylor. “The technology can support them and be an extension of them, but it’s got to be architected or orchestrated by a human being. People want to deal with people; they don’t really want to deal with machines.”</p>
  <p>Annette Franz, CEO of CX Journey, a customer experience consultancy, agrees. “Digital experience is less about digital and more about people,” Franz says. “Digital transformation is about meeting the needs of the connected customer and changing your processes to do so. But companies must keep in mind that the more technologically advanced they become, the more people want that human interaction. There’s a lot of fear that AI and automation will take the ‘human’ out of everything. Digital is great, but one of the things we learned last year was that we still need social and human interactions, too.”</p>
  <p>However, good interactions with human representatives hinge on their agency to empathize, understand, and respond to customers’ problems. Today’s customers are savvy enough to know the difference between an authentic interaction and a purely scripted one – so agents must have the autonomy to act on their instincts and make critical decisions on the fly.</p>

  <p>This is the key difference between cost-focused and customer-focused organizations, says Jeff Toister, author of <em>Getting Service Right: Overcoming the Hidden Obstacles to Outstanding Customer Service</em> and founder of Toister Performance Solutions. “In a cost-focused company, an agent might be severely restricted in terms of what they’re able to do,” he explains.</p>
  <p>“Even in a situation with a clear and obvious error, they’re not empowered to resolve it. In a customer-focused organization, however, that agent has been empowered to not only fix obvious errors but to act in areas that aren’t so clear and obvious.”</p>
  <p>Toister points to an encounter with Chewy, an online retailer of pet food and pet-related products. After receiving a shipment of dog food shortly after his dog passed away, Toister says he contacted Chewy’s contact center for support. “A cost-focused company would say, ‘Here’s the return process and here’s how I’ll make you jump through these hoops.’ Instead, the Chewy agent encouraged me to donate the food to a local shelter.”</p>
  <p>For some organizations, empowering agents to make in-the-moment recommendations requires a loosening of strict policies and procedures while granting agents permission “to deviate from the script when it’s warranted,” according to Toister. “A combination of processes, authority, and resources empowers agents to make customer-focused decisions.”</p>

  </p>
  <h2 id="a-question-of-culture">A question of culture</h2>
  <p>But culture can also play a role in extending an agent’s powers. Just ask Steffanie Wilk, professor of management and human resources at the Fisher College of Business, Ohio State University. Wilk says an agent’s powers are determined by “the way the job of [an agent] is structured – with autonomy and control – and the voice they have in terms of their role.”</p>
  <p>For instance, organizations that attach little value to the role of contact center agent often deploy complex technologies that fail to properly consider the impact they’ll have on an agent’s day-to-day activities. This indifference can lead to a variety of problems, including poor digital adoption and high agent turnover.</p>
  <p>Wilk says, “I can’t tell you the number of times technology has been rolled out to agents with very little input” into the functionality and features they need to do their job well. Rather, companies that aim to empower their agents “involve people on the frontlines, which is a really meaningful way to hear what changes should be made” when it comes to both deploying technology and creating positive customer experiences.</p>

  <h2 id="empower-employees-and-customers-alike">Empower employees and customers alike</h2>
  <p>Many organizations are discovering the correlation between employee experience and customer experience. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2018/02/23/the-un-ignorable-link-between-employee-experience-and-customer-experience/?sh=877e2b148dc1">Studies</a> show that companies whose employees are more engaged are more likely to excel at customer experience and drive sustainable growth. That’s not always easy, especially in industries hard-hit by the pandemic. Just ask Hyde of Sun Country Airlines. “The pandemic has been hard on so many people,” he says. “We try to help our team members stay grounded because they’re dealing with some challenging conversations – it’s important that we don’t lose sight of what our agents are going through.”</p>
  <p>One way that Sun Country Airlines supports its agents is by providing them with easy access to up-to-date information on everything from refund policies to airline safety requirements. Rather than “pull people into meetings,” Hyde says, an internal knowledge base provides agents with critical information “in real time, even as things change.” This significantly enhances an agent’s ability to provide customers with timely and accurate information.</p>
  <p>Self-service is another key trend helping to redefine customer care. In the case of Sun Country Airlines, Hyde says, “We focused on how we could get information to customers without having to rely on one-on-one interactions.” One solution: send customers personalized emails advising them on everything from pandemic-related travel restrictions to vaccine requirements, based on their unique travel itineraries.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div data-valign="middle">Customers are very happy to use self-service for simple transactions. But they’re even more likely to experiment with self-service if they know finding a real person is just a simple click away.</div>

  </div>
  <p>But self-service isn’t about leaving customers to their own devices. The best experience is one in which companies strike the right balance between enabling customers to help themselves and letting them know where to turn for additional assistance. Says Toister, “Customers are very happy to use self-service for simple transactions. But they’re even more likely to experiment with self-service if they know finding a real person is just a simple click away.”</p>

  <p>In response to this demand for seamless transitions across channels, many companies are turning to a new and innovative contact strategy known as right-channeling. According to a Deloitte Digital <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/offerings/customer-led-marketing/digital-customer/elevating-customer-service.html">survey</a>, 36% of leaders say that despite the ongoing proliferation of service channels, customers primarily rely on the phone, one of the costliest – and most frustrating – ways for agents to connect with customers. Right-channeling addresses this challenge by meeting customers where they are in their journey and seamlessly guiding them to the most appropriate channel using techniques such as personalized messaging, promotional offers, and custom content.</p>
  <p>Certainly, the most appropriate channel may not always mesh with a customer’s perceived channel preference. This, though, is the challenge presented to today’s contact center agents – to respond to customer queries in a fast and efficient manner while elevating the customer experience. Achieving this outcome requires a combination of the right technologies, a human touch, and willingness to empower agents and customers alike. Successful businesses can transform the contact center from a cost-cutting entity into a revenue generator – and the heart of a company’s customer experience.</p>

        <p>Augmented reality is helping manufacturing workers conduct assembly, repairs, and service quicker and more accurately.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By Michael Spiess and Thomas Eckert</p>
  <p>Making any aircraft is a complex process that involves many parts, many workers, and many possibilities for error – and absolutely no room for mistakes.</p>
  <p>GE Aviation makes the engines and avionics for global airlines, including those that power Boeing and Airbus planes. To help its workers who assemble these engines minimize mistakes and work faster, GE Aviation tried out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5gXuZp25f0">wearable augmented reality (AR)</a>. The smart glasses provide assembly information hands-free, putting instructions right in front of workers’ eyes, literally – no more pausing or looking away from their tasks to check printed reference materials or a computer screen.</p>
  <p>The GE Aviation pilot was intended to help mechanics use a Wi-Fi torque wrench to better tighten bolts, which it did. But the company also discovered that the mechanics worked faster and completed jobs quicker because they no longer needed to look away from their task or climb up and down stairs to check a printed manual or pick up tools and parts.</p>
  <p>And therein lies the promise of <a href="https://insights.sap.com/tag/augmented-reality-ar/">augmented reality</a> in <a href="https://insights.sap.com/tag/manufacturing/">manufacturing</a>: assembling better products, making them faster, and creating a healthier work environment. The technology, along with others like machine learning, AI, and robotics, is changing how factories operate and helping humans do their jobs better, safer, and quicker. Part of the next revolution in productivity, AR can give workers expertise that normally would take years of experience and education to gain. For organizations, AR could leverage a digital archive of human knowledge and provide virtual training environments for workers to learn new skills and collaborate.</p>
  <p>The most promising uses bring efficiencies to business processes, including assembly work, repairs and field service, and designs of new manufacturing spaces. Using AR for manufacturing can help technicians make repairs faster by guiding them to the problem and providing information on repairs and needed parts.</p>
  <p>GE Aviation’s assembly process is one example. Beyond the production line, the pandemic’s travel and contact restrictions got a lot of companies interested in remote maintenance and using AR to guide fixes, as <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-makes-ars-potential-a-reality-for-chip-makers-11591789742">noted</a>. In some contexts, such as oil and gas platforms, this technology is justified because it’s less expensive than the US$10,000 or more it costs each trip to send a person out to a rig, often on a helicopter, says Inderpreet Shoker, senior analyst at ARC Advisory Group. Instead, an employee already on the platform can use an AR-powered device to receive instructions and guidance from an off-site expert.</p>
  <p>Rather than dispatching a person to the field, these companies look to augmented reality. “They’re saying, ‘First, let’s use an AR headset and try to solve this problem with hands-on guidance for the crew on a rig,’” Shoker says.</p>

  <h2 id="from-fantasy-to-factory">From fantasy to factory</h2>
  <p>Augmented reality began in a <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-mainstreaming-of-augmented-reality-a-brief-history">lab at Harvard</a> back in the 1960s, and over the years, it has been used for defense, sports, and entertainment and gaming applications, among <a href="/resources/science-tech-dogs-make-world-safer">others</a>. But these new industrial applications aren’t about capturing Pokémon. AR wearables are emerging as a viable option for workers because of better materials, batteries, and computing power packed small.</p>
  <p>These systems work by overlaying a connected graphic interface through AR software on top of reality, so, for example, workers on a production line wearing AR glasses will see the component they’re working on plus an instruction diagnostic or a video showing them what to do. AR can also be used with smartphones and tablets (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&#x26;v=Pi38_SuaTBg&#x26;feature=youtu.be">as this brief video shows</a>), which are held in front of a machine, component, or other object.</p>
  <p>For complex products, AR is particularly useful because a human might find it tough to remember the many parts and assembly specifics required. An AR application can provide that for them as they work.</p>
  <p>ARC Advisory Group projects that AR applications for industry will grow 21.2% between 2019 and 2023, driven by the defense, oil and gas, and chemical industries. The biggest use cases now are collaboration and training, says Shoker. The pandemic caused many companies to pause their technology investments, but there were exceptions, says Shoker, and one of those was AR.</p>
  <p>AR is particularly useful because a human might find it tough to remember the many parts and assembly specifics required. An AR application can provide that for them as they work.</p>
  <p>“With augmented reality, an interesting thing that we saw was that because one of the major applications of this technology is remote collaboration, a lot of the companies that were doing some pilot projects quickly wanted to scale the technology,” she says.</p>
  <p>Using AR for training and sales also experienced a bump. One example is German industrial 3D printing company EOS and its Additive Minds Academy, which has developed a training platform using AR for its 3D printing machines, says Volker Kunze, team manager for digital solutions.</p>
  <p>The Additive Minds Academy’s AR <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV_LdSUfaN0">application</a> lets a customer walk around a virtual machine, open doors, and check under the hood, so to speak, and learn all about how it works without actually touching a physical machine. The Academy’s AR training guides a new user step by step. It’s scalable, and newbies can never damage equipment.</p>

  <p>“You can have a machine appear everywhere, and even a customer can do it. They can pre-educate the employees and get a feeling for the machine,” says Kunze.</p>
  <p>EOS also uses it to do sales demonstrations, which was particularly useful during the pandemic.</p>
  <p>“During [the pandemic], we had a customer 2,000 kilometers away and they said, ‘Hey, I cannot come over to you, you cannot come over to me, I cannot enter your showroom, and you cannot explain your machine to me. What can we do?’” says Kunze. The solution: EOS streamed the live presentation through HoloLens 2 and Microsoft Teams directly to the customer, who could interactively point out the areas of importance.</p>
  <p>AR can also bring clarity to repairs and servicing. Typically, a technician would need a service order and then approach a machine to identify the various pieces that needed to be replaced and ordered. But a visual AR-based approach is more user-friendly. A 3D model can be overlayed on the physical object, a feature called visual tracking.</p>
  <p>In this scenario, a technician could scan a QR code or a machine ID and then select any component, down to each screw and washer, with a touch on a tablet or a voice command. Because the information is coming from the 3D model, there’s a high level of confidence that the part is the correct part. Other information can also be accessed, like how long it will take for a part to be delivered. Then there’s the visual guidance for doing the actual repairs. That’s available in the AR view, too.</p>

  <h2 id="augmented-reality-beyond-assembly-maintenance-and-repair">Augmented reality beyond assembly, maintenance, and repair</h2>
  <p>Getting started with AR is becoming easier because some industrial supply companies offer AR as a Service as an add-on to their current products and Software as a Service (SaaS), says ARC’s Shoker.</p>
  <p>There are augmented reality applications in addition to assembly, maintenance, and repair. For example, the technology can help determine whether new equipment fits into a particular factory space, a try-before-you-buy application called virtual commissioning. This is when a machine is validated pre-purchase. The customer can interact with a virtual representation of a machine to see if it will fit in the space they have and if it can connect with their existing backend system – and to assess how the machine interacts with other systems.</p>
  <p>By using AR, a company can avoid creating physical prototypes, which are often costly and time-consuming to make.</p>
  <p>Another use case for AR is in product design. By using AR, a company can avoid creating physical prototypes, which are often costly and time-consuming to make. Instead, they can use data from the product’s 3D models within a CAD system. The designers and engineers can then walk around their virtual prototype, view it from different perspectives, and interact with it.</p>
  <p>Sounds fun, right? But any AR beginner should carefully consider what to make their first project, whether it’s a new product design or an existing machine assembly. Begin by choosing a simple pilot project like a small training module (such as the case of an assembly process). Once a team has completed that pilot and scaled it more broadly, the knowledge gained can be used with a more complex case. For something like a production line, start with simpler or smaller parts. But not too small – parts that are measured in millimeters or smaller are too tiny. Round edges and cables also can be more difficult, although not impossible, to track.</p>

  <h2 id="ar-we-there-yet">AR we there yet?</h2>
  <p>Before augmented reality in manufacturing becomes omnipresent in every factory and innovation lab, the technology requires some refinements. In some places, it also will need to overcome organizational resistance to adoption.</p>
  <p>For a start, we need better devices. The current wearable models are too bulky and uncomfortable for wearing all day. They need better batteries. And they’re expensive. From a performance standpoint, tablets are better, but they are not, of course, hands-free, which in some situations makes them less useful. And in some venues, there are concerns about contamination. Setting down an iPad or touching it after handling something else risks getting it and other parts of an environment dirty – which for some, such as 3D-printing company EOS, is nonnegotiable.</p>
  <p>“We need hands-free installation on a machine,” says EOS’s Kunze. “Otherwise, you could have contamination.”</p>
  <p>Several companies are working to make better and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-apple-and-niantic-bet-people-are-ready-for-augmented-reality-glasses-11617713387">more wearable</a> wearables, but a sophisticated model could be a decade away, says Shoker. Although, she points out, the choice of a wearable or holdable is very dependent on how it will be used; not every situation calls for an all-day wearable.</p>
  <p>“Even Microsoft calls the HoloLens situational,” she says. “You don’t use it all the time.”</p>
  <p>Kunze, however, says devices don’t matter as much as getting the backend up and running because he expects devices to eventually update every two or three years, like most devices do now.</p>
  <p>“My vision is in the midterm with each machine; we send out to a customer smart glasses prefilled with commissioning of the machine, machine training, service maintenance, and remote support,” he says.</p>
  <p>Before augmented reality in manufacturing becomes omnipresent in every factory and innovation lab, the technology requires some refinements.</p>
  <p>The bigger hurdle for some manufacturers may be completing their <a href="/resources/you-say-you-want-an-evolution-how-change-is-changing">digital transformations</a> first. They’ll need to get all of their product 3D models captured and updated in a backend system. Also, their machines need to be <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">Industrial Internet of Things</a> (IIoT) capable for that data flow. And those 3D models need to be loaded into an AR application.</p>
  <p>Some are simply waiting for a bit of our current disruptions to settle down before making an investment in an emerging technology like AR. Needing to support the investment and an unknown ROI time frame is a hard sell, says Shoker. “Especially with newer technology, it’s tough to justify costs,” she says.</p>

        <h3 id="digital-transformation">Digital Transformation</h3>

        <p><strong><a href="/resources/what-is-digital-transformation">Learn more</a></strong></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Organizational buy-in from plant managers and employees is another adoption challenge. Managers and higher-ups may not relish the idea of training all their production personnel.</p>
  <p>Customers are looking for a mature product that they can use right out of the box and that does exactly what they need. They also want enterprise resource planning (ERP) integrations so that they’re not running a standalone product. What’s needed is a holistic soup-to-nuts approach that covers, for example, everything an AR-utilizing field technician needs, from visually guiding a repair while they’re working to signing off on the service order once they’re done.</p>
  <p>Shoker sees a future in which sophisticated headsets are comfortable – and useful – enough to be worn throughout a workday or shift. It’ll be like wearing regular old glasses, with the AR activated when needed. “For most of the day, they’re wearing regular glasses. And then from time to time, when they need the AR applications to help them with their work, they get that kind of capability,” she says.</p>
  <p>AR in manufacturing lets people get a new view of their work, enabling more efficient ways of creating products and doing business. In areas such as training a new crop of workers and reimagining product development, augmented reality offers a fresh perspective that will help make airplanes safer, training easier, and production faster.</p>

  <h2 id="employing-augmented-reality-to-ease-a-skills-shortage">Employing Augmented Reality to Ease a Skills Shortage</h2>
  <p>At the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology’s</a> engineering college, assistant professor <a href="https://www.rit.edu/directory/ywzeie-yunbo-zhang">Yunbo Zhang</a> and his colleagues are working on a <a href="https://www.rit.edu/news/researchers-develop-manufacturing-training-will-include-ai-and-virtual-reality-technology">training platform</a> that uses augmented reality.</p>
  <p>The goal of the platform, which also uses virtual reality, is to help alleviate a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/manufacturing/manufacturing-industry-diversity.html">manufacturing skills shortage</a> (that Deloitte says could leave more than two million jobs unfilled by 2030) by providing remote virtual training that is quicker to complete than conventional training. The platform also makes training accessible to those who don’t have local facilities to do it.</p>
  <p>For example, explains Zhang, machining is an important part of manufacturing. Cutting tools are used to cut raw material into very precise parts for industries like aerospace. It takes a lot of skill and experience to do it well, however, and mistakes are costly. Training workers, usually done by apprenticeship, is also costly and time-consuming. “Those machines are precise and require very careful usage,” says Zhang. “New workers constantly mess up, and sometimes it’s even dangerous for them to operate the machine for some complex tasks.”</p>
  <p>With an AR-based training program, the danger is eliminated, and mistakes are just learning experiences. Plus, it’s more efficient: Trainers don’t need to take time out from the job to teach newbies, and trainees can do the training at their own pace, wherever they are.</p>
  <p>According to Zhang, next steps include figuring out haptic feedback so that trainees will “feel” what they’re doing and how the machine behaves, like when it vibrates. “I’m looking at how to make these kinds of hands-on activities as real as possible,” he says.</p>

  <p>For nearly four years, Triarchy struggled to carve out a place for itself as a manufacturer of luxury designer jeans in a highly saturated marketplace. Adam Taubenfligel, who launched the California-based Triarchy in 2012 with his siblings Ania and Mark, describes an “uphill battle of just trying to get in front of people’s eyes.”</p>
  <p>That changed, however, the day Taubenfligel discovered the water-guzzling wastefulness of making jeans while visiting a denim production factory in China. It can take approximately 2,900 gallons of water to make one pair of traditional cotton jeans from crop to final product. That’s equivalent to nearly 11,000 one-liter bottles of water.</p>
  <p>Not content to be “just another irresponsibly consumptive denim brand,” Taubenfligel says he and his team completely overhauled the company into a luxury wholesaler committed to the highest standards of sustainability. This includes using eco-friendly materials like certified organic cotton, recycled cotton, hemp, and natural rubber, as well as adopting practices such as recycling any wastewater that is produced and limiting the use of chemicals in production.</p>
  <p>But these days, it’s not enough to simply adopt eco-friendly practices, especially if a company wants to gain a competitive edge. A flood of misleading marketing campaigns, unsubstantiated claims, and other acts of greenwashing have eroded customer trust. As a result, many customers now want to be able to verify that companies are doing what they say they are doing.</p>
  <p>To meet these demands, a growing number of companies are taking steps not only to adopt sustainable practices, but prove their veracity beyond a shadow of a doubt. If successful, the result is a trifecta of rewards: a cleaner planet, the public’s trust, and better business outcomes.</p>
  <p>Indeed, Triarchy’s shift wasn’t just to an environmentally friendly manufacturing process – it was a repositioning of its brand to stand apart from rivals. “We made the switch because we were horrified with what we saw in denim production,” says Taubenfligel. “But at the end of the day, it’s the smartest business decision we ever made.”</p>
  <p>Since then, Triarchy has increased revenue by 90% and its luxury denim products, ranging from lightweight button-down shirts to 70s-inspired wide leg jeans, can be purchased from some of today’s top retailers, including Shopbop, Revolve, and Nordstrom, as well as Triarchy’s Web site.</p>

  <p>To substantiate its sustainability claims, Triarchy makes its eco-friendly practices completely <a href="/resources/values-in-plain-sight-future-transparency-through-tech">transparent</a> to customers through its marketing. But Triarchy doesn’t presume that customers will automatically trust its word. To cement the bond of trust, Triarchy also has its practices validated by third-party sources.</p>
  <p>The term for this external stamp of approval is <em>ecolabeling</em>: the practice of using recognizable and reputable symbols to demonstrate that a company’s products and services are genuinely better for the environment than comparable products. To date, Triarchy’s ecolabels range in scope from PETA’s Approved Vegan to the Global Organic Textile Standard and Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals.</p>
  <p>Triarchy is not the only company to discover the competitive advantage of transparency in building customer trust. Today, some of the world’s biggest brands – from retail clothing chain H&#x26;M to coffee behemoth Starbucks – are embracing some of the highest sustainability standards. And they’re relying on a variety of approaches to back up their claims: from increasing visibility into supply chains, to receiving certification from well-known regulatory bodies, to savvy product design. These initiatives are providing companies with an opportunity to not only do good but also stand apart in crowded markets.</p>

  <h2 id="transparency-through-esg-labeling">Transparency through ESG labeling</h2>
  <p>Ecolabels date back as far as 1978, when the German government created the Blue Angel, a label awarded to companies whose products and services meet stringent environmental design standards. But what began as a stamp of approval has evolved into a strategy keenly adopted by businesses that want to both target much sought-after customers and establish a reputation as a responsible brand.</p>
  <p>Today, ecolabels from the Fairtrade Foundation, the Global Organic Textile Standard, USDA Organic, LEED, OEKO-TEX, and many more are fighting for white space on the packages of millions of products and services around the world. And not just the ones you find in patchouli-scented natural food stores.</p>
  <p>It’s easy to understand ecolabeling’s increasing popularity. According to an IBM Institute for Business Value <a href="https://cdn.nrf.com/sites/default/files/2020-01/Meet%202020%20consumers%20driving%20change_01_0.pdf">survey</a> conducted in association with the National Retail Foundation, 57% of consumers are willing to change their purchasing habits to help reduce negative environmental impact. And 71% of those who indicated that traceability is very important are willing to pay a premium for brands that provide it.</p>

  <h2 id="power-to-the-young-people">Power to the young people</h2>
  <p>These figures are only likely to rise as younger generations gain more buying power. An SAP Insights research <a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/social-impact-in-business.html">report</a> identified 20% of respondents as the Passionates – a group whose strong feelings about important global issues such as sustainability directly influence their purchasing and employment decisions. For instance, the Passionates care 18% more about sustainable sourcing, and 33% more about climate change, than other respondents. Primarily comprised of younger Millennials and Gen-Zers, Passionates will grow to become more dominant over time, making them an increasingly influential market force to reckon with.</p>
  <p>Together, these eco-conscious customer segments are giving brands good reason to clean up their acts. “In the last few years, customer demand for sustainable products has risen dramatically,” says Sandra Capponi, co-founder of Good On You, an Australian ethical ratings provider. “In fashion, the majority of people now say they are actively looking for sustainable brands, and they’re putting their money where their mouth is – spending more consciously than ever before.”</p>
  <p>Case in point: in early 2020, retail giant Walmart ran a signage campaign in a select group of stores, advertising the company’s investment in sustainable seafood. The result: a 25% <a href="https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/foodservice-retail/walmart-links-sustainability-initiative-to-higher-seafood-sales">improvement</a> in fresh seafood sales compared to the rest of Walmart’s U.S. stores.</p>

  <h2 id="how-transparency-spurs-innovation">How transparency spurs innovation</h2>
  <p>Another business benefit of transparency is its power to spur innovation in sustainability techniques. Take Triarchy, for example. The company has eliminated using water to pre-wash jeans to give them a slightly bleached or lived-in look by instead taking air from the atmosphere and transforming it into ozone using specialized machinery. Particles of ozone then are released inside the washing machine, producing a vintage-style effect without the harmful use of chemicals such as bleach.</p>
  <p>Other innovations employed by Triarchy include laser technologies that distress and add details to denim without any toxic sprays, and e-flow technology, which uses non-toxic enzymes on the skin of nano bubbles. When these nano bubbles come into contact with the jeans, they burst and create an abrasion similar to stone washing, using only minimal amounts of water and producing very little waste.</p>
  <p>“The goal is to create a vintage-looking pair of jeans that appear as though they’ve been thrown into a vat of bleach but actually have been made using only a glass of water, instead of the hundreds of liters normally reserved for that process,” says Taubenfligel.</p>
  <h2 id="why-customers-dont-trust-brands-sustainability-claims">Why customers don’t trust brands’ sustainability claims</h2>
  <p>But for transparency to deliver a true competitive edge, companies must first gain buyers’ trust. That’s not always easy: only one out of five consumers say they would trust information given by a company itself regarding sustainability practices, according to an Ipsos Mori survey of 7,000 consumers for the <a href="https://changingmarkets.org/">Changing Markets Foundation</a>. Unfortunately, this mistrust is well-founded. According to a <a href="https://icpen.org/news/1147">review</a> by the International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network, as many as 40% of the sustainability claims made online could be misleading.</p>
  <p>Part of the problem is that third-party affirmations of sustainable practices come from a wide variety of sources, ranging from federal agencies to grassroots organizations. For example, there are ecolabels with the backing of governments, those that have been developed by companies, in collaborations with NGOs, by foundations, with various forms of non-profits, and those backed by private actors, says Graeme Auld, professor of comparative and global environmental politics and policy at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.</p>
  <p>And then there’s the all-too-common occurrence of <em>greenwashing</em>. “Brands are providing some very vague claims but these backfire because, eventually, people don’t see the company as authentic,” says Magali Delmas, author of <em>The Green Bundle: Pairing the Market with the Planet</em>. “They go too far claiming an environmental benefit that’s not really clear or substantiated – and that’s really a problem.”</p>

  <h2 id="strategies-for-sustainable-trust">Strategies for sustainable trust</h2>
  <p>The good news is brands are finding new and innovative ways to signal to an increasingly educated customer that they are doing good for the planet, and that their sustainability claims can be believed. Third-party auditing and rating systems are a good way to do this; they fill a vacuum created by a lack of universal standards for sustainability across industries.</p>
  <p>For instance, Triarchy relies on Green Story, a third-party platform, to conduct data-driven analyses of the company’s supply chain sustainability: information that is then published on Triarchy’s Web site using informative graphics. These metrics include how many kilometers of travel-related emissions the company has avoided, days of drinking water saved, hours of lightbulb energy conserved, and total square meters of pesticide-free farmland used to grow the cotton for Triarchy’s jeans.</p>
  <p>Although clients pay Green Story to have their practices reviewed, Taubenfligel says Green Story “vets all the sustainability practices we follow and then publishes this information independently. We don’t have the ability to access or edit these findings to make us look better as a company.”</p>
  <h2 id="the-challenges-that-remain">The challenges that remain</h2>
  <p>Yet there are still challenges companies must overcome if they wish to reap the business benefits of transparency. For starters, Delmas warns that the process of earning certification from well-respected agencies is often “a long one.” Even then, there’s no guarantee of winning over customers.</p>
  <p>“One of the biggest challenges is customer confusion,” says Charles Corbett, professor of operations management and sustainability at the Anderson School of Management, UCLA. “There are many labels with partly overlapping objectives and widely varying degrees of verification and stringency. Customers cannot possibly keep up; even individuals who are experts in sustainability have a hard time deciding how to interpret the variety of labels they see in the stores.”</p>
  <p>Luckily, organizations such as ISEAL Alliance are taking steps to create some order in the chaotic world of third-party verification, says Corbett. Comprised of more than 200 global organizations, the ISEAL Alliance has developed a set of principles for companies, governments, and NGOs to use as a framework for benchmarking sustainability efforts or internal audits.</p>

  <h2 id="make-trust-all-encompassing">Make trust all-encompassing</h2>
  <p>Done right, transparency is an important part of building trust with customers. But it’s important not to see it as a panacea. Brands can most effectively encourage sustainable purchases by “bundling” their sustainability transparency with five other key attributes: quality, status, health, money, and emotion, says Delmas. She offers the example of Tesla. The electric car manufacturer has built its success on performance, aesthetics, and acceleration, not just environmental impact.</p>
  <p>“Brands have to think about the environment <em>and</em> develop products that have superior quality,” says Delmas. “That’s how you gain a competitive advantage.”</p>
  <p>Clearly, however, transparency offers brands a big opportunity. Consumer demand for sustainability is high, and supply is low and often questionable. This means that companies that do it right will have a good chance of winning. The key is to tap into innovative technologies and business strategies that will not only sustain the planet – but also customers’ trust.</p>

      </div>

  </div>
  <p>In the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/04/09/metro/they-came-vermont-pandemic-retreat-now-some-are-putting-down-roots/">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-life-changes-when-you-move-from-the-city-to-the-country-2019-04-02">reports</a> of urbanites moving to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/rural-life-cities-countryside-covid-coronavirus-united-states-us-usa-america/">country</a>. The reason was straightforward: Fewer neighbors made social distancing and, by extension, healthy living easier. Many people also learned that they could work from anywhere because their jobs did not require commuting to an office.</p>
  <p>But the truth is that <a href="/research/creating-the-cities-of-the-future">cities</a> were never going away. More than half of the world’s people – about 55% – live in urban centers, and this majority is expected to reach close to <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/10/1076532">70% by 2050</a>, according to the United Nations. Even during the pandemic, cities demonstrated their vitality by providing critical services at a time when officials raced to address both a healthcare crisis and resource constraints.</p>
  <p>Cities remain economic engines, even as people in many regions have shifted to <a href="/resources/remote-work-new-normal">at-home</a> and then <a href="/resources/tailoring-post-pandemic-work-environment-to-employee-strengths-personality">hybrid work</a> arrangements. Indeed, cities still provide critical infrastructure for business, says Anders Lisdorf, a Copenhagen-based consultant and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demystifying-Smart-Cities-Perspectives-Technologies-ebook/dp/B082KJ1HJX/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&#x26;keywords=anders+lisdorf&#x26;qid=1622571983&#x26;s=books&#x26;sr=1-2">Demystifying Smart Cities: Practical Perspectives on How Cities Can Leverage The Potential of New Technologies</a>.</p>
  <p>“The city is and will continue to be the space where the vast majority of business will be done,” says Lisdorf. “Cities will provide the backdrop for future business. Understanding where smart cities are going impacts the future of most businesses.”</p>
  <p>This article highlights the work of three regional governments – Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; Heidelberg, Germany; and Chattanooga, Tennessee – to illustrate the ways in which government, academic, and business collaborations have used data to serve the needs of their constituencies on a shoestring while managing multiple stakeholders. They are role models for business leaders who are looking to do more with – and get more out of – their data. They offer lessons, including how combining existing and new data sources can derive fresh sources of value, how the use of sensor data can predict demand for services, how harvesting and analyzing location data can isolate safety hazards and mitigate public safety risks – and how data that is properly prepared for sharing and analysis can make for an ever-growing set of valuable applications.</p>
  <h2 id="understanding-quality-of-life-measures-with-real-time-data">Understanding quality-of-life measures with real-time data</h2>
  <p><strong>The project:</strong> Newcastle upon Tyne, a city of 268,000 in the UK, developed an urban data <a href="https://covid.view.urbanobservatory.ac.uk/#intro">dashboard</a> powered by advanced analytics that helps city officials and residents understand metrics that affect residents’ health and safety, including compliance with social distancing measures.</p>
  <p><strong>Major benefits:</strong> The dashboard provides an accurate assessment of the population’s performance on COVID-19 safety measures along with a host of other measures, including vehicle and pedestrian movement, air quality, and wind speed measures in real time.</p>
  <p>During the pandemic, it was crucial for cities to understand how well their citizens were complying with safety guidelines such as social distancing. But other than conventional observation, for example, reviewing CCTV footage, it was difficult to systematically gauge compliance levels. The city of Newcastle upon Tyne completed a pilot project to test if it could do just that, working with Newcastle University to provide <a href="https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/">an online data portal</a> that shows pedestrian congestion in the city center, among other highlights.</p>
  <p>Using a traffic light indicator system with red, green, and yellow lights, the Newcastle Urban Observatory uses advanced analytics to measure pedestrian density and to determine the pedestrians’ proximity to each other. The system strips out personally identifiable details, anonymously identifying people who maintain safe distances while flagging (in red) instances where social distancing measures are violated. During the height of the pandemic, the project team hypothesized that this insight could help public officials make evidence-based decisions, such as understanding what messages would best promote public health.</p>

The managers also use the dashboard to monitor movement around the city such as traffic and <a href="https://howbusyistoon.com/">pedestrian flow</a> and congestion, <a href="https://howbusyistoon.com/parking.html">car park occupancy</a>, and bus GPS trackers. It also tracks energy consumption, air quality, and noise levels.</p>

  <p>A key value driver for the dashboard: real-time data. The main goal for the project was to measure the impact of policy decisions (such as the recommendation to maintain social distance) in real time, says Phil James, director of the National Urban Observatory Facility and professor of Urban Data at Newcastle University. Having the data enables fundamentally new types of policies, says James. For example, if the dashboard shows congestion in the city center, the city could elect to assess pollution charges on drivers who come into town. To be clear, Newcastle upon Tyne is not doing this now – and may not ever – but having the data enables what James calls “thought experiments.”</p>
  <p>“We can imagine a city where we manage traffic flows or charges for private vehicles based on things like air quality. You can start to tie those things together,” he says.</p>
  <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The dashboard project sets the table for future public service improvements and improved quality of life.</p>
  <p>Jenny Nelson, digital program manager for the city of Newcastle, believes analytics technology that observes and extrapolates from human behavior will be a pillar of future urban management because the results of <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-analytics/">analytics</a> can drive informed policy discussions.</p>
  <p>“Real-time data gives you the potential to create new and different types of decision-making” and to adjust as needed according to conditions, says Nelson.</p>

  <h2 id="sensor-data-enables-smart-resource-management">Sensor data enables smart resource management</h2>
  <p><strong>The project:</strong> Smart waste management powered by sensor data helped Heidelberg, Germany optimize trash and recycling collection as needs proved variable during the pandemic.</p>
  <p><strong>Major benefits:</strong> Fewer truck runs saves time, labor, and fuel consumption and reduces emissions without affecting service quality.</p>
  <p>With 160,000 residents, Heidelberg, a city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, is a leader at deploying digital technology to improve life for its citizens while boosting sustainability. The city’s digital spinoff, <a href="https://www.heidelberg.de/1192695.html">Digital-Agentur Heidelberg GmbH</a>, features a number of projects, including more efficient <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2019/11/07/how-governments-use-ai-to-create-better-experiences-for-citizens/?sh=1084056a799c">trash collection driven by sensor data</a>. Trash receptacles outfitted with sensors help city managers track the waste levels in real time through a cloud-based dashboard.</p>
  <p>“Instead of traveling to very isolated parts of the city in the forest every second week, the [truck fleet provider can] make data-based decisions on whether to make the trip. On the other hand, we will get an early notice if containers are overflowing, which leads to a nicer cityscape and fewer citizen complaints,” says Sebastian Warkentin, managing director, Digital-Agentur. Trash collection is therefore a more efficient and eco-friendly option during a time of volatile trash needs, helping the city achieve its sustainability goals.</p>
  <p>The smart waste-management system has significantly reduced the noise level, street congestion, and air quality for residents, says Warkentin. It also helps Heidelberg analyze and forecast future waste management needs. The system uses a host of technologies, including <a href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-iot-internet-of-things/">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> sensors, low-power wide-area network, cloud storage, and software.</p>
  <p>As cities slowly come back, waste management systems powered by real-time sensor data prevent the inefficiency of doing pickups in areas that have not yet come back to their previous waste levels.</p>
  <p>The smart waste management system has significantly reduced the noise level, street congestion, and air quality for residents. It also helps the city of Heidelberg forecast future waste-management needs.</p>
  <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Agile methodology successfully applied to data projects can lead to new opportunities.</p>
  <p>Most business leaders don’t have to ponder the nuances of trash collection to this degree, but Heidelberg showcases how something that starts as a germ of an idea can grow in unexpected ways.</p>
  <p>Heidelberg did not start this waste collection project with the idea that the city would end up establishing a business. Project managers used an agile methodology to experiment with what worked and what needed improvement, and they kept going. The project resulted from co-innovation development among all the providers – including software, hardware, and garbage trucks – to which every partner brought expertise and technology to be tested.</p>

  <h2 id="dashboard-pinpoints-road-crash-hotspots-improving-public-safety">Dashboard pinpoints road crash hotspots, improving public safety</h2>
  <p><strong>The project:</strong> To address a rise in road crashes, Tennessee’s Hamilton County built a system using multiple data sources for law enforcement to pinpoint the most crash-prone spots.</p>
  <p><strong>Major benefits:</strong> The resulting dashboard is able to visualize likely hotspots for vehicle collisions, enabling emergency services to position personnel to potentially respond more quickly.</p>
  <p>Just one more sad fact about the pandemic: contrary to reasonable expectations (given that there were fewer cars on many roads), the number of fatal car crashes <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-health-traffic-coronavirus-pandemic-799e455b73902b1638cc2ac46a172972">increased in the state of Tennessee during the shutdown period</a> when there were fewer vehicles on the road. In fact, the number of people killed on U.S. highways rose nearly 5% in the first nine months of 2020, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Tennessee fared worse than the national average, with a 6% rise to 1,004 <a href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/nov/07/tennessee-sees-more-traffic-fatalities/535656/">traffic deaths</a> in 2020.</p>

  <p>Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, had been working since 2019 to build a sophisticated dashboard using a wealth of geographic information system (GIS) data, state crash data from the Chattanooga Department of Transportation, and other public data sources (including Dark Sky weather information) to visualize where the next crash was likely to take place. Funded by the city of Chattanooga, the project cost in the mid-six figures, and the work was done by the Center for Urban Informatics and Progress (CUIP) at the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, according to Reid Belew, marketing manager, CUIP.</p>
  <p>One goal was for law enforcement to use the dashboard to mitigate conditions that are ripe for car crashes, hopefully reducing actual crashes in the process, according to Jeremy Roland, a recent graduate of the CUIP. Another important goal was to enable both local law enforcement and emergency services to more efficiently allocate resources. The hypothesis, still being tested with data, is that strategically locating officers has the potential to reduce response times and improve crash victim outcomes. “This affects things like where they position their police cars for a given day, where they set patrol routes for a given day,” says Roland.</p>
  <p>Urban areas provide business leaders with takeaways on how municipal leaders use data. That includes their development of dashboards that start with one goal and – because the data quality is strong – lead to new, valuable benefits.</p>
  <p>The third goal for the project was to give prescriptive insights to local governments about high-incident crash sites, enabling them to make improvements in some cases that would make the locations safer. For example, Roland says analysts took a closer look at one location in northern Chattanooga with a very high concentration of crashes happening throughout the data set time span.</p>
  <p>“It turns out that at that location, there was a utility pole that had been placed a little too close to the main roadway, often causing crashes,” Roland says. Once the officials made the connection, they were able to move the pole. They plan to track activity in the area to determine if the move correlates with fewer collisions.</p>
  <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Pilot projects are critical to test data analytics hypotheses.</p>
  <p>Location data is just one indicator that the project team is analyzing to measure the dashboard’s effect. Most importantly, the Chattanooga team plans to examine whether emergency response times were reduced and by how much. In the meantime, Roland and his colleagues say they have gotten a very positive reaction from the police department. The team is evaluating future uses of the data.</p>
  <p>In spite of the pandemic, the central role that cities play in our lives, and the economic life of the regions in which we live and work, is <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/future-of-cities-covid-19/">not likely to change much</a>. Pressed to do more with less and to work with academic and business partners, urban areas provide business leaders with takeaways on how municipal leaders use data. That includes their development of dashboards that start with one goal and – because the data quality is strong – lead to new, valuable benefits.</p>

        <p>By defining value to include the long-term impact of business decisions, companies can secure their survival in an unpredictable world.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We are more aware than ever that globalization and its far-flung supply chains extend the consequences of business decisions well beyond the boundaries of the company that makes them. But assigning responsibility to C-suite leaders for how their decisions ripple through their entire business ecosystem is a newer concept that Judy Samuelson believes is both welcome and overdue.</p>
  <p>Samuelson is the founder and executive director of the Aspen Institute Business and Society Program, which brings executives and academics together to align business decisions and investments with societal benefit. After years spent developing the Aspen Principles for long-term value creation, she’s summarized this work in her book <strong>The Six New Rules of Business: Creating Real Value in a Changing World.</strong></p>
  <p>Samuelson argues that a focus on maximizing short-term profits obscures a company’s true risks, blinds it to opportunities, and ultimately leaves it unable to optimize or even understand the long-term worth of its assets and products.</p>
  <p>We asked Samuelson to explain what we’re missing when we talk about value – and how to encourage business leaders to think about it as more than a number on the quarterly earnings statement.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div>Business has an extraordinary power and capacity to address our most complex problems, and it can be a remarkable instrument for the public good as long as we demand that it be the best it can be.</div>

  </div>
  <h2 id="q-why-do-we-need-to-redefine-business-value">Q: Why do we need to redefine business value?</h2>
  <p><strong>Judy Samuelson:</strong> Most of the real value of business today is intangible: employee and customer trust, employee and customer loyalty, the power of ideas, a culture of innovation and problem-solving. Those are hard to measure and compare, and they’re not captured on the balance sheet. If we don’t start to measure value in a robust way that captures the perspective of the people who carry the long-term consequences of our decisions – not only employees and customers but also our suppliers, partners, and the communities where companies operate – we’ll continue the habits and protocols that have negative consequences for everyone, the company and shareholders included.</p>
  <p>Business has an extraordinary power and capacity to address our most complex problems, and it can be a remarkable instrument for the public good as long as we demand that it be the best it can be. Long-term value is at the center of that.</p>
  <h2 id="q-business-leaders-are-ultimately-hired-to-drive-growth-and-profit-why-should-they-stop-considering-those-the-primary-purpose-of-a-company">Q: Business leaders are ultimately hired to drive growth and profit. Why should they stop considering those the primary purpose of a company?</h2>
  <p><strong>Samuelson:</strong> Growth and profit are still important. But people are talking about how a CEO is the leader of a broader community of interest and how a management team needs to be able to think about the ecosystem of the company.</p>
  <p>It’s not sufficient to focus just on profits and growth because these tend to be measured in ways – like the current stock price – that fail to capture the forces that are shaping a company’s survival over time: its ability to operate where it wants, to find and retain talent, to access resources, and so forth. So top management and boards need to be, and are, stepping back and taking the broader view.</p>

  <h2 id="q-what-has-been-the-biggest-barrier-to-moving-business-leaders-beyond-a-singular-focus-on-maximizing-profits-and-growth">Q: What has been the biggest barrier to moving business leaders beyond a singular focus on maximizing profits and growth?</h2>
  <p><strong>Samuelson:</strong> In part, it’s what we pay CEOs to do. Public companies have organized the fundamental metrics for CEO pay around total shareholder return. Someone who’s being paid to keep the stock price high has a literal vested interest in doing whatever has a direct impact on that. But there’s also the matter of what business leaders are taught to do and what boards and corporate counsel expect them to do: prioritize earnings. We need to design incentives to nudge them toward a broader view of value.</p>
  <p>Executives have lots of reasons to close the gaps between their stated intentions to have a positive societal impact and the actual results of their business models, but they’re rarely persuaded by data or a business case. More often, it’s a realization that they need to behave differently.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div>Instead of focusing on profits and share price as the most useful metrics of success, tomorrow’s business leaders will be able to widen their worldviews to include the roles and relationships between and among markets, employees, communities, and governments.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For example, when Lee Scott was CEO of Walmart, the company was getting a lot of negative attention for the social and environmental consequences of a business model that focused on the lowest possible prices. Scott realized he had to counter the idea that Walmart took more from host communities, suppliers, and employees than it gave. When Hurricane Katrina happened, he sent dozens of Walmart trucks with emergency supplies to New Orleans and encouraged local managers to give away inventory to neighbors in need.</p>
  <p>The resulting wave of positive feedback made him realize that the only way to change the way you’re seen is by changing how you lead. So he started the company’s internal sustainability initiative as a way to take leadership on higher product and environmental standards. And that’s creating long-term value, not just in intangibles like loyalty and reputation but also social, environmental, and financial benefits. It’s a fundamental and ongoing shift in the company’s mindset.</p>

You also note that there’s still a lot of resistance to this idea in academia. How do you see things changing?</h2>
  <p><strong>Samuelson:</strong> Every business school in the country, and maybe in the world, has something on its Web site about the role of business leadership in tackling societal challenges as a way to attract students who want to change the world through business. But students enter wanting to learn how to do that and exit as profit maximizers because they’re being taught to pursue certainty in the short term instead of learning to navigate complexities and long-term possibilities.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The technical aspects of how business is taught have not yet caught up to those more future-oriented leadership questions. Fortunately, the modern business school is one of the most multidisciplinary parts of academia. It includes business, economics, finance, psychology – so I do think academia will catch up.</p>
  <p>If we can break down those internal siloes, we can start guiding tomorrow’s MBAs away from the idea that there is only one right answer in any given situation. And that starts opening them up to all the conversations we need to be having about what value really is and how to make sure companies generate it – not just for shareholders but for the society where companies get their resources and customers.</p>
  <p>Instead of focusing on profits and share price as the most useful metrics of success, tomorrow’s business leaders will be able to widen their worldviews to include the roles and relationships between and among markets, employees, communities, and governments. And they’ll learn to synchronize the tools for diagnosing and fixing problems inside their businesses with the best leverage points for large-scale, systemic change.</p>

  <p>Procter &#x26; Gamble, the maker of Charmin toilet paper, was prepared for thousands of <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/05/18/toilet-paper-sales-surge-shortage-coronavirus-pandemic-supply-chain-cpg-panic-buying/">scenarios</a> – including earthquakes, fires, and cybersecurity attacks – but not for a disruption greater in magnitude than all three combined: a global pandemic.</p>
  <p>As COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in March, panicked shoppers snapped up what precious paper products they could find. Meanwhile, P&#x26;G’s “just-in-time” manufacturing and distribution operations meant it had no more than two or three <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/05/18/toilet-paper-sales-surge-shortage-coronavirus-pandemic-supply-chain-cpg-panic-buying/">weeks’</a> worth of toilet paper to sell.</p>
  <p>Other U.S.-based paper goods manufacturers, along with makers of hand sanitizers and cleaning products, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/17/21183911/coronavirus-household-supplies-toilet-paper-hand-sanitizer-face-masks-amazon">experienced</a> similar shortages, not only due to the unanticipated and extraordinary demand, but also because of their heavy reliance on overseas suppliers. P&#x26;G had, in fact, warned <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/procter-gamble-warns-that-coronavirus-will-have-material-impact-on-march-quarter-earnings-2020-02-20">investors</a> in February that virus-induced factory shutdowns in China, where it had nearly 400 suppliers shipping more than 9,000 materials, would affect more than 17,000 products.</p>
  <p>As shipments of products worldwide slowed or stopped entirely, it soon became clear that global supply chains had snapped. Companies everywhere were in trouble. But not every business.</p>

  <p>3M, the maker of N95 respirator masks, was able to <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/17/21183911/coronavirus-household-supplies-toilet-paper-hand-sanitizer-face-masks-amazon">ramp up production</a> to meet skyrocketing demand. Although 50% of hospital masks worldwide are manufactured in China, U.S.-based 3M produces all components of the filters used in its N95 respirator masks at its own factories around the world, and it sources other materials, like the straps and metal nose clips, from regional suppliers. When border restrictions and plant closures stonewalled companies with far-flung supply chains, companies like 3M that could manufacture locally, near their customers, were able to stay productive.</p>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered wide-ranging vulnerabilities inherent in sourcing materials and manufacturing products thousands of miles away from where they are sold, and it’s underscored the urgent need for more <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/integrated-business-planning/what-is-a-resilient-supply-chain.html">resiliency</a>. While catastrophic outbreaks of disease may only happen every few <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF%20HGHI_Outbreak_Readiness_Business_Impact.pdf">decades</a>, material disruptions lasting a month or longer happen every <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/risk-resilience-and-rebalancing-in-global-value-chains">3.7 years</a>. This pandemic won’t be the last event to disrupt global supply chains.</p>

  <p>In an increasingly volatile world, businesses need to <a href="/resources/contingency-planning">prepare</a> for all manner of turbulence, from the impact of climate change and regulatory shifts to protectionist trade policies, among other threats. Companies that shift some aspects of their global supply chain closer to the markets where their customers are will be able to respond more quickly, and thus be better prepared for unexpected risks. Global supply chains won’t disappear, but companies can make it a priority to build a better balance between global and local.</p>
  <p>These changes can’t happen overnight. While some businesses might only need to make a few small shifts in their supply chains, others might need to overhaul them completely. Considering the benefits and drawbacks of localization will help organizations execute the right mix.</p>
  <p>“Some businesses might have had different outcomes in the pandemic if they had better planning in place,” says Alexis Bateman, director of MIT Sustainable Supply Chains, an applied research program within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “They’d know what options are available, they could pivot quicker, and be more agile and flexible than some supply chains have historically been.”</p>

  <h2 id="the-vulnerability-of-global-supply-chains">The vulnerability of global supply chains</h2>
  <p>For the past few decades, global supply chains worked because they were mostly reliable and cost effective. Plentiful, cheap labor reduced costs, and factories became more efficient, making companies more profitable. Those years were stable, too. GDP grew steadily and with few supply or demand shocks. But as chaos reverberated through the pandemic-stricken world, businesses soon learned that their reliance on the trusty global model had actually increased their risk in ways that few had considered.</p>
  <p>“No one was looking at the risk of having all of their sources of supply coming from Asia,” says Lisa Anderson, president of LMA Consulting Group, a supply chain consulting firm. Some companies decided that having multiple suppliers in the region, such as in China and India, covered their risks. Others didn’t want to increase costs to mitigate risks that didn’t seem likely to occur, she explains. After all, while many previous disruptions in the region had caused problems, the impact wasn’t long term. Nor had the effects extended around the globe.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    <div>
      <div>The longer the supply chain, the greater the opportunity for disruption.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Prior disasters, like the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, the Thailand floods that same year, and countless hurricanes, should have prepared affected companies for the fallout from the pandemic. Many didn’t. Bateman blames “organizational <a href="https://www.academia.edu/30732651/Organizational_Amnesia_The_Barrier_to_Organizational_Learning?email_work_card=title">amnesia</a>.”</p>
  <p>“After every disaster, most businesses go back to the way things were, forgetting about how bad it was. They just want to move on,” she says. Sometimes lessons become lost in history – if, say, no employees remain from an event that happened decades ago. Or an organization may not be able to transfer the lessons to areas where they can be used for adaptation or creating value. In a large company, one area may know what to do but their knowledge hasn’t spread across the enterprise.</p>
  <p>“There really wasn’t any expectation that whole countries would be locked down, or that you might have import or export issues,” Bateman says. If it hasn’t happened in the past, it’s not unusual to think it won’t happen in the future – a concept derived from philosophy called inductive <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/inductive-vs-deductive-reasoning#:~:text=What%20is%20inductive%20reasoning%3F,a%20%E2%80%9Cbottom%20up%E2%80%9D%20approach.">reasoning</a>. Because a global pandemic hasn’t disrupted supply chains within the lifetime of most people on Earth (the last one was the 1918 flu pandemic) it’s reasonable for people to think it isn’t likely to happen soon. But that thinking is flawed. “When COVID hit,” Bateman explains, “all the vulnerabilities in many supply chains were pushed front and center.”</p>
  <p>The worst, barely imagined scenario came to pass.</p>
  <p>For companies with the most complex global supply chains, the disruptions were paralyzing. Automotive original equipment manufacturers, for example, source raw materials and turn them into parts and components, like seat frames and bearings. These parts are sold and shipped to automotive assembly locations worldwide, which ultimately sell and transport finished automobiles to dealerships across the globe. When one link in that supply chain breaks – because shipping restrictions prevent the transportation of materials, for example – the others are affected. The longer the supply chain, the greater the opportunity for disruption.</p>
  <p>The solution involves looking closer to home.</p>

  <h2 id="why-local-suppliers-matter">Why local suppliers matter</h2>
  <p>Over the past several decades, global supply chains in many industries have become highly complex. In moving a product across oceans, for example, companies need to coordinate with partners at both locations. Additional parties may need to be involved if a company is consolidating products from multiple plants into one shipment to save money on ocean freight. Then, to efficiently unload a container, more coordination with distributors is necessary to ensure that the correct carrier is ready to pick it up at the terminal.</p>
  <p>There’s also complexity in managing inventory. If a customer no longer needs an order, for example, the company might be able to reallocate stock or switch locations – requiring coordination with the logistics network and manufacturing facilities, which could be located in different countries.</p>
  <p>When supply chains are based locally, some of that complexity is removed, says Josh Nelson, principal in strategy operations at The Hackett Group. Fewer parties, less coordination, and simpler logistics are necessary to move the product from Point A to Point B. Proximity allows companies to be more responsive to customers’ needs – in cases where stock needs to be reallocated, for example – and it also enables a greater level of control over suppliers.</p>
  <p>Having more diverse, shorter, less complex supply chains creates more resiliency, Anderson says. Consider what happened to automakers Ford and Chrysler: when the 2011 earthquake and tsunami rocked northern Japan, a warehouse storing a locally produced chemical used to make pigment in car paint was rendered inaccessible. With this chemical temporarily unavailable, and nowhere else to turn for supply, both companies were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-quake-supplychain/five-years-after-japan-quake-rewiring-of-auto-supply-chain-hits-limits-idUSKCN0WW09N">forced</a> to suspend sales of vehicles in certain colors.</p>

  </p>
  <p>At the root of the problem was a lack of visibility beyond the manufacturers’ Tier 1, and some Tier 2, suppliers (the pigment maker was in Tier 3). It wasn’t unusual for companies to focus on their main suppliers because integrating and reconciling the necessary external data was complicated, Nelson says. “Generally, companies had to directly integrate, or use middleware, requiring the careful matching of master data and transactional data to gain visibility into external partner inventories and associated plans.”</p>
  <p>Today, cloud-based supply chain visibility software makes that integration and resulting collaboration much easier by eliminating legacy integrations and manual data exchanges. Companies that deploy these applications can have near-real-time visibility into their trading partners, suppliers, and customers.</p>
  <p>If a company needs to meet an increase in demand for a certain product, for example, it can review the raw materials a supplier has, which can in turn inform the company about constraints in its supply chain, Nelson says. It can either work through those constraints or schedule around them to avoid supply shortages.</p>
  <p>“The big companies are seeing the value in having visibility into the inventory of their Tier 2 suppliers,” he says. “They are able to optimize the inventory investment across the supply chain and better coordinate schedules across it as well.”</p>
  <p>A year after the tsunami, German company Merck, the maker of that chemical used in auto body paint, relocated some of its production to an additional factory in Germany. The new source of supply enabled the company to both meet <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904563904576586040856135596">demand</a> from global customers and have a backup in case of another disaster.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Proximity can also help companies develop strong relationships with suppliers. The closer one is to the other, the more feasible it is to coordinate factory visits, for example. Factory visits help <a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/buyer-supplier-procurement-site-visit/564768/">companies</a> determine whether a supplier has the necessary leadership, organizational structure, and operational processes to meet their material and service requirements.</p>

  <p>In some cases, localizing supply chains can also be a plus for a company’s branding, Bateman adds, and contribute to <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/what-is-a-sustainable-supply-chain.html">sustainability goals</a>. “Especially since we’re in a recession, bringing some economic input into our own communities is becoming more valued.”</p>
  <p>According to one <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-05-01-IBM-Study-COVID-19-Is-Significantly-Altering-U-S-Consumer-Behavior-and-Plans-Post-Crisis">report</a>, 25% of respondents indicated that they are now shopping more often at locally owned stores and buying locally made, grown, or sourced products. That preference may not disappear when the pandemic is over. Consumers already gravitate to local food products, a 2018 <a href="https://lupinepublishers.com/agriculture-journal/fulltext/an-analysis-of-consumers-preferences-between-locally-grown-processed-food-and-organic-food.ID.000180.php">study</a> found. When two food products – one locally and conventionally grown, and one organic but grown hundreds of miles away – were available in a market at the same time, consumers preferred the locally grown food.</p>
  <p>In addition, for companies working to reduce their carbon footprint, shorter, local supply chains that eliminate shipping from overseas may help achieve that goal.</p>
  <p>Reduced complexity, stronger relationships with suppliers, and an improved ability to cater to customers’ needs make localizing at least some part of a company’s supply chain a smart way to mitigate business risks.</p>

  <h2 id="how-local-can-you-go">How local can you go?</h2>
  <p>Though having some local supply chains is an attractive benefit, it doesn’t always make sense. When making sourcing decisions, companies will still need to consider factors such as cost, manufacturing capacity, and availability of raw materials.</p>
  <p>The most obvious drawback to localization is its cost: where local labor costs can be high, consumers may ultimately feel the pinch in their pocketbooks. Cost savings from transportation might balance higher labor costs, but it’s industry- and product-specific, Bateman says.</p>
  <p>“It’s a balancing act. It won’t ever be perfectly equal in that you’re saving on logistics to offset higher labor costs,” she says. “That’s not to say that shipping is an insubstantial cost, but it’s not on the scale of really high-cost labor, which is why many global supply chains were outsourced to begin with.”</p>
  <p>The investment required to establish local sources of supply can be substantial, too, adds Bruce Twery, partner at Clarkston Consulting. “Moving a plant or building a new plant can be hundreds of millions of dollars,” he says. “[Companies] need to look at those investments through the lens of their specific products, their markets, and their strategy for winning in that market.”</p>

  <p>Manufacturing capacity may also be a limiting factor, Bateman says. Local suppliers may not be able to achieve the scale needed to produce at the volume required. Over the past two decades, manufacturers in Asia have built massive plants with state-of-the-art automation to accommodate demand from global clients. “Often, they just have bigger manufacturing sites,” she observes. “In some cases, they might have more automation that is not necessarily as common domestically.”</p>
  <p>Specialization could be another obstacle. For example, manufacturing some components in products like smartphones and medical <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/bringing-manufacturing-back-to-the-u-s-is-easier-said-than-done">equipment</a> requires sophisticated tools. Considerable training, skills, and experience are needed to operate them – expertise that may not be easily found in a local market. In general, managing the knowledge inherent in the manufacturing of a company’s product may inhibit some changes, LMA Consulting’s Anderson says. “If you were producing in Asia and moving it to the U.S., there’s quite a bit of knowledge that won’t be coming back unless you had dual production.”</p>
  <p>Finally, key raw materials may not be available locally, either. Arsenic and gallium, for example, are widely used minerals in making computer chips, but the chemicals aren’t <a href="https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/which-mineral-commodities-used-united-states-need-be-imported">produced</a> in the United States.</p>
  <p>To be practical, companies will need to find a middle ground where the growing risks of the extended global supply chain are mitigated through localization.</p>

  <h2 id="finding-a-balance-between-global-and-local">Finding a balance between global and local</h2>
  <p>As the dust from the pandemic settles, companies shouldn’t return to business as usual, Bateman says.</p>
  <p>“There’s such a desperation to get back to normal that I fear many people won’t be doing the work to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” she says. Part of that plan to protect against future disruptions can include finding the right mix of global and local suppliers. Consider these questions to gauge where localizing supply chains makes sense:</p>
  <p><strong>Where are your customers and suppliers?</strong> Wherever they are, look at moving at least some nodes in your supply chain closer together, Anderson says. If your suppliers are far away from each other or from your markets, or if they are in places prone to disruptions, locally sourced materials – even at a higher cost – in many cases can ensure continuity, Bateman says.</p>
  <p>Supply chain modeling tools give companies insight into different scenarios, Twery says. “These models run all the possible permutations to help you figure out the right place to put assets like your warehouse and your manufacturing facility.”</p>
  <p><strong>Do you know where your supply chain starts?</strong> Companies usually know the most about where their Tier 1 suppliers are, but beyond Tier 2 becomes hazy – that is, until that Tier 1 supplier can’t obtain a critical material.</p>
  <p>“Companies were blindsided because they had visibility with their Tier 1 supplier, but they had no idea what was happening with their second- and third-tier suppliers,” The Hackett Group’s Nelson says. “They thought they were safe because their suppliers weren’t in Wuhan – but it turns out their second-tier supplier was. This prevented them from being able to react and be agile in response to demand shocks.”</p>
  <p>Because supply chains are so complex, it’s difficult to manually trace the exact source of every material, he adds. Some companies use mapping or geographic information system (GIS) software to trace their supply chains and achieve greater visibility into sources of supply.</p>

  </p>
  <p><strong>What are your transportation costs?</strong> If your product has a high labor cost percentage but it’s lightweight to ship, it may not make sense to bring it back, Anderson says.</p>
  <p>Supply chain network design and optimization tools can provide visibility into cost drivers across the supply chain, Nelson says. “When you have extended supply chains, it’s hard to see the total cost of them. This is where having better visibility into all the cost components helps – conversion costs, materials costs, transportation costs, and warehousing costs,” he says.</p>
  <p><strong>What does scenario planning reveal?</strong> Political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental considerations all play a role in understanding where the next supply chain disruption may come from. Moving forward, <a href="/resources/contingency-continuity-planning-best-practices">scenario planning</a> should also include stress tests for different disease scenarios, Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ca/Documents/finance/Supply-Chain_POV_EN_FINAL-AODA.pdf">advises</a>, including a mild, contained epidemic, a global epidemic, and a global pandemic.</p>
  <p><strong>How complex is your product?</strong> Look at whether there are manufacturers outside your current supply chain that already produce a product that is similar to yours, as well as the locations of materials these manufacturers require. This will affect the speed at which companies can make the move to local.</p>
  <p>“It’s extremely unlikely that you would ramp up 100% overnight,” Anderson says. “Instead, you would put together a transition plan to ramp up with the new supplier before you start reducing volume with the old supplier. You might even keep both long term, as well.”</p>
  <p><strong>Could local be more than a backup?</strong> Because you no longer want to rely on a single source of supply, “you should be looking at backup sources that you actually use,” Anderson says. “A backup supply that you don’t use isn’t really a backup.”</p>
  <p>At a previous company where Anderson was VP of operations, they used a backup supplier in South Carolina for a core supplier in Brazil. The South Carolina supplier was treated as a partner, receiving 20% of the company’s volume throughout the year. When the supply from Brazil became disrupted due to a transportation issue, the South Carolina supplier ramped up production, helping them to cover their needs. Anderson says the company’s ongoing relationship with the South Carolina supplier was key to making this happen.</p>

  <h2 id="building-a-more-resilient-future">Building a more resilient future</h2>
  <p>COVID-19 revealed the weaknesses in global supply chains and underscored the need to build in more resilience. For some companies, sourcing materials, components, or product manufacturing locally will achieve that.</p>

  <p>“COVID was a global game-changer for many, many companies,” Twery says. “In the past, supply chain risk was just an afterthought in the annual planning process at best. Now, COVID has put supply chain resilience on the board-level agenda for the first time.”</p>
  <p>Transitioning to more resilient, less risky supply chains can take time. If materials and alternative manufacturers are easy to find, a company might be able to make a shift within 60 to 90 days, Anderson says. But it could take many more months or even years to reconfigure the supply chain for a complex product.</p>
  <p>What’s important, Bateman notes, is that companies assess their options soon. “You want to capitalize on the crisis when it’s fresh and there’s motivation to do so,” she says. “Visibility and transparency have been a hot topic for years, but it rarely gets deeply implemented. Build in the capabilities you’ve always wanted but didn’t have the drive or imperative to make happen. The time to act is now.”</p>

        <p>Learn how companies can mitigate the risks of artificial intelligence-driven bias and even improve corporate diversity.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By Robin Meyerhoff</p>
  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is often touted as an equalizing technology that removes bias from decisions – but it has not always lived up to its promise. Examples of AI gone awry are easy to find. Google made headlines in 2015 when its image-recognition technology returned photos of Black men if users searched for images of gorillas. And Amazon had to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G">cancel a project</a> to build an AI-driven recruiting engine after it was apparent the tool preferred men over women.</p>
  <p>The problem is that AI is only as good as the data it learns from, and <a href="/resources/how-ai-can-end-bias">algorithmic bias</a> can be inadvertently introduced at any point in the development process. Historical data sets used to train the tool may be biased to begin with. And outcome validation by testers during the development process can skew the way the AI learns.</p>
  <p>But rather than rejecting the use of AI, a community of academics and tech companies are using it to improve corporate diversity by proactively removing cues that may work against traditionally marginalized people. Their goal is to create systems that truly level the playing field, from recruitment through hiring and on to promotion, providing underrepresented groups access to higher-paying jobs commensurate with their skills and education.</p>
  <h2 id="the-racial-wealth-gap">The racial wealth gap</h2>
  <p>Researchers say lack of access to those higher-paying jobs has long-term implications to the underlying U.S. economy. A 2020 Brookings Institution <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/">study</a> found that the net worth of a typical white family is nearly 10 times greater than that of a Black family. And a 2019 McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-economic-impact-of-closing-the-racial-wealth-gap">study</a> found that wealth gap “contributes to intergenerational economic precariousness.” When properly implemented, using AI to reduce workplace racial inequality can improve unequal access to wealth along racial lines.</p>
  <p>More than two-thirds of middle-class Black children, the McKinsey study predicted, are likely to fall out of the middle class as adults. Their loss could cost the U.S. economy as much as US$1.5 trillion in reduced consumption and investment – as much as 6% of the U.S. GDP – by 2028.</p>
  <p>Black people still face considerable challenges in corporate America. A <a href="https://coqual.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CoqualBeingBlackinCorporateAmerica090720-1.pdf">study by Coqual</a>, a think tank and consulting group dedicated to workplace equality, found that Black professionals are generally more ambitious in their careers than their white counterparts, yet make up only 8% of all professionals and 3.2% of executives or senior-level managers.</p>
  <h2 id="barriers-to-professional-jobs">Barriers to professional jobs</h2>
  <p>The barriers to getting into well-paid, professional jobs are significant. Judith Williams, chief diversity and inclusion officer at SAP, says education isn’t the issue. Black students in the United States complete high school at a nearly <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/06/black-high-school-attainment-nearly-on-par-with-national-average.html">equal rate</a> to that of White students – and college graduation is increasing, albeit more slowly. “You need to look at diversity in the talent pipeline – who gets funding and who goes into the [technology] field,” Williams says.</p>
  <p>Peter Bergman, professor of economics and education at Columbia University, believes that solving educational parity helps, but doesn’t remove, all the barriers to financial advancement. “You could take a Black student who lives next door to a white family. Both parents are high earners making the same amount of money, the children live in the same place and attend the same schools – but there will be a great disparity in their outcomes,” Bergman says.</p>
  <p>Social networks, which Bergman points out are not meritocracies, play a critical role in people’s ability to get and keep well-paying jobs or receive promotions. Similarly, algorithms may encode existing bias in new-hire screening processes.</p>

  <h2 id="is-ai-bias-free">Is AI bias-free?</h2>
  <p>“A lot of companies using algorithms as part of their screening processes make claims about fairness and lack of bias that aren’t supported by the evidence,” he says. “For example, they’ll say it’s bias-free because gender or race isn’t included. But that doesn’t mean it lacks bias. You could have two people of equal talent from different groups and the hiring manager will likely interview someone from one group over another.”</p>

        <h3 id="how-ai-can-end-bias">How AI Can End Bias</h3>
        <p>If it's taught to play fair, AI can be a powerful tool for reducing human bias.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="/resources/how-ai-can-end-bias">Read the story</a></strong></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Bergman says this happens because of how variables are correlated. “If race isn’t indicated as a quality to consider, the algorithm latches onto other available variables like the university you attended, job experience, and location.” Those factors often correlate to race and impact who gets a job interview and who doesn’t.</p>
  <p>To move beyond this effect, companies must consider different data. If a company that hasn’t traditionally hired people of color relies on historical hiring data, that data will likely only exacerbate the problem.</p>
  <p>Bergman recommends training algorithms to explore different candidates, similar to how Netflix suggests shows for us to watch. It doesn’t just rely on viewing history – it also offers completely different shows to see if a viewer is open to other types of content.</p>
  <p>“There are a lot of parts to hiring beyond the algorithm. So it’s not just about changing it,” Bergman says. “You have to explicitly incorporate exploration into the algorithm and apply that to the hiring framework.”</p>
  <p>Bergman believes that approach must also be applied to digital HR systems that track data regarding the entire employee lifecycle, from application and interview through hiring and retention. He says, “That’s what we’re hoping to do – develop an evidence-based approach to creating a <a href="/resources/diversity-in-the-workplace">diverse workplace culture</a>.”</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-override-ai-bias">How to override AI bias</h2>
  <p><a href="https://appen.com/">Appen</a> and <a href="https://writer.com/">Writer</a> are two companies that train algorithms to help organizations weed out racism and discrimination in corporate culture.</p>
  <p>Sydney-based Appen provides training data for AI that helps many of the world’s biggest technology companies, including Amazon and Microsoft, develop machine learning, speech recognition, and computer vision algorithms.</p>
  <p>Appen CEO Mark Brayan says the company aims to eliminate two sources of bias. The first is historical data that tends to exclude certain populations. For example, insurance claim payout models may be based on 100 years’ worth of policies sold to white men – which Appen rectifies by providing a more diverse data set.</p>
  <p>The second is bias introduced by the humans that interact with the data. “Humans need to transcribe and annotate data, which brings in their perspective and cultural context,” Brayan says. “People score data’s relevance, which can drift if diverse viewpoints are not represented.” To correct this, Appen uses crowdsourcing to ensure data workers come from a variety of backgrounds, tapping into a network of more than one million contractors globally.</p>
  <p>“People are subject to different conditions, and relevance can be impacted by time, culture, etc.,” Appen says. “Our crowd helps customers map to users’ diversity and demography – and provides unbiased data.”</p>
  <p>Writer, a San Francisco-based startup with customers including Twitter, Discovery Channel, and Intuit, builds AI tools that align language with diversity and inclusion efforts. “People have the best of intentions but don’t always know the correct way to speak about or to diverse groups. We help them do what they intend to do,” says May Habib, co-founder and CEO of Writer.</p>
  <div class="promo">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="qa-how-to-give-ai-a-moral-compass">Q&#x26;A: How to Give AI a Moral Compass</h3>
        <p>To make artificial intelligence behave ethically, humans have to take the lead.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Writer’s tools work by training algorithms on language guidelines created by marginalized groups. “We build on the work done by underrepresented communities. People have spent their careers developing inclusive language and we help it go mainstream,” Habib says. “Alternative suggestions are key and that’s where AI comes in. Writer sits in people’s browsers to make sure that people are being sensitive and creating environments of belonging.”</p>
  <p>For example, technology companies have come under fire for not creating inclusive cultures. Product developers use terms like “whitelist” and “blacklist,” “master” and “slave,” and “dummy.” Habib says, “We help product teams say what they mean – we suggest replacing ‘dummy value’ with ‘placeholder value,’ or ‘blacklist’ with ‘deny list.’”</p>
  <p>While AI can foster more inclusive hiring and employment practices, to truly address the wealth gap companies need to profoundly shift corporate culture. AI can help, but the rest relies on organizational leaders’ will and appetite to enact long-term, sustainable changes.</p>
  <h2 id="gaps-still-persist">Gaps still persist</h2>
  <p>But even tech companies, like those in Silicon Valley, have a long way to go. A <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/nyu-female-job-candidates-more-likely-than-men-to-receive-offers-from-sili/589383/">study</a> by researchers at New York University’s Stern School of Business found that Black, Hispanic, and Asian applicants are 8% to 13% less likely to receive a callback than white applicants for positions in tech companies. These gaps persist throughout the interview and offer processes.</p>
  <p>Bergman explains: “If people really cared about these issues, they’d build systems that create data about the workplace and rigorously evaluate it. They’d put their money where their mouth is and use that evidence to understand the culture better.”</p>
  <p>He adds that culture is multi-dimensional and complex. For example, multinational corporations need to address the different ways that Blackness is understood globally as a social construct. He recommends that organizations approach it in multiple ways and understand the different ways it can be measured.</p>
  <p>Embracing the approaches recommended by Bergman and others gives companies a path to turn well-meaning support for racial diversity into significant change that can create equal opportunities in professional fields – and do their part towards closing the wealth gap.</p>

        <p>Biometric sensors can be a powerful tool to protect public health – but to be effective, we must ensure privacy and trust.</p>

  <p>By Emily Acton and Michael Rander</p>
  <p>The global COVID-19 pandemic is changing how we exist in the world by forcing us to rethink our relationship to public and private spaces. It is a harbinger, too, of public health crises to come, whether these be flareups of known contagions, new emergent diseases, or the spread of pathogens in the warming climate. What we learn and choose to do now to maintain public health – and our own – will have enormous impacts on how we live and interact with the world.</p>
  <p>Given the speed with which pandemics can spread within populations and across geographies, we will need solutions that encompass widespread, real-time monitoring of health data and symptoms, and provide pathways, like alerts, that allow us to use this information effectively and quickly. Public health data that is collected ethically while protecting individual privacy can be used to manage future outbreaks as well as create devices and applications to help us monitor disease, deliver treatment, and improve population health. Biometric trackers, which can gather info on physical states, promise to do just that. There are two types in this context: those unique to an individual, like wearables, and those used in shared spaces that can capture and assess health indicators for groups. Effective biometric solutions offer individual health alerts, help public health officials track and monitor outbreaks, and help limit the spread of harmful germs to help us manage our collective physical, mental, and economic health. But there are also limits and concerns.</p>

  <p>Devices that capture biometric information from individuals are already in use to help individuals identify whether they are becoming ill or are at risk. Wearables like rings, watches, and adhesive sensors have the advantage of being on or near the body, collecting close to real-time data. Many devices also can send location signals, and so can aid contact tracing.</p>
  <p>Some initial forays into using personal biometrics for disease detection have involved repurposing existing consumer devices. One of the many research collaborations to investigate devices for COVID-19 detection is sponsored by Oura Health. The Finnish company’s Oura Rings were originally designed as sleep trackers. Now researchers are testing the rings to see whether they can also track COVID-19 symptoms. The company is working with scientists at West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute and University of California San Francisco, amongst other universities and research institutions. For these studies, medical professionals along with people in the general U.S. population are wearing the rings to track their temperature as well as respiratory and heart rates. The data will be used to develop an algorithm that can predict symptoms and <a href="https://www.sealab.ucsf.edu/tempredict">infection</a>. Early results seem to show that the platform can predict an infection three days before symptoms appear, with 90% accuracy.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Epicore Biosystems is exploring applications for its adhesive skin patch, which was developed for athletes. The single-use patches collect sweat to assess fatigue. For COVID-19 sufferers, it may be able to measures cytokines – proteins produced by the immune system that are also found in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/the-institute/ieee-member-news/sweat-sensing-patch-aimed-athletes-takes-covid19">sweat</a>. So-called “cytokine storms,” when a large amount of cytokines are released, have been linked to complications in COVID-19 patients including multiple organ <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01446/full">failure</a>.</p>
  <p>Northwestern University and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab developed an adhesive patch to treat stroke patients that sits at the base of the throat and measures breathing, coughing, and heart rate. Researchers added temperature and blood oxygen measurements for COVID-19 detection. The collected data can be uploaded to the cloud by removing the patch and placing it on a wireless <a href="https://www.sralab.org/articles/news/band-aid-patch-could-detect-early-covid-19-symptoms">charger</a>. The information is then analyzed by an artificial intelligence (AI) platform which looks for COVID-19 indicators, providing continuous monitoring of health indicators to medical professionals.</p>
  <p>Personal biometric trackers have the potential to provide symptom information before an individual even notices a problem, allowing for better decisions about having contact with others, and prompting people to quickly get medical attention.</p>

  <p>While personal biometric sensors can help individuals make decisions to seek care and take steps to avoid infecting others, embedding ambient biometric sensors in office buildings, gyms, malls, shops, theaters, stadiums, public transportation, and other public spaces could help instill confidence in the safety of those locations by spotting people who may not be aware that they’re potential risks.</p>
  <p>Singapore tapped local company Kronikare to adapt its wound scanning device into a mass temperature reader. The iThermo uses an AI application to scan temperatures in public using smartphones with laser and 3D thermal cameras. People don’t have to line up to have their temperature read, and the person doing the scanning doesn’t have to get close to possibly infected <a href="https://govinsider.asia/innovation/covid-coronavirus-singapore-ihis-kronikare-temperature-ai/">strangers</a>.</p>
  <p>Another option that’s highly scalable and thereby a potential option for large groups like office and retail workers is using voice to assess health. Sonde Health has released a smartphone app called Sonde One which uses a six second recording of a person’s voice to detect respiratory problems. So far, according to the company, the app has a 70% accuracy rate. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are also working on a similar idea. Their COVID-19 Voice Detector matches the vocal sounds with recordings collected from COVID-19 patients, providing a likelihood of infection score.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, architects and interior designers have begun to rethink how existing office space is configured in anticipation of persistent social distancing. Possibilities include smart flooring that creates visual demarcations for safe pathways based on real-time biometric data, smart elevators that can be likewise programmed to limit riders, and apps that aid contact tracing by tracking who employees come into contact with while in the office.</p>
  <p>Public applications for biometrics are one way of helping us maintain social and work lives that are minimally disrupted during pandemics while improving public testing and identifying people needing treatment.</p>

  <h2 id="designing-safer-spaces">Designing safer spaces</h2>
  <p>But with the likelihood that we will have rolling lockdowns as pandemics come and go, interior designers and architects are thinking of how to create spaces that will provide safety and comfort where we live, work, and socialize. They’re imagining a fundamental change in how environments are designed to create flexible and responsive spaces that can quickly be adapted to pandemic situations.</p>
  <p>At the University of Southern California School of Architecture, Project <a href="https://www.architectmagazine.com/design/is-project-heroe-the-audacious-solution-needed-to-stem-future-outbreaks_o">Héroe</a> has created a detailed model for installing emergency medical infrastructure quickly. The plan includes care facilities and housing for care professionals, and it details the logistics involved with launching a massive health response in only a week.</p>
  <p>Concepts like this emphasize the importance of a collaborative, cross-discipline approach to architecture when designing for socio-economic, health, and environmental problems. Embedding biometrics in built environments could inform structural design and usage patterns, provide health alerts, and monitor air quality and virus transmission.</p>
  <h2 id="science-and-privacy-first">Science and privacy first</h2>
  <p>None of the above scenarios can succeed unless backed by independent, scientifically-sound research along with transparency about how the technology works and how it is being used.</p>
  <p>Given the reluctance, or outright refusal, to physically distance or wear masks among some populations, we can expect resistance to being tracked.</p>
  <p>A wearable like a ring or a bracelet might be acceptable and more likely to be used if it’s unobtrusive, comes with stringent privacy controls, and medical or public health professionals can make a convincing case for using it. In other words, people have to agree to use any device that collects personal data; it can’t be forced upon them.</p>
  <p>Expect an increase in the application of biometrics to trigger a push for privacy from researchers, individuals, and some governments. There will need to be strict protocols in place for what is monitored, where the monitoring occurs, who will be allowed to access the results, and who grants permissions. We will also need clear parameters for how data are used, anonymized, stored, and discarded. In the United States, Senate lawmakers introduced the “Exposure Notification Privacy Act” in response to the coronavirus pandemic; it means to curb the types and amount of data that can be collected to track infections.</p>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic could usher in a period of robust scientific and cross-disciplinary collaboration that encompasses health, design, public policy, and more. Experts in interrelated fields have an opportunity to investigate and create new ways of thinking about health data, as well as how to capture and use it.</p>
  <p>If biometric applications can provide sufficient accuracy and privacy, they can be applied to many contexts to improve personal and collective health. That could include providing staff and residents of long-term care homes with excellent predictive and preventative diagnoses. Or keeping travelers safe in airports and aircraft.</p>
  <p>But if there’s too much fragmentation of systems and data, if data is not treated correctly, and if citizens do not have trust in whomever is leading these initiatives, then we’ll not only have wasted people’s tolerance and good will in our efforts to contain COVID-19, we will thwart opportunities to use biometrics to address other public health threats.</p>
  <p>As the incidence of pandemics and our experience with them changes, we will need technology that can evolve along with us to ensure our health and safety. Data from biometric tracking will be essential to our ability to build effective solutions, including the adaptive environments we will need. Biometrics will therefore be crucial in allowing us to avoid extended social isolation periods – making sure we can continue to live human, social lives.</p>
