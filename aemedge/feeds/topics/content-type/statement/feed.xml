      <div><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> has entered into final settlement agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Securities &#x26; Exchange Commission (SEC), and South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). SAP welcomes the conclusion of these matters and will fully comply with the terms of the agreements.</div>
    </div>

  <p>As noted in the settlement agreements, SAP conducted a thorough and extensive investigation into historical misconduct and fully cooperated with the authorities.</p>
  <p>SAP separated from all responsible parties more than five years ago and has since significantly enhanced its global compliance program and related internal controls. Our significant remediation efforts, combined with our full and proactive cooperation with the authorities, have led to full resolutions of these matters.</p>
  <p>SAP has zero tolerance for those who do not adhere to the company’s compliance policies and procedures. SAP remains vigilant in maintaining the highest standards of ethics and compliance so that, together with a global network of customers, partners, suppliers, employees, and thought leaders, SAP can help the world run better and improve people’s lives.</p>

  <div class="text-large">
    <div>
      <div>Russia’s ongoing unjustified war is a heartbreaking display of brutality and a violation of the fundamental principle of freedom that we share with Ukraine. We remain steadfast in our commitment to support Ukraine by stopping all sales and shutting down cloud operations in Russia, fully implementing international sanctions, and donating both technology and humanitarian aid.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>On March 2, we stopped all sales in Russia and then Belarus. We have immediately implemented all international sanctions without exception, and are in constant contact with our government counterparts to remain aligned with their strategies to end this war. We appreciate the resolve and intelligence with which governments have come together on coordinated sanctions and welcome the announcement of new international sanctions expected soon.</p>
  <p>Beyond implementing sanctions and stopping all sales, we are actively shutting down our cloud operations in Russia. We have received questions about SAP’s ability to shut down all existing products for Russian customers. There are customers in Russia that have bought and deployed their SAP products on premise and run these products within their own internal IT departments. This means that regardless of any SAP decision not to provide support or engagement of any kind, these customers are still able to continue using these products independently of SAP.</p>
  <p>To address the humanitarian and refugee needs on the ground, we are using our technology to help multi-national organizations across a range of aid efforts. One focus is ensuring aid groups and healthcare workers can get supplies. On March 9, we enabled suppliers on SAP Business Network to declare their readiness to provide humanitarian aid; some 1,500 have already done so. We’re also helping the Ukrainian government order supplies for hospitals so that they can get urgently needed equipment as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
  <p>Technology is just one of the resources we’re offering. Total donations from SAP and our employees have surpassed €3 million and continue to grow. Over 4,000 employees have offered housing and other aid to refugees. We’re also providing SAP office space to store donations such as medicine and food.</p>
  <p>We stand with the global community in its efforts to stop this unjust war in Ukraine and we remain committed to supporting efforts to restore peace.</p>
  <div class="footnote">
    <div>
      <div><em>Updated April 12:</em> We’ve received some questions about our approach to shutting down our cloud operations in Russia. In providing cloud services, SAP legally acts as a data processor, which means that the customer data within our cloud services always belongs to the customer, never to SAP. This is true for both Russia-based businesses and for multi-national companies working within Russia. With our decision to shut down cloud operations in Russia, we are contractually obliged to provide all non-sanctioned customers legally-compliant options for how their data should be handled — these customers can choose to have their data deleted, sent to them or migrated to cloud operations located outside of Russia. Customers with whom business is prohibited by sanctions were not given these options.</div>

    <div>
      <div>Working capital management aims at securing and optimizing the liquidity of an enterprise. It helps companies effectively make use of current assets and maintain sufficient cash flow to meet short-term goals and obligations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a href="/">Working capital is essential</a> to the health of every business, but managing it effectively is something of a balancing act. Companies need to have enough cash available to cover both planned and unexpected costs, while also making the best use of the funds available. This is achieved by the effective management of <a href="https://taulia.com/glossary/what-is-accounts-payable/">accounts payable</a>, <a href="https://taulia.com/glossary/what-are-trade-receivables/">accounts receivable</a>, inventory, and cash.</p>
  <p>Working capital management is the process of improving the cash conversion cycle for companies across payables, receivables and inventory. The cash conversion cycle, typically represented in days, is the time it takes a business to convert expenses into cash flow. The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is defined as: CCC = DSO + DIO – DPO.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DSO is “Days Sales Outstanding” (Note: a “receivable” is outstanding sales)</li>
    <li>DIO is “Days Inventory Outstanding”</li>
    <li>DPO is “Days Payables Outstanding​”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The liquidity of an enterprise can be tied up in each of these areas. Their cash is “trapped” and cannot be used for other purposes as long as it moves through the supply chain. This needs to be avoided. Decreasing DSO, decreasing DIO and increasing DPO lowers a company’s CCC. In other words, it accelerates their cash flow.</p>
  <p>There are solutions for each area of the cash conversion cycle which help to improve the liquidity situation of the company.</p>

  <h2 id="payables-solutions">Payables Solutions</h2>
  <p>These are “buyer-led,” i.e. the buyer enables the supplier to receive cash earlier. In those cases, the cost of early payment is based on the buyer’s credit rating. Since buyers are usually large companies with access to attractive financing conditions, early payment can be much less expensive for suppliers than other financing options which are based on the supplier’s own creditworthiness. Payables solutions take two primary forms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supply Chain Finance:</strong> The supplier is paid early using funding from a third party. The buyer then pays the funder upon the original maturity of the invoice.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Discounting:</strong> Early payment is made directly by the buyer to the supplier allowing the buyer to obtain a discount on the invoice.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="receivables-solutions">Receivables Solutions</h2>
  <p>These are “seller-led” and allow businesses to receive early payment on their invoices across some or all of their customers.</p>
  <h2 id="inventory-solutions">Inventory Solutions</h2>
  <p>This is a type of short-term funding that helps optimize financing of inventory.</p>
  <p>Compared to other methods of obtaining cash, working capital management is particularly beneficial to businesses, because it is directly linked to receivables and payables of buyers and suppliers. Thus such solutions can strengthen the buyer-supplier relationship and provide financial benefit to both parties.</p>

    <div>
      <div>As we collectively work to turn the corner on the COVID-19 pandemic, the range of impact across the globe is becoming more visible. The surge of infections in India is a call for greater investment to help our collective cause.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Last April, SAP <a href="/2020/04/covid-19-emergency-fund-increased-social-sector-support">established a €3 million COVID-19 Emergency Fund</a>, used to support organizations on the front lines, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC Foundation. Today, we are doubling our commitment by adding another €3 million for a total of €6 million to the COVID-19 Emergency Fund.</p>
  <p>Of this new donation, €1 million will go to COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the <a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator">Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator</a>. COVAX is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), <a href="https://www.gavi.org/covax-vaccine-roll-out">Gavi</a>, and the WHO, as well as long-term SAP partner UNICEF. Its aim is to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.</p>
  <p>Beyond that donation, we will use the emergency fund to support India-based employees, their families, and the communities in which they live and work. Kulmeet Bawa, president of SAP India, and Sindhu Gangadharan, senior vice president and managing director of SAP Labs India, are doing everything possible to support the massive relief effort on the ground. Local SAP India teams are facilitating vaccination to employees and their families at our SAP Labs India facilities.</p>
  <p>In parallel, SAP continues to work closely with non-profit organizations and strategic partners, including the NASSCOM Foundation and UNDP India, to support the community to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Augment public health and healthcare infrastructure</li>
    <li>Offer preventative care measures for citizens, including SAP employees</li>
    <li>Deliver homecare support for citizens, including SAP employees</li>
    <li>Conduct awareness and sensitization campaign for COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The battle against COVID-19 affects all of us; we can only win it together. As a company with more than 103,000 employees from 145 countries and cultures, we share in the global responsibility to address the devastating impacts of this pandemic.</p>
  <p>Beyond our social commitments and <a href="/2021/03/resilience-people-covid-19-workplace">support of our global employee base</a>, SAP remains committed to the <a href="https://www.sap.com/covid-19.html">success and resilience of our customers</a>. Progress has been made, but the fight is far from over.</p>
